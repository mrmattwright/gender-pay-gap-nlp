Alumasc Group PLC has a long standing heritage of excellence in the manufacture and supply of engineering and construction products dating back to the middle of the twentieth century. Since flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 1986, the emphasis of the Alumasc Group has shifted away from precision engineering and towards specialised building products, both organically and through acquisition. Alumasc Exterior Building Products Ltd was born out of the amalgamation of Alumasc Rainwater, Harmer Drainage (now combined to form Alumasc Water Management Solutions), Euroroof (now Alumasc Roofing) and MR (now Alumasc Facades). Alumasc is uniquely positioned to be able to offer holistic roofing, walling and drainage specifications that are supported by our technical experts and backed by a comprehensive range of warranties.  About Alumasc Group Alumasc Group PLC is a group of UK-based companies that supply premium building products, systems and solutions into the UK and export construction markets. Alumasc’s heritage dates back to the middle of the 20th century and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1986. Throughout its history, Alumasc has enjoyed considerable success in the manufacture of precision engineering components, beer barrels and construction products. However, the trend for manufacturing to shift away from the UK towards lower cost economies has led Alumasc to divest itself of its interests in the engineering sector and to focus on its core building product activities. Alumasc businesses have strong positions in one of four business segments: Roofing & Walling (Alumasc Roofing & Alumasc Facades) Water management (Alumasc Water Management Solutions) Solar shading & architectural screening (Levolux) House building & ancillary products (Timloc)  Corporate & Social Responsibility Our values determine our behaviour and underpin the way we do business and treat one another. This code aims to guide our actions and those of people with whom we work closely, encouraging a way of working which is honest, responsible and generates trust: Honesty and fairness We are open and honest and try to act fairly; We compete vigorously, but honestly; We treat people with fairness, respect and decency; Employees must be professional, mature and responsible; Employees should avoid conflicts with the interests of the Company.
