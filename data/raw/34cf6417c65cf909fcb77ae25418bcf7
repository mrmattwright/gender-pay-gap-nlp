Stephen James Group – Gender Pay Gap 2017  The Stephen James Group is an authorised BMW and MINI car dealership based in London and Kent, with 4 BMW and 3 MINI centres serving Blackheath, Bromley, Enfield and Ruxley/Sidcup.    One of the core values is People Obsession and our reward strategy incorporates pay plans that ensure we pay the same money for the same roles / value add, regardless of gender.  Many roles at Stephen James give the employee the opportunity to earn based on their personal productivity or the profitability of their department, retail site or the business as a whole. We deem these roles to be “productive” and they are generally regarded as generating income for the business.  Two of the roles where this potential opportunity is the highest are the Technician and the BMW Sales Executive and these roles, although open to all employees regardless of gender as part of our equal opportunities recruitment policy, are entirely unrepresented by full-pay relevant females at the snapshot date, perhaps because these are viewed as traditionally males roles.  At a Board meeting on 31st October 2017, the Board acknowledges the need to encourage females into roles as Technicians and BMW Sales Executives.  It should be noted that of the 108 full-pay relevant employees in productive roles, just 4 are female.  It may also be noted that the mean gender pay gap of these productive roles is 21.3% in favour of females   I confirm that the above published information is accurate.
