Proportion of M/F in a upper quartile 
 
 
KT & T Ltd found out that there was No Gender pay gap on mean salaries between male and
 
female employees, and -2.3 % pay gap on the median hourly rate. This means that there is a
   
very slightly higher rate of pay for female employees at KT&T Ltd. 
 
Across KT&T Ltd the same percentage (2.3 %) of female employees and of male employees
 
 
 
received bonus payments. The average bonus for a female employee is much larger than the
average one for a male employee because senior management at KT&T is predominantly
 
 
females. 
This is where we need to work more, by aiming to attract more males in a female environment. 
 
 
The distributions of males and females within each quartile shows that there is a higher
percentage of female staff than male staff in each of them due to the fact that the number of
 
female employees is about twice as the number of male employees at KT&T Ltd. The percentage
 
is increasing along the pay scale as more females are involved in higher pay jobs within the
 
company. 
 
KT&T Ltd is committed to promoting gender pay equality, and working towards to positively
 
 
influence any pay gaps.  
 
I confirm that
 
 
 
legislation.
