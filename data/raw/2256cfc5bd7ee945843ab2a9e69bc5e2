As educators we all want students to eat better, and yet their dining choices are very rarely influenced by overt health messages, or tables groaning with crunchy vegetables. The major drivers continue to be taste, cost and convenience.  That’s why Cucina’s menus are interesting, fun and different. Our approach, which we call stealthy eating has helped us more than double the uptake of school dinners in sites across England. It has also enabled our partner schools to significantly reduce their catering costs.  More [+]   Our food, handmade on site by skilled chefs and attractively presented, is largely sourced from fresh UK ingredients. It’s also full of nutritional goodness, but that isn’t something we like to shout about. Our customers continue to choose ‘healthy’ simply because that’s the food they like to eat.  Isn’t this the way it should be, after all?   Teaching through their tastebuds  Healthy food? Absolutely. Although young customers tend to put it in other ways, like, ‘wicked’, ‘the future’, ‘gorge(ous)’, ‘cool’, ‘way better than the shops’, and ‘Mum, I want school lunches’.  The more that students like our food, the more they get to know about it. Then, with the help of chefs and kitchen staff, they start to try other options.  We KNOW that eating well is crucial to improving ability and behaviour. In helping students to eat better, Cucina aims to impart a genuine love of great food and help grow knowledge in the process.

The first day Steve took over we took more money in a day than we used to in a week and now over 600 girls enjoy a cooked meal at lunch time.” Lynda Lorentzen, Bursar Southfield School for Girls                 Our News...
