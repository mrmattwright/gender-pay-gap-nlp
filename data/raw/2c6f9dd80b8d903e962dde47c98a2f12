Of the 296 employees, ScarsdaleVets employed 34 men and 262 women as can be seen in the table below, breaking down all our colleagues by their department within the business.  The Veterinary Profession as a whole is becoming increasingly female dominated. ScarsdaleVets is no exception to this development with a male to female ratio of almost 1:8 within our organisation. Veterinary nursing is by far the largest female dominated area with a 1:24 ratio. There are only a couple of hundred registered male nurses in the country, we employ 3 within our practice and so over-index on the levels of male nurses within the profession (national average is 1:45).

The table shows that although we provide equal pay to all colleagues for the job they perform, our highest paid colleagues have a more even gender split than the lower paid roles (though this split is still female biased). This, rather than disparity in role specific pay, creates the gender pay gap differentiation.  ScarsdaleVets is committed, and always has been, to fair and equal pay. We have tried to remain above the national living wage for all our employees though there have been times when we have been equal to the NLW. We have never knowingly fallen below this level.  Recruitment & Retention  When recruiting, ScarsdaleVets adopts a policy of the best person for each role, irrespective of gender, sexuality, race or religion. Our recruitment follows a structured process and allows for roles to be advertised widely (sometimes internationally) to ensure we attract the best candidates for the role, as well as promoting internally where appropriate. We engage with trade press, social media and agencies in the pursuit of recruiting the right people who will enhance our business and we have never (and never will) direct recruitment towards a specific gender. We are committed to developing the talent within our teams and provide extensive opportunities for clinical and non-clinical continuing professional development.  Longevity of service salary disparities are removed from our business by a banding structure (which moves in line with our cost of living increase provision) and we apply the COL for all colleagues annually to ensure our rate of pay remains level or above the annual CPI for the country whenever possible.  Salary Structures  Our salary structure does not differentiate gender, therefore, as per law, any two employees carrying out the same role will be paid identically. Our differentiators in salary only occur where the colleague has an advanced level of skill in the execution of their role and we have clear bandings that detail this that are available to all our colleagues.  In the past the business had a bonus system that was considered to be potentially biased towards fee earners. This was considered unfair in 2016 and the business now provides a group wide bonus scheme that all colleagues can benefit from regardless of role. The bonus has a profit gateway and is then based on both task oriented objectives and behavioural competencies and is calibrated across the business to ensure it is fair.  The business benchmarks all roles in terms of salary. This ensures our rates of pay are competitive in both the local environment and profession specific market places and removes the risk of losing talent to competitors because of money. Our benefits include generous annual leave, birthdays off, employee assistance programme, CPD allowance, wellbeing initiatives and bonus scheme.  ScarsdaleVets has an LLP structure with 12 Partners (10 designated and 2 associate) at the time of the gender analysis being completed. The split in both aspects of Partnership were split equally by gender.  Additional Information  The second largest area of gender disparity is within the client care team. Our business has a male to female ratio in this key area of 1:23. Historically the business had termed ‘Client Care Advisors’ as ‘Receptionists’. Our view was that this felt gender biased to women and so changed the name in 2016 to Client Care Advisor to remove any possible stereotype bias.
