Gender Pay Gap  
Report 2017

What is a gender pay gap?
It’s the difference between the average earnings of men and women, regardless of 
their role or seniority. 

The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 state that 
employers with at least 250 employees are required to publish metrics on pay gaps 
within each organisation from 1 April 2017. We will report Flagship and RFT data 
separately as two legal entities. There is no requirement to report Gasway figures 
this year, due to its employee numbers.

The regulations require employers to report annually, and within 12 months using 
April payroll data. Flagship and RFT do not currently pay bonus payments so will  
only report mean and medium gender pay gaps and quartile bands.

Gender pay
Most organisations in the UK have a gender pay gap. Flagship Group is confident 
that its gender pay gap is not due to paying men and women differently for the 
same or equivalent work. Our gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men 
and women tend to work and the salaries that these roles attract.

‘family friendly’ policies,

and meaningful objectives 
within their individual personal 
objectives and development 
plans (PODP’s).

Ask employees what 
other benefits they would 
like to have available 
whilst working with us.

Use gender-neutral job 
evaluation tools to ensure

of  both men and women 
within the organisation
