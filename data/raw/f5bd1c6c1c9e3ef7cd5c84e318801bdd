Our first annual figures were calculated as of 5 th April 2017 using the prescribed calculation methodology as provided through our Cascade HR and Payroll system.  Break Female’s Hourly rate is:  10.3%                3.6%  Lower                Lower  (Mean)              (Median)     At the mean level the pay gap is 10.3% but this narrows to 3.6% when the median is calculated.  While some organisations struggle to achieve proportional representation of female staff in the more senior higher paying roles this is essentially not the case at Break. The top quartile ratio of  74% females to 26% males is very similar to the whole organisation’s ratio of 77% females to 23% males. At Break the gap is principally because there is an under representation of males in the lower quartile pay bands. The lower pay bands in Break relate almost exclusively to roles within the retail division. Break always strives to maintain a differential between the lowest scale points and the National Living Wage rate and it expected that the Gender pay gap will close as the impact of National Living Wage rises nudge the lower quartile pay rates higher.  Pay Quartiles   Top Quartile  Males  25.9%      Females 74.10%  Upper Middle Quartile  Males 30.90%     Females 69.10%  Lower Middle Quartile  Males 21%          Females 79%  Lower Quartile  Males 8.6%         Females 91.40%    Bonus Pay  At Break the only bonuses paid are commission payments on shop sales.  Less than 50 employees received these payments.  Who Received Bonus Pay  5.70%   Males     15% Females  The commission payments are relatively small sums with the highest individual payment  Just over £1300.  Women’s Bonus Pay is  24.50%           36.5%  Lower             Lower  (Mean)          (Median)   There are very few males that receive commission payments but they are managing some of the bigger and most successful shops and achieved median commission amounts of £791 compared to  The female median commission of £502.         347  permanent staff, 98 relief staff and 915 volunteers       Share This...
