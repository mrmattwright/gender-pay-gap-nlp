Our exceptional team of more than 4,200 people are central to achieving our success and the ongoing investment in the training and development of all of our people remains a priority for the Group.  This year we have again delivered close to 4,000 days of formal training, accredited to National Standards, in a diverse range of areas including customer service, health and safety, sales and administration and management skills.  We are also proud of our award-winning apprenticeship programme.  DFS firmly believes in the benefits of a diverse workforce.  Our Board of Directors has equal numbers of men and women and we have established a Diversity Working Group to develop and implement new and ongoing initiatives to further improve our gender balance across our business.  This includes the publication and ongoing review of our gender pay gap reporting .  We are committed to promoting a positive health and safety culture throughout DFS, and have continued to invest in training and in improving our processes and practices to ensure that we operate safe and secure workplaces no matter where they are.  Employee remuneration is structured to reward high performance and DFS provides a wide range of additional benefits to support the health and welfare of our employees and their families, including life and critical illness cover and an employee assistance service.  Communication of the Group’s strategy and business development is made regularly through presentations by senior management and newsletter or email updates. Employee views are sought through regular feedback sessions with directors and an active programme of employee engagement surveys, the results of which are communicated back to staff.   We continue to obtain external recognition for excellence in employee conditions by our established Top Employer certification from the Top Employers Institute.          @DFS 2018      Accessibility    Terms of use    Cookie policy    Sitemap    Corporate Address      @DFS 2018    By Emperor
