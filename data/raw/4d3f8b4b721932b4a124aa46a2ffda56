UK gender pay 
gap report 

April 2018 

The UK Gender Pay Gap report details the gender 
pay gap reporting requirements under the Equality 
Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 
2017. It outlines data for Alcatel-Lucent Telecom 
Limited and Nokia Solutions & Networks UK 
Limited as at April 2017. 

Introduction 
At Nokia, we believe a diverse workforce is a platform 
for greater innovation, organizational performance, and 
customer-service excellence. Our ambition is to have a 
gender balance that reflects the world around us, and 
a workplace where both men and women have equal 
opportunities to succeed in every function and at 
 
every level. 
Nokia continues to comply with long-standing UK Equal 
 
Pay legislation, requiring equal pay for men and women 
who perform work which is the same or similar, or of 
 
equal value. 
The new Gender Pay Gap Reporting legislation in the UK 
takes a different approach, comparing the mean/median 
pay and bonus of all men with that of all women within a 
business, not only in comparable or similar roles. Neither 
the mean or median numbers specifically measures job 
roles of same value, grade, position, location, education, 
experience, or other generally accepted job criteria used.

The mean calculation takes an average of all Nokia UK male 
employees’ pay and compares it to the average of all Nokia 
UK female employees’ pay, and the result is the percentage 
difference between those two averages. 
The median takes the midpoint pay amount amongst 
all Nokia UK male employees pay (midpoint in highest to 
lowest) and compares that figure to the midpoint pay 
amount amongst all Nokia UK female employees, and 
 
the result is the percentage difference between those 
 
two midpoints. 
Hence, the numbers below account for the overall 
demographics of men and women across the organization, 
reflecting structural issues such as the lower representation 
 
of women in senior leadership, or sales positions, and 
 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) 
 
roles, all of which tend to have higher pay driven by 
specialist skills and expertise. This also has an impact 
 
on bonuses for senior leadership and sales positions.

Nokia started executing a 5-year strategy on gender balance in 2016, empowered by our leaders’ conviction 
and actions. That said, we recognize that we need to do more to address the structural issues that are the 
root causes of Nokia’s pay and bonus gaps in the UK. 

 
Action plan 
Leadership is the first step and we take it very seriously, 
training our leaders, managers and employees on gender 
balance best practices. We are also levelling the playing 
field for women in leadership development through our 
Women in Leadership programs, and we are making sure 
that our leaders, experts, and employees, whatever their 
gender, have a voice in our company and represent Nokia. 
Nonetheless, Nokia recognizes that there is still a gender 
imbalance, so our aim is to further address this by: 
 
•  Designing and deploying Gender balance initiatives 

in each Nokia unit, notably to attract more women in 
leading R&D and Sales roles. 

•  Our Chief Customer Operations Officer, Ashish 
 

Chowdhary, sponsors a Women Forum of 12 Sales 
leaders in business networking, coaching, career 
counselling and executive mentoring. 

•  In Mobile Networks, several leaders have sponsored 
 

a Talent Development Program for 20 women 
across diverse roles and geographies, encompassing 
networking, reverse-mentoring and sponsorship. 

•  Improving our Gender Balance in our recruitment 
 
 

and selection processes, including recruiter training 
 
and diverse candidate lists. 

•  Equipping our leaders and managers with gender 
 

balance best practices. We introduced awareness to 
action workshops aimed at developing inclusive leaders, 
enabling managers to best grow and manage diverse 
teams, and creating awareness of unconscious biases 
that may exist when hiring and promoting talent. 

•  Supporting female career progression by introducing 
 

development programmes to help level the playing 
field and ensure we proactively help women reach their 
potential. We have gathered 50 women from each of 
our business units globally, into a one-year leadership 
journey. This follows our Nokia recipe, which blends 
executive sponsorship with skills development, coaching 
and networking. 30% of the 2017 participants have 
already moved to roles with broader responsibilities.
