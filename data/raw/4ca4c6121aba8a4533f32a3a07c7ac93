We are a highly people-oriented business and corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an integral part of the way we work, at every level of the company.   Our CSR activities are focused on four areas: community, environment, marketplace and workplace, and support the Walgreens Boots Alliance CSR commitments .

We're committed to helping the fight against cancer, and do so by creating large fundraising events in which our employees can participate, often with support from our generous customers, suppliers and partners.   Raising funds for the research and treatment of cancer  Since 2012, we've raised and donated over ¬£700,000 for the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Cancer Research Fund, to support the partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance and the creation of the first-pan European Biobank for colorectal cancer.  This year, we held our annual Championship event in two locations, in the north at Manchester, and in the south at Sunbury-on-Thames. More than 20 football and 6 netball teams battled it out on the sports fields, and with generous sponsorship from suppliers and partners, we raised over ¬£40,000 for the EORTC.

Alliance Healthcare UK Complete "London to Paris Velodrome Challenge" In Style  In June 2017, Alliance Healthcare UK set out to raise ¬£15,000 for CLIC Sargent ‚Äì children's cancer charity, by 31 December 2017.  As part of the fundraising activities, 28 team members from the Alliance Healthcare Support Centre recently completed an exciting London to Paris velodrome challenge at the famous Lee Valley Olympic Velodrome, in London.  The team managed to travel a combined distance of 705km (2,824 laps) - that's 5km more than the required target (2,820 laps) - to travel collectively from London to Paris ‚Äì and back!

Raising funds to help the care and support of cancer patients, their friends and family members    Sport challenges and "go green week" raise ¬£10,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support In 2016, 16 Alliance Healthcare team members braved the Windsor Triathlon competition, collectively covering an impressive 362km. The event tested the participant's endurance, swimming 1.5km in the River Thames, cycling 40km across Berkshire, and finishing with an uphill 6km run outside Windsor Castle. The team also organised a creative "go green week" at the Support Centre in Chessington, where team members dressed in green, baked cakes, held a charity quiz and enjoyed a summer BBQ party in aid of Macmillan. Over summer, a driver from the Alliance Healthcare South Normanton Service Centre set off on a gruelling 24-hour cycle challenge, from Newcastle to London, completing a whopping 310 miles in 18 hours, 47 minutes, and finishing seventh in a field of 700 participants. Also in the warmer months, keen fishers from the business came together at Monks Lake, Kent, for the annual Alliance Healthcare fishing competition.      "Fantastic Four" Challenge raised over ¬£10,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support    In April 2017, team members organised an incredible 40-hour challenge, where four employees travelled over 1,000 miles, across four countries, to visit all 18 Alliance Healthcare sites, as well as making two special pharmacy customer pit-stop visits, in just under 40 hours. The team, known by colleagues as the "Fantastic Four", had to take on special challenges, voted for by colleagues, and draw a nationwide raffle for colleagues at each site, raising even more funds for Macmillan Cancer Support along the way!

Workplace  Alliance Healthcare proactively supports the personal health and wellbeing of its employees.  Through the following four key goals, we strive to create a workplace that treats everyone with dignity and respect.   Employee health and wellbeing   To proactively support the personal health and wellbeing of our employees.   Reducing Inequalities    To continually embrace diversity across the business, through education and awareness. We strive for equal opportunities and equality.     Gender Pay Gap Report   On Tuesday 20 March we published our first Gender Pay Gap Report (2017).   As a business we are encouraged that our median pay gap figure of 7% is significantly less than the national average which is 18.4%, and our mean pay gap figure of 8% is significantly less than the national average of 17.4%. It is important to recognise that the demographic of our organisation is made up of 63% males and 38% females. But we recognise there is still work to be done to reduce the gap further.   Our CSR activities continue to grow, and we have some exciting plans to increase the awareness on all equality issues across the business, starting with the upcoming internal announcement for our Equality Committee, and the launch of our internal equality survey.   The Alliance Healthcare UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 can be found here.   .   Health and safety   To continuously improve our robust approach to health and safety, actively caring for our colleagues and customers, throughout the Company.
