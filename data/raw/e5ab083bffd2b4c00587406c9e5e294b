The report must show the difference between the average earnings of men and women.  We welcome this new reporting because we are confident that at SES Water men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs, regardless of gender. However, we do have a gender pay gap of 15.8%, which is caused by having fewer women in senior roles in the Company. This is not uncommon in the utilities industry as the STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) fields have been predominantly male occupations with historically low participation among women. In fact, just 21% of the core STEM workforce in the UK are women (WISE UK statistics 2016) and the UK has the lowest percentage of female engineering professionals in Europe.  Although our gap is lower than the national average, the challenge for us - and all employers - is to eliminate any gap. At SES Water we believe in creating a diverse and gender-balanced workforce which ensures equal opportunities for all employees and reflects the customers we serve. Some of the actions we are taking to ensure we continually challenge ourselves to be more inclusive include reviewing our recruitment process and evaluating our appraisal system to ensure that capable employees, regardless of gender, can progress.  This statement and information published is a true reflection of our position.
