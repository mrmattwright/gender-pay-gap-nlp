Framework’s gender pay gap  Framework employ over 900 full and part-time employees, on various pay and grading structures: Framework’s own structure, Agenda for Change, Probation and others due to TUPE transfers.  The majority of salaries are linked to a grade with a set pay range: staff move through the pay range based on length of service irrespective of gender.  Framework pay 90% sick pay and this along with other absence where less than full pay received, has resulted in 13% of the workforce being excluded from the report  The gender pay gap data for Framework for the snap shot date of 5 th April is as follows:    Pay quartiles by gender:   Summary from the Senior Management team at Framework  The mean gender pay gap for Framework is 8.98%, whereas the median gender pay gap is 3.52%. Work continues to be undertaken to reduce the gender pay gap in the organisation and we are committed to fair pay and reward irrespective of gender.  Actions for Reducing the Gender Pay Gap  Having consulted extensively we will implement a new pay and grading structure (that affects 82% of our staff) from 1 April 2018 that will add consistency and transparency to our pay, based on non-discriminatory factors.  Framework will set up a working group to create a package of support for females returning to work after a break.  We offer an overall rewards package made up of a variety of pay and non-pay benefits that will be reviewed in 2018 as part of our new Organisational Development Plan.  We offer employees a wide range of flexible working options to enable them to effectively manage their work/life balance.  We have introduced a new appraisal process and behavioural competencies framework for managing performance and development, as part of our new 3-year Organisational Development Plan.  A succession planning element will be developed as part of the appraisal process in 2019, which will enable staff to discuss their career aspirations once a year.  A training curriculum for each role in the organisation has been developed and is now in action, including training for aspiring managers.  We appoint people to roles based on merit regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, disability or belief/non-belief.  We will be reviewing our recruiting training.  Equality and Diversity training is mandatory for all employees.  In April 2017 we launched a new Equality and Diversity 3-year action plan after extensive consultation.  The plan includes action to meet the objectives of ‘to promote behaviour that ensures non-discriminatory practice’ and to ‘have a diverse workforce who are confident and supported to discuss and address diversity issues’.  Through the staff council, consisting of elected staff representatives and trade union stewards, Equality and Diversity issues are discussed, including the gender pay gap.  The Diversity Leadership Group continue to monitor carefully diversity data to identify any areas of potential concern, so appropriate action can be taken.  The Framework Board receive an annual report which includes a breakdown and analysis of our workforce profile.  We will be transparent with our employees and the Board about our gender pay gap and will encourage them to contribute to ideas for continuing to close and eliminate the pay gap in the future.
