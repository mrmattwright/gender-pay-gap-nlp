This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our company: it does not involve publishing individual employee data. The data for 2016/17 has been completed and verified by Carron Creelie, Commercial Director and is detailed below: Women’s hourly rate is 0.9% lower (mean) and 0.1% lower (median) Top salary quartile has 36% men and 64% women Upper middle salary quartile has 33% men and 67% women Lower middle salary quartile has 30% men and 70% women Lower salary quartile has 29% men and 72% women Women’s bonus pay is 0% lower (mean) and 0% lower (median) 0% of men and 0% of women received bonus pay We are delighted that the results of our reporting confirm that pay awards and progression within the company are not based on gender. We pride ourselves on being an equal opportunities employer.
