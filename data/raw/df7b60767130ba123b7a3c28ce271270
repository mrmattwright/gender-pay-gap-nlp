GENDER PAY GAP  
REPORT 2017

Foreword 

At Diageo, our ambition is to 
become one of the most trusted 
and respected consumer products 
companies in the world. We are 
driven by a core belief that successful 
businesses are those that harness the 
benefits of a truly diverse and 
inclusive culture.

Women currently make up 44% of our Board, 
40% of our Executive Committee and more 
than 30% of our global senior leadership team. 
In April 2018, our Board will reach gender parity 
when Ursula Burns takes up her position as 
Non-Executive Director. Diageo was ranked third 
in the 2017 ‘Hampton-Alexander Review FTSE 100 
for Women on Boards and in Leadership’. We are 
proud of the progress we have already made 
towards gender equality in our business and have 
a clear ambition to deliver more. We have recently 
increased our goal for female representation on 
our global senior leadership team to 40% and 
we intend to achieve this target by 2025. 

Women are already 50% of our global graduate 
hires; in Scotland this year, nearly 30% of our 
new apprentices were women; and our career 
development programmes have an equal intake 
of women and men to attract, retain and grow 
the best talent. We have a number of initiatives 
in place that have contributed to this progress, 
and we know there is more to do. 

In this report, we provide our gender pay gap 
information for both our Great Britain and Scotland 
businesses; identify the causes of the pay gap and 
outline our plans for closing this gap. We are clear 
on our ambition to go further and we will deliver 
more opportunities for women, as we move 
towards making Diageo the UK company women 
want to join.

Measuring the pay gap 

The gender pay gap shows the 
difference in average pay between 
women and men. It does not 
measure equal pay, which relates 
to what women and men are paid 
for the same or similar jobs or work 
of equal value. 

Calculating our numbers
Under the UK Government’s new Gender Pay Gap 
regulation, companies need to report their gender 
pay gap for all legal entities in Great Britain with 
more than 250 employees. 

Diageo employs approximately 4,500 people 
across the two legal entities in Great Britain 
covered by the regulations: Diageo Great Britain 
(1,300) and Diageo Scotland (3,200).

•   Diageo Great Britain employs those involved in 

support and global functions, the packaging 
of beer and the distribution, marketing, import 
and sale of beer and spirits.

•   Diageo Scotland is primarily a 24/7 

manufacturing business and employs those 
involved in the distillation, warehousing, 
maturation, bottling and packaging of Scotch 
whisky and other spirits. 

We are also providing combined gender pay 
data for all employees across Great Britain, which 
includes employees in legal entities with fewer 
than 250 employees. Our figures exclude our 
employees in Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland 
is not covered by these reporting regulations.

In this report we are sharing the median and 
mean (average) pay gaps between men and 
women’s hourly pay and bonuses.

The median pay gap for employees 
across these businesses is +8.6%, 
significantly lower than the Office of 
National Statistics (ONS) Great Britain 
(England, Scotland and Wales) median 
of 18.8%.

The gap is primarily driven by our 
manufacturing business in Scotland, 
where we have a large number of 
manufacturing roles held by men, 
consistent with demographics in 
the wider manufacturing sector. In 
particular, shift patterns requiring 
employees to work unsociable hours 
attract a shift allowance, and women 
are less likely than men to work these 
shift patterns. 

Numbers as at 5 April 2017

Additionally, in Scotland a smaller 
proportion of women than men 
currently occupy senior leadership roles. 
We are making progress in this area, but 
due to low levels of voluntary turnover 
within our Scotland business, we have 
had limited opportunities to progress 
women into senior leadership roles.

Our median combined bonus gap is 
-275.9%. This is because the median 
man works in an operator job in our 
manufacturing operations while the 
median woman works in one of our 
functional roles. As the bonus targets in 
our functional roles are higher than in our 
manufacturing operations this results in 
the female median bonus being larger 
than the male median bonus.

Understanding our pay gap

4/7

Diageo Great Britain

Diageo Scotland

There are 1,300 employees in our Great Britain business, 
which employs all our England employees, a large 
number of whom are based at our global headquarters 
in London. These are largely office based roles across 
functions such as marketing, finance, procurement,  
HR, information systems and sales.

The median pay gap in our Great Britain business 
is -9.8%. This reflects the fact that there is a higher 
proportion of men in more junior field sales and 
manufacturing roles, and a higher proportion of 
women in our office based functional roles. On average, 
office based functional roles sit at a higher job level 
than field sales and manufacturing roles, resulting in 
a higher hourly rate for women at the median.

There are 3,200 employees in our Scottish business. 
Diageo Scotland is a business that operates a number 
of 24/7 distilling and packaging sites along with 
warehousing operations and our cooperage and 
coppersmith workshop.

In Scotland, our median pay gap is +16.7%. This pay  
gap is driven by a larger number of manufacturing 
roles, which traditionally struggle to attract women, 
in part, due to unsociable shift patterns. These roles 
can attract higher levels of shift allowance and are more 
likely to be staffed by men. Men are also more likely  
to be in the higher paying manufacturing roles such  
as coopers and craft technicians, due to the nature of 
the work and elements of heavy manual labour.

In our Great Britain business, our median bonus pay gap 
of +12.3% is driven by two factors: a higher proportion 
of men (than women) are in our field sales force and 
these roles attract higher levels of annual incentives. 
The second factor is that a larger proportion of men are 
in senior leadership roles than women. Bonus targets 
are higher for senior leadership roles and also attract 
an annual long-term incentive share grant, which is 
included in the bonus pay gap calculation.

The other driver of our median pay gap in Scotland is 
that fewer women currently occupy senior leadership 
roles. We are making progress in this area, including 
building strong, diverse talent pipelines, but due to 
low levels of voluntary turnover within our Scotland 
business, we have had limited opportunities to  
progress women into senior leadership roles.

•    Encouraging women into STEM: We are 

planning to introduce Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) female 
student internships in 2018. We are also 
introducing a scholarship programme for 
women who wish to become STEM students 
and will work to reach more part-time women 
STEM returners through work placements.
•    Beyond gender: We are also committed to 
ensuring our employee base is reflective of 
the general population, including nationality, 
ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation.

Closing the gap 

Our ambition is to close the gap. 
To achieve this, we are committed to 
delivering current and new initiatives 
to improve how we attract, engage 
and develop women, as well as other 
under-represented groups.

Flexible job design

JOB
SHARE
PORTAL

we aim to create an internal job share 
portal, allowing employees to indicate 
that they are interested in a job share  
and find potential job share partners

Flexible job design

we will continue to partner with Timewise 
with whom we run ‘flexible job design’ 
workshops

•   Leadership development: We provide training 
and mentoring for women at all stages of their 
careers to support their development as leaders. 
We are continuing our “Women and Leadership 
in Supply” programme, which in the past three 
years has reached more than 650 women across 
our business globally.

•    Maternity support: We offer coaching to 

women before, during and after maternity  
leave to retain talent in our business.

•   Flexible job design: We are proactively 

identifying roles across the business that are 
particularly suitable for part-time, job share 
and flexible job design to help break down 
barriers for applicants who do not wish to 
work full-time. We aim to create an internal job 
share portal, allowing employees to indicate 
that they are interested in a job share and find 
potential job share partners. In addition, if we 
have an employee who wants to apply for a 
role on a job share basis and they cannot find 
a job share partner internally, we will explore 
whether it is possible to find them a job share 
partner through external recruitment. In Diageo 
Great Britain, we will continue to partner with 
Timewise to ensure roles can be delivered flexibly.

•   Diversity training: In the first half of 2018, 

we will be rolling out our “Unconscious Bias 
in Talent Assessment” training in Scotland for 
hiring managers.
