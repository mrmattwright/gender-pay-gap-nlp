GENDER
PAY GAP 
REPORT
2017

published March 2018

G E N D E R   P A Y   G A P

The gender pay gap is defined as the difference in the average 
pay between men and women, regardless of the nature of their 
work.  This is different from an equal pay comparison, which 
would involve direct comparison of two people or groups of 
people carrying out the same, similar or equivalent work. 

At CHASE we are committed to fostering a culture where 
individual differences and diversity are welcomed and where 
all employees are treated and rewarded fairly, irrespective of 
gender. Monitoring our gender pay data, and more 
importantly, understanding the factors that contribute to 
differences can help us achieve that. 

The gender pay gap legislation introduced in April 2017, 
requires that UK employers with 250 employees or more on 
the snapshot date (5th April 2017) publish data about their 
gender pay gap.  In this report we are sharing the gender pay 
gap data for the 12 months to 5th April 2017.

Figure 1 shows the overall mean and median pay gap based on 
hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date.  Our overall gender 
specific pay gap shows females earning 12.6% less than men 
whereas the median is 12% lower than men. Whilst we want to 
do better, we are encouraged that these figures are both lower 
than the national average of 17.3% and 18.1% respectively. 

It also shows the Bonus pay gap - on average women were paid 
4.8% more in bonus payments than men, however the median 
was 29.6% lower.  Our bonus payments are predominantly sales 
performance related.  It is interesting to note that 20.2% of the 
women who received a bonus work in reduced time roles 
compared to only 1.9% of men.

This difference is explained by differences in gender mix by 
occupation. As mentioned previously, sales performance bonus 
accounts for the majority of the bonus payments made and we 
have 33% of women employed in non-sales related occupations 
(e.g. head office administrative roles and nursing), whereas only 
13% of men fall into this category.

Overall CHASE employs more women than men across all four quartiles, 
however we need to look at our gender balance to fully understand what 
underpins our Gender Pay Gap. Whilst men form approx. 32% of the 
work force, the split of which quartile these fall in, goes a significant way 
to explain our pay gap, with 55% of men (against 48% of women) falling 
within the Upper two quartiles.
