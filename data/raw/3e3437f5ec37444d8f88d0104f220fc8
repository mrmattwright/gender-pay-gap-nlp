is  the
The  Gender  Pay  Gap  (GPG) 
percentage difference between the hourly
rates of men and women.

1.2 GPG  is  often  confused  with  equal  pay.
Equal pay relates to the legal requirement
to pay men and women the same when
they are employed in work of equal value.

1.3

The  NASUWT  is  committed  to  eliminating
pay inequality and to ensuring that jobs of
equal  value  are  paid  equally.  The
NASUWT’s GPG figures reflect that there is
a  much  higher  representation  of  women
within the lower and lower-middle quartiles,
and a significantly higher representation of
men  in  the  upper  quartile.  There  is  no
difference in the NASUWT between the pay
of men and women carrying out the same
job.

The  NASUWT  has  an  extremely 
low
resignation  rate  of  3%,  with  many  staff
remaining  with  the  organisation  for  the
whole  of  their  careers  and  others  joining
part  way 
their  career  and
remaining  until  retirement.  Our  Stability
Index is 98% which means that 98% of the
staff  employed  12  months  ago  are  still

The NASUWT is accredited as a Real Living
Wage  Employer  and  has  ensured  staff
working in the lowest paid grades are paid
a  salary  at  least  equivalent  to  the  Real
Living Wage since 2013. The median pay of
both male and female staff is greater than
the  median  pay  of  male  and  female
employees across the UK.2

The  NASUWT  has  a  Flexible  Working  Time
policy  that  enables  staff  to  actively
balance  the  demands  of  their  personal
lives  with 
their
employment.  Over  the  last  two  years,  all
members of staff who have returned from
maternity leave have had adjustments to
their  working  patterns  where  this  was
requested.  High  levels  of  flexible  working
patterns may increase the GPG if flexible

ONS report Understanding the Gender Pay
Gap, published in January 2018, found that
the two most significant factors affecting
the  GPG  were  occupation  and  working
pattern; i.e. full-time or part-time. 

The  NASUWT’s  commitment  to  flexible
working, its extremely high retention rates
and  the  high  proportion  of  roles  within
administrative/secretarial and Conference
Centre functions all contribute significantly
to  the  Union’s  GPG.  Unlike  many  other
organisations,  the  NASUWT  continued  to

to increase the representation of women
