GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

Our founder Edwin Henry Booth had one simple aim, to sell the best food and drink 
available, in attractive stores, staffed with first class assistants. Since 1847 we have worked 
closely with local suppliers from the Northern counties we call home: Lancashire, 
Cheshire, Cumbria and Yorkshire - Booths Country. We put our customers at the heart 
of what we do and we are committed to creating a diverse workforce that represents 
the communities in which we work and serve. 
We are proud that a significant number of our colleagues commenced their first step 
into Retail at Booths and have both stayed and developed their careers with us. We 
want Booths to be a business that provides opportunities for all colleagues to fulfil their 
potential. Whilst the data contained in this report is important to understand, it is the 
actions we take as a result which will help us become an even more inclusive place to 
work that are really important.

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?
Under UK legislation that came into place in April 2017, businesses with more than 
250 employees are required to publish data about their gender pay gap by April 2018. 
This includes the details of their Gender pay and bonus gap, the percentage of men and 
women receiving a bonus and the number of men and women in each pay quartile of 
their workforce.
The Gender Pay gap is a measure of the difference in the average pay of men and 
women - irrespective of their role or level - across the entire business expressed as a 
percentage. It is distinct from ‘equal pay’ which refers to men and women being paid the 
same for carrying out the same jobs, similar jobs, or work of equal value.

HOW IS THE GENDER PAY GAP CALCULATED?
To calculate our gender pay gap we have taken the data from over *2100 colleagues for 
the 12 months to April 2017. We have then calculated the median and mean gender pay 
gap and bonus pay gap.
*Full pay relevant colleagues only

MEDIAN AND MEAN GENDER PAY GAPS
Our median and mean gender pay gaps are both lower than the UK median and mean 
pay gaps of 18.4% and 17.4%. However, there remains a differential which is strongly 
influenced by:
• The number of long serving male colleagues in senior roles
• A higher proportion of females in entry level roles where flexible
  working is more prevalent
• More females working flexibly across the business.

THE GENDER BONUS GAP
At Booths we work together to be the best we can be and when we achieve great 
results we share this success. Whilst we did not meet our criteria for all colleagues to 
receive a performance related bonus in the year of reporting, we did award a Christmas 
bonus to all eligible colleagues. The bonus is paid based on hours worked and therefore 
although more females were paid a bonus than men, the bonus gap is a reflection of the 
higher proportion of women in part time roles and less senior positions. The full value of 
the Christmas bonus was equitable across all roles and varied only due to hours worked.

PAY QUARTILES
This is the proportion of male

to quartile pay bands. The data 
below confirms that a significant 
reason for our gender pay gap 
is the higher proportion of men 
in more senior roles within the 
organisation much of which is 
driven by long service lengths.

OUR COMMITMENTS
We remain committed to creating a diverse workforce that represents the communities 
in which we work and serve. Our biggest opportunity lies in addressing the number of 
female employees in senior roles within the business and ensuring flexible working is 
accessible for our male colleagues as much as our female colleagues.

1. ATTRACTING AND SUPPORTING TALENT
We will continue to support all colleagues through providing opportunities to progress 
their career within Booths. We are proud of the progress we have made in developing 
female talent in the business in recent years so far we have:
• Increased the number of female Store Managers in the business. 
• Introduced a new Trainee Buyer programme in 2016 with our first 2 successful 
candidates both being female.
• Launched our first Talent Academy for colleagues aspiring to be Managers of the 
future of which 50% are female colleagues. This academy includes completion of 
a Level 3 Apprenticeship to further support the colleagues on this programme to 
achieve their career aspirations.
• 3 out of our 7 executive heads are now female.
Additionally we are providing more training for our supervisor population across the
business to support them to be the best they can be.

2. SUPPORTING ALL COLLEAGUES WITH THE OPPORTUNITY
  TO WORK FLEXIBLY
We aim to attract and retain great talent across our business and although we currently 
have a flexible working policy, we acknowledge that more can be done to ensure that 
all colleagues are aware of how we can support them with their requests and this 
applies to both female and male employees. 
We are confident that we can build on the solid foundations in place currently to 
become an even more inclusive place to work.
I confirm that the data contained within this report is accurate.
