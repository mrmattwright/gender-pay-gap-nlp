The phrase "gender pay gap" refers to the difference in the average earnings of men and women within the same organisation.  There is an important distinction between gender pay gap reporting, which relates to pay averages across the organisation, and the concept of "equal pay", which refers to individual male and female employees being paid equally for doing the same job at the same level.  Please see the findings of our Gender Pay Gap report.     Title  PDF    Gender Pay Gap Report 2017      For any press enquiries please contact Melanie Corrie on +44 7584 684668.
