Learn-AT is a multi-academy trust based in Market Harborough in South Leicestershire with eight member primary schools.   Learn-AT is a new charitable, school-led multi-academy trust (formed in August 2016), specialising in Church of England and community primary academies. We are building a forward-thinking, professional learning community, committed to working together in the service of local children and families. We are dedicated to the development of excellence in learning, both for our pupils and for the adults who serve and teach them. Whether they are Church of England or community academies, all of our schools promote an ethos designed to nurture the wellbeing of every child; to allow each child to love learning, to flourish and to be able to enjoy life in its fullness.  We believe wholeheartedly that flourishing and engaged pupils require and deserve flourishing and engaged adults, able to work on their behalf at the cutting edge of evidence-informed practice. For this reason we put a strong emphasis on the development of high-quality and effective professional learning for Learn-AT staff. Professionals in all aspects of our organisation, teaching and learning, care and well-being, finance and academy business management, collaborate in the pursuit of continuous improvement as they all strive to fulfil our core purpose – learning and our core value – fellowship .
