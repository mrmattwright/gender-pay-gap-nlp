This is its report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.   The mean gender pay gap is 0.3%.  The median gender pay gap is -2.8%.  The mean gender bonus gap is 71.9%.  The median gender bonus gap is 55.1%.  The proportion of male employees receiving a bonus is 51.8% and the proportion of female employees receiving a bonus is 95.9%.    Pay quartiles by gender   Band   Males   Females   Description   Lower   93.0%   7.0%   Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile   Lower   Middle   75.7%   24.3%   Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at or below the median   Upper   Middle   85.2%   14.8%   Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile   Upper   82.6%   17.4%   Includes all employees  whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile    The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  For the pay gaps, a positive percentage indicates the extent to which women earn, on average, less per hour than men and a negative percentage indicates how much women earn more per hour than men.  We have studied our gender pay gaps for salary and we welcome the affirmation of the positive work we have put into place, ensuring that there is only a slight variation in the mean gap of 0.3%. Whereas, based on the median result, women are ahead by 2.8%.  In relation to bonus payments, 95.9% of women earned a bonus compared with only 51.8% of men. However, with regards to the size of those bonus payments, men are being paid more than women. With men being paid a mean bonus payment of 71.9% more than women and a median bonus payment of 55.1%. We have determined that the main reason for the difference is that the roles that pay the larger bonuses are held by more men in the Upper Middle and Upper pay quartiles.  We do not believe that there is a gender bias in our approach to bonus pay, especially when considering that a greater proportion of women receive a bonus than men. But we recognise that the mean and median gender bonus gap will only close as a result of an increased number of women holding roles in the Upper Middle and Upper pay quartile bands.  We remain committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. We have a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). As such, we:   evaluate job roles and pay grades within a fair pay grade structure  carry out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals;  have clear processes and approvals in place for any pay reviews  provides regular anti-discrimination training for all managers and other staff members who are involved in pay reviews; and   We are committed to reporting on an annual basis.  I, Rachel Ridgill, HR Director, confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.  Signed:  Rachel Ridgill, HR Director Goodyear Dunlop Tyres UK Limited.
