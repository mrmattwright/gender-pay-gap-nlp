Diversity and Inclusion        Ensuring that our patients, their carers and our staff are treated with dignity and respect  Diversity and Inclusion Statement   East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust (EKHUFT) is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment where all our staff, patients and service users feel they can be themselves. We will ensure that no employee or person visiting our hospitals will be illegally discriminated against because of who they are.   We value the differences that a diverse workforce brings to the organisation and will build a culture that is personal, fair & diverse. It is the duty of each employee to share the responsibility of creating and maintaining an environment of teamwork, trust and respect   The principles that underpin this statement are as follows:    A workforce that is valued and whose diversity reflects the community it serves, will enable EKHUFT to deliver the best possible healthcare service.     An environment characterised by teamwork, trust and respect will enable every employee in the Trust to achieve their potential     EKHUFT views individual diversity positively and recognises that everyone is different, valuing equally the unique contribution that individual experience, knowledge and skills can bring to the organisation.    Our approach to Diversity & Inclusion is led from the very top, with the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Group members championing the agenda. The Steering group is chaired by our CEO Matthew Kershaw, attended by Executive and Divisional Directors, Trade Union and other staff network representatives and patient representatives..    Equality Objectives July 2017   1.  To support the development of leadership at all levels in a way that values and promotes equality, diversity and inclusion.   All Leadership development activity will include Diversity and Inclusion and Unconscious Bias elements.   2.  To develop the Trust's Diversity Network Groups.   East Kent Hospitals University NHS FT (EKHUFT) is proud to work with our Black Asian & Minority Ethnic (BAME) Staff Network and our Disabled Staff Council. The Chairs of the networks sit on our Diversity & Inclusion Steering Group. The Trust will turn to the networks to help with the approach to the Workforce Race and Disability Standards.  EKHUFT is keen to support the development of other network groups including LGBT+ and Women.   3.  To reduce discrimination experienced by Disabled and BME staff and applicants and Increase the percentage of BME staff in               senior positions.

Improve service delivery for those patients with a disability or from a BAME background.   We will launch the Accessible Information Standard in September 2017 and monitor the numbers of patients requesting communication support.   We will build links with Disabled and BAME groups and work with them to develop metrics for this objective.
