Barnardo’s Gender Pay Gap ReportForeword

At Barnardo’s, we believe in children regardless of their 
circumstances. Through our essential services, campaigns and 
research, we provide a voice for the most vulnerable in society. Last 
year alone, we supported more than 272,000 children, young people, 
parents and carers.

Our staff on the frontline and in support functions work tirelessly to transform the lives 
of children across the UK and we are committed to ensuring an equality of opportunity 
in the workplace, regardless of an individual’s gender, sexual orientation, gender 
reassignment, disability, age, race, religion or belief, marriage and civil partnership, 
pregnancy and maternity.

That commitment to diversity and inclusion is not just something we do at Barnardo’s –  
it is part of who and what we are.

We are also proud to be a Learning Organisation and therefore welcome the transparency 
of publishing gender pay gaps. It affords an opportunity not only to learn from our own 
data and analysis, but to share best practice from other charities and organisations. 

With 85% of our employees being female, I am encouraged that Barnardo’s gender pay gap 
of 14.07% (mean)/8.75% (median) is much better than the national average. However, we will 
not be complacent and are committed to improving on this with a determined effort.

Our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan already contains initiatives that will
support this commitment but we are also developing a specific Gender Pay Gap plan to
focus on key areas which is informed not just by the data but also internal engagement
with staff to understand the enablers and barriers to development and promotion. Initial
actions are already being implemented.

These are positive steps forward, and there is much work to do, but I am committed  
to ensuring that we do everything we can to narrow our gender pay gap.

Barnardo’s Gender Pay Gap ReportGender Pay Gap –  
What does it mean?

The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 
2017 requires Barnardo’s to carry out Gender Pay Reporting. 

This can help us to assess the levels of gender equality at the charity, the balance of male 
and female employees at different pay grades and how effective we are at nurturing and 
rewarding talent. 

The gender pay gap differs to equal pay which is unlawful. The gender pay gap is not. 
According to the Equality & Human Rights Commission, ‘…whilst both equal pay and the 
gender pay gap deal with the disparity of pay women receive in the workplace, they are two 
different issues:

1.  Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work  

 must receive equal pay, as set out in the Equality Act 2010. 

2.  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average  
 earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is expressed as a percentage  
 of men’s earnings.’1

Barnardo’s is an equal pay employer. We do not engage in any practices that breach equal 
pay legislation. 

As an employer, Barnardo’s is committed to tackling and eliminating 
gender inequality, and all forms of inequality.

These ratios are calculated from a workforce that is 85% female and 15% male; just over  
half is part-time including sessional workers. Approximately 7% of our workforce covered 
by this analysis is on different terms and conditions as the staff have been transferred  
to Barnardo’s under TUPE arrangements. We employ a large percentage of staff  
in occupations where there is a societal gender bias.

Barnardo’s workforce is predominantly female but the proportion of the male workforce 
earning in the upper quartile is higher (36.65%) than the proportion of the female work-
force earning in the upper quartile (22.84%). This is one of the key elements driving our 
gender pay gap and is therefore an area in which we are concentrating attention.

Key driver 2: Low male representation in middle quartiles
Male representation is particularly low in the upper middle and lower middle quartiles 
(18.08% and 15.63% respectively). This is another key contributor to our gender pay gap 
where we will focus attention. 

Key driver 3: Part-time and sessional work
Across employers part-time and sessional roles are more likely to be occupied by women 
than men, and the opportunities for part-time roles decrease as pay brackets increase.
Barnardo’s currently reflects this national trend. Our part-time roles are most prevalent in 
the lower quartile (73%) compared to 38% in the upper quartile. 41% of our workforce is part-
time and 13% sessional. We are committed to improving opportunities for part-time/flexible 
working within the upper quartile.
