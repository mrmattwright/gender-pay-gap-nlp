Gender Pay Gap Reporting 

 

 

 
 
From April 2017, all large UK companies employing 250 people or more are required to 
report the following pay gap figures: 
 

➢  Gender pay gap (mean and median figures) 
➢  Gender bonus gap (mean and median figures) 
➢  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisations pay structure 
➢  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses 

 
As a growing employer within the UK, Cerealto welcome this step; we believe that it is 
important for all companies to be transparent about pay and that by doing this progress will 
be made to bridge the gap that exists in the UK today.
