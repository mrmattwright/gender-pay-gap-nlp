Gender Pay Gap Report 

Merchant Taylors’ School is committed to addressing workplace barriers to equality and providing all employees with equal opportunity. 
 
The School has completed a gender pay gap audit in strict accordance with Government methodology, which identifies a mean gender pay gap of 25% 
in favour of male employees based on hourly rates of pay. Further analysis has been undertaken to identify the underlying factors. 
 
It is important to note that the gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same equivalent work. Rather, the gender 
pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the School and the salaries that these roles attract. At Merchant Taylors’ School, 
all teachers are paid on the same scale regardless of gender and all teaching and support roles are open to male and female applicants. All support staff 
roles have been subjected to independent job evaluation and are paid in accordance with the score awarded, regardless of gender. 
 
As a boys only School, a high proportion of the best paid roles have attracted male teaching staff. Nevertheless, every effort is made to attract female 
applicants for appointments on the Senior Leadership Team. 
 
In contrast to other schools, Merchant Taylors’ has retained cleaning and catering functions in-house. During independent job evaluation these roles were 
awarded scores towards the lower end of the salary scale. They are therefore paid at a lower hourly rate, yet one which remains well above the minimum 
wage. The part time hours and flexible working arrangements continue to attract a high proportion of female applicants, who provide dedicated and loyal 
service to the School in these vital support roles. Whilst outsourcing the catering and cleaning functions would reduce our mean gender pay gap to 9.3%, 
we do not feel that this would benefit our female employees or the School in any way. Our gender pay gap reflects the provision of employment to the 
local community during hours that suit the work life balance of our dedicated female employees. 
 
However, we must not be complacent and every effort will continue to be made to increase the number of female applicants for wider roles across the 
School. The gender mix of our functional teams is weighted towards females in our finance, catering and administration roles, but exclusively male in 
our maintenance, grounds and IT departments. This will be the focus of our future efforts to promote and safeguard equality of opportunity at Merchant 
Taylors’ School, which will close the pay gap over time.
