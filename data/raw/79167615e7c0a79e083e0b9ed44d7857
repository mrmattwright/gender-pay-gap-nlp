When I joined Allies and Morrison, we 
were a team of four. Today we are a 
team of 330. We have become one of 
the ten largest architectural practices 
in the country and, of those, we have 
the highest percentage of female 
qualified architects (43%).3 Of the one 
hundred largest architectural firms 
in the world, we are one of a handful 
to have a female qualified Architect 
in the top practice management 
position.4 

Over my career, the composition 
of the architectural profession has 
changed considerably and, in the 
years ahead, we confidently expect 
that more women will rise into more 
senior positions. Our own hiring 
and promotion patterns suggest a 
converging balance. At Allies and 
Morrison, we have always thrived on 
design excellence, an inclusive and 
relaxed workplace, and the opportunity 
for all who join us to shape their own 
career paths.

Managing Partner

From this year, legislation requires 
employers with 250 or more employees 
to disclose their gender pay gap 
annually. This is Allies and Morrison’s 
first annual Gender Pay Report. It 
supplements the data we are required 
to submit, providing a contextual 
understanding of our figures whilst 
restating our commitment to foster an 
inclusive workplace. 

Our calculations show that we 
have a median gender pay gap of 
10.5% and mean of 15.8%. This 
pay gap exists because we have 
a lower proportion of women than 
men in senior roles. Though this is 
a gap broadly consistent with the 
demographic within the profession, 
we are proudly committed to playing 
our part in closing it. We are an equal 
opportunities employer and all our 
men and women are paid equally for 
doing equivalent jobs. We recruit and 
promote based on individual talent and 
skills. 

We are pleased that our promotions 
over the last several years have 
become more balanced by gender. 
This reflects the broader changes in 
the composition of our profession. 
Today, more women than ever before 
are developing careers in Architecture, 
Construction and Planning. That 
wasn’t always the case. When I began 
my Part 2 in 1984, just under 17% of 
my fellow Part 2s were women.1 In the 
time period between 1979 and 2015, 
the percentage of female architecture 
students at university has increased 
from 18% to 49%.2

The numbers

Explainer
Gender pay reporting is different 
to equal pay. Equal pay deals 
with differences between men and 
women who carry the same or 
similar job or work of equal value. 
The gender pay gap illustrates 
differences in average hourly 
rates of pay between all men and 
women over a period of time in 
the workforce. 

The median pay gap is the 
difference in pay between women 
and men at the mid point of the 
pay range within the practice, 
from the lowest hourly rate of pay 
to the highest.

The mean pay gap shows the 
difference in the average hourly 
rate of pay between all women 
and men in the practice.

Figures are based on hourly pay rate as 
of 5 April 2017 and bonuses paid in the 
year 2016/17.

Bonuses  At Allies and Morrison, all 
titled staff have access to discretionary 
bonuses. Directors of the practice are 
entitled to a share of net profit.

Allies and Morrison welcomes the 
requirement to publish annual gender 
pay comparisons. It is a chance 
to reinforce our commitment to 
fostering a workplace reflective of the 
communities in which we work – 
creating opportunities to review our 
current practices and explore new 
initiatives. We are a fair employer, 
recruiting the best talent that happens 
to have achieved no less than 40% 
female balance over the last five years 
at least. Our focus in the years ahead 
will be on increasing the diversity of 
our talent pools, particularly at more 
senior levels. We recruit and train our 
people on the basis of abilities and 
qualifications and we support each 
and every member of the practice 
through mentoring, training and 
encouraging our staff to seek support, 
to build confidence and to make 
connections. 

We are proud of the diversity of our 
team. There is gender balance in 
our emerging talent group, we speak 
more than 20 languages and have our 
roots from more than 40 countries 
around the globe. We thrive on good 
communication, a collaborative 
environment and we strive to be a 
friendly workplace – one which is 
welcoming to all.

Growing access to architecture
We take a particular interest in 
expanding access to architecture, 
believing that in doing so our sector 
will attract graduates from a wider 

circle of future talent, of all genders, 
ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
This is why we work with and 
support charities that instil drawing 
and architectural skills in the next 
generation. We sponsor and actively 
participate in Dulwich Picture 
Gallery’s Southwark Schools Drawing 
Project, supporting young people in 
our home borough. Designers from 
Allies and Morrison lead workshops in 
Open City’s Architecture in Schools 
Programme, introducing to students, 
the practice of design at an early age. 
We are hosting a growing number of 
apprenticeships for those within the 
communities we work, and our annual 
bursaries support the studies of our 
own Part 2s and 3s.

How we are structured
The practice strategy and design 
leadership is set by our eighteen 
Partners. Our practice management is 
led by a management team of Partners 
and Directors chaired by the Managing 
Partner. The management team guides 
studio resources and management, 
information and communications, 
IT, health & safety, sustainability, 
training, social and cultural events. 
This work is supported by teams 
each for Administration, Finance, HR, 
Submissions and Communications, 
Graphics, Legal, Technical, Workshop, 
3D Visualisation and BIM; each of 
these teams is typically led by a 
Partner, Director or Associate Director. 
Allies and Morrison became a Limited 
Liability Partnership in 2017.
