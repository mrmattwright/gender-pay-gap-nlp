We have been taking long-term action to improve pay equality at Essex and the Government’s call for UK employers to publish their gender pay gap data gives us a chance to assess how we’re performing.  We are making progress and we have a strategy in place, but we know we need to do more. Over the last 4 years our gender pay gap, which measures the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across an organisation, has fallen by 6.2% from 24.8% in 2013 to 18.6% in 2017. Our decision to eradicate the pay gap at professorial level has contributed to this fall and also closed the pay gap at this specific pay grade. We have never had any significant pay gaps at other pay grades, but we know there are a range of different factors that contribute to our overall gender pay gap and we need to better understand those so that we can take further targeted action to address this vital issue.  Our full gender pay gap report (.pdf) outlines our strategy to further close the gender pay gap.
