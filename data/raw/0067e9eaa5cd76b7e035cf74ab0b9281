What is the gender pay gap?  Since April 5, 2017, British companies with over 250 employees are required by law to report and publish four types of figures annually.  Gender Pay Gap (mean and median average)  Gender Bonus Gap (mean and median average)  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organization’s pay structure  The Flowserve Company in scope for gender pay reporting requirements is Flowserve GB Ltd.  The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average earnings of men and women across the UK workforce. It is distinct from “equal pay”, which looks at the individual level and is about ensuring men and women are paid the same for carrying out the same work, or work of equal value. The information published is in line with reporting guidelines and looks at the hourly rates of UK employees taking into account base salary and other allowances in place at the snapshot date of April 5, 2017. It also focuses on bonus payments received in the 12 months prior to April 5.  Read more about the Flowserve GB Ltd. UK gender pay gap report.
