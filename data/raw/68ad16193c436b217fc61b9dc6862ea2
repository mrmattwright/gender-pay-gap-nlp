I N T RO D U C T I O N 
We  have  approached  the  government’s  gender  pay  gap  initiative  with 
transparency, utilising the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  In this report, we 
have published the data for our separate legal entities as well as providing 
a clear picture of our Group of companies as a whole. 

As a group of companies, we have a gender neutral approach to recruitment, 
retention, promotion and development with talent being the only criteria for 
success.  Equality and inclusion are at the heart of all that we do and we 
will continue to work with all of our employees to make improvements and 
changes where they are needed.  As Group HR and People Development 
Director for Harvey Nichols, I can confirm that the information in our Gender 
Pay Gap statement is accurate.

The Gender Pay Gap illustrates the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men and women within a 
company, expressed as a percentage.  

This differs from equal pay which examines whether men and women are awarded equal pay for equal work.

W H AT   D O   W E   N E E D   TO   R E P O RT ?

For each legal entity within the Harvey Nichols Group with 250 employees as of 5th April 2017, we must report the following 
information in relation to that snapshot date:

•  Mean gender pay gap %
•  Median gender pay gap %
•  Mean bonus gender pay gap %
•  Median bonus gender pay gap %
•  % Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment 
•  % Proportion of females receiving a bonus payment
•  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band

To provide a clear picture, in this narrative, we have reported our overall Harvey Nichols Group position, with the individual 
data for our legal entities summarised on page 4 of this report.

Pay includes basic pay, allowances such as car allowances 
and shift premium pay and is taken as a gross amount after 
any salary sacrifice.  Overtime is not included in this definition 
of pay.

The mean average involves adding up all of the hourly rates 
and dividing the result by the number of entries in the list.

A N D   M E D I A N ? 

The  median  average  involves  listing  the  hourly  rates  in 
numerical  order.    If  there  is  an  odd  number  of  results,  the 
median average is the middle number.  If there is an even 
number of results, the median will be the mean of the two 
central numbers.

As an overall group of companies, we have a negative gender pay and bonus gender pay gap.  This indicates that typically, 
or overall, our male employees have lower pay or bonuses than female employees.  This is unusual in the UK, with the mean 
gender pay gap sitting at 17.4% for 2017 and the median at 18.4%*.

We have a gender neutral approach to recruitment and retention; properly recruiting, rewarding, promoting and developing 
both men and women with talent being the only criteria for success. We have an inclusive and diverse culture, and our culture 
is supported by family friendly People Polices open to both our male and female employees in equal measure.  This approach 
has resulted in an overall population which is almost evenly split at 46% male and 54% female.  We have 60.8% female 
representation in our Upper Middle Pay Quartile and 58.7% in our Upper Pay Quartile which illustrates that as a business, we 
have strong female leadership, including a significant number of our management board.  Our lower pay quartiles as a group 
of companies represent a relatively even balance of male and female employees.

Looking at the data from our individual legal entities, we do have a mean gender pay gap of 3.2% and 7.4 % in Harvey 
Nichols Restaurants Limited (Oxo Tower) and in our Own Brand Stores respectively.  For Oxo, the pay quartiles do also show 
that we have a larger percentage of male employees in our upper pay quartile at 74.6% of the quartile.

orientation or any other protected characteristic as defined by the Equality Act 2010”
