They require employers with 250 employees or more to publish a high-level snap-shot of pay within an organisation and shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women. PIB is pleased to publish the results for the first year and to provide the accompanying report which helps to explain where we are on our journey as a new company and importantly how we will work on this important issue. The Gender Pay Gap focus comes at exactly the right time in PIB’s lifecycle since it gives us a fantastic opportunity to continue to do things differently. It also allows us to do the right thing by our people and our customers to support both our business and the wider insurance industry. In our report, we share 3 key promises: We will have a clear and transparent recruitment and internal vacancy framework which ensures the right hiring decisions are made We will provide career development opportunities for all our people at all levels across the group We will provide a Parental Toolkit which supports parents in the workplace and those returning to work PIB’s management team are committed to using the results for positive change and to providing all our people with more choice and career opportunities as our Group evolves.
