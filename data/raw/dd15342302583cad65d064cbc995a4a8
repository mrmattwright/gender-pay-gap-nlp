'Equal Pay' is about a man and a woman receiving equal pay for the same or similar job.  Proseal's gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the industry, with the senior engineers and designers in the business being male. We actively encourage and have current female engineering apprentices within the business.  We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business.  This report displays our results in the year to April 2017   Pay & Bonus Gap       Mean    Median      Hourly Fixed Pay  23%  The mean pay for men is 23% higher than that of women  15%  The median pay for men is 15% higher than that of women    Bonus Pay  53%  The mean bonus pay for men is 53% higher than that of women  *-8%  The median bonus pay for women is 8% high than that of men     The table above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017). It also captured the mean and median difference between bonuses paid to men and women at Proseal UK Ltd in the year up to 5th April i.e. any bonuses paid in December 2016 for performance in the financial year FY17.  *-ve meaning that women were higher than men       Hourly Fixed Pay    Mean  23%  The mean pay for men is 23% higher than that of women    Median  15%  The median pay for men is 15% higher than that of women          Bonus Pay    Mean  53%  The mean bonus pay for men is 53% higher than that of women    Median  *-8%  The median bonus pay for women is 8% high than that of men     The table above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017).

The variance is driven by a number of women being employed after the bonus payment date but included in the snap shot data.   Pay Quartiles           The above illustrates the gender distribution at Proseal UK Ltd across four equally sized quartiles, each containing 67 colleagues.   How Proseal is tackling its gender pay gap  While we don't have an equal pay issue for individuals carrying out the same role, we will be mindful of the pay gap which is driven by the senior team being male.  We will continue to actively encourage female applicants into our apprenticeship scheme, and hope that careers in engineering become more attractive to females to increase applicants in future years. As the business continues to grow additional support function roles will be required, these will draw applicants from less male dominated careers and could increase the female representation at senior level.  An initiative for 2018 will be to launch a mentoring programme for the 'women of Proseal' to ensure we support their career progression and aspirations.
