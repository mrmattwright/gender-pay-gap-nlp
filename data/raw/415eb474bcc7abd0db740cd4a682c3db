THE GENDER PAY GAP 
HOW WE MEASURE UP

This year, for the first time, companies with more than 250 employees 
must report on their gender pay gap. This is the difference in average 

hourly earnings between all men and all women working for an 

organisation regardless of their roles. It is different from equal pay 

which looks at men and women in the same or similar roles.

At 14%, Time Inc. UK’s median pay gap is less than 
the UK national average of 18%, but we want to 

improve and are already taking steps April 2017*

HOW WE’RE TACKLING THE GENDER PAY GAP

We believe in the right person for 
the right role and are proud to have 
female representation right up to 
executive level. 
 To promote diversity, we already 
encourage modern working. Agile 
working is increasingly popular within 

the company and supports work/life 
balance. It is also company policy to 
consider all applications for flexible 
working.
 At Time Inc. UK, we have an average 
role tenure that is above the national 
average so change will be gradual. 

 However, preliminary data for 
January 2018 shows an improvement 
in our gender pay gap and the 
gender ratios across pay quartiles.

We are committed to long-term 
change and aim to do this by:

Reviewing  

where we advertise  
in order to encourage 

a diversity of  
applicants

Reviewing the way  
we position ourselves 
 to the external market,  

and emphasising  
commitment to  

supporting an inclusive  

workplace

Developing 

career pathways 
and supporting 
development 

Advertising  

all vacancies to  
internal applicants, 
providing clear  

feedback  
to drive  

transparency

Training hiring 

managers to be aware 

of unconscious 

judgements and their 

impact  

on decision  

making 

Reviewing flexible 
working and job 
sharing policies 
with a view to 

making roles more 

accessible 

Extending our 
management 
development 
programmes to 
nurture emerging 
and established 

talent

In reporting the gender bonus gap, we can only 
include the pro-rated bonus for employees working 
part-time hours. When this is taken into account, our 
gender bonus gap falls to 19%. The structure of our 
workforce is an influence as there are more men than 
women in our upper pay quartile receiving a bonus. 

Workforce 
structure has an 
influence on the 
gender pay gap. At 
Time Inc. UK, in a 
similar way to many 
organisations, we 
have more men than 
women in our  
highest-paying  
roles.
