Our 2017 gender 
pay gap report

St Luke’s Hospice Plymouth welcomes the government’s 
initiative to improve pay equality through collecting and 
reporting gender pay data, as at April each year.

We are voluntarily disclosing our gender pay gap (cid:31) gures ahead of the legal requirement 
to do so by April 2018. 

St Luke’s (cid:31) gures have been calculated in line with the regulations set out in the gender 
pay gap reporting legislation. The calculation methodology has been checked, and I 
con(cid:31) rm that these (cid:31) gures have been veri(cid:31) ed and are accurate.

Our 2016 - 2017 Impact Report shows the distribution of male and female sta(cid:30)  across 
our organisation, and I am more than con(cid:31) dent that the pay structure we have in place 
ensures that men and women working with us are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs.

The table above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap between male and female 
employees based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date (5 April 2017). 

As St Luke’s does not pay bonuses to sta(cid:30)  and therefore there is no (cid:31) gure to report, the (cid:31) gures 
shown are the full and accurate pay gap between men and women employed by our organisation.
