FOREWORD

At Hilton, we believe a truly diverse workforce will out-think, out-innovate and 
out-perform other organisations. As a global hospitality company serving guests
in 105 countries and territories, achieving diversity is fundamental to our success, 
and we’re proud to have been recognised for our achievements as one of the top
10 workplaces both globally and in the UK, where we were named 6th Great Place
to Work in 2017.

Our commitment to building a diverse workforce starts at the very top of our 
business, with our CEO Chris Nassetta chairing the Hilton Executive Diversity 
Council. Under his leadership, our board has achieved 40% female representation, 
and we are committed to completely redressing the balance to achieve total parity 
at every level, globally.

We welcome the opportunity to highlight our existing eff orts and the programmes 
we have developed to encourage diversity. We have made signifi cant progress in 
recent years; our female talent pipeline has never been stronger, and I was delighted 
to join almost 500 female leaders from Hilton’s UK&I business at last month’s 
Women in Leadership conference – one of a number of events we’re holding 
throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. But we recognise that there is still 
work to be done to completely close the gender pay gap at every level of our 
business. This report outlines our approach to doing so.

HILTON GENDER 
PAY REPORT

WHAT IS A GENDER PAY 
GAP AND HOW IS IT 
CALCULATED?

Lowest  
Paid

The 
Median

Paid

OUR RESULTS
•  Analysis shows our gender pay gap is primarily 
driven by more men holding senior higher-paid roles, 
together with the number of part-time and flexible 
roles predominantly held by women. 
•  As a result, the current gap is not reflective of the 
gender mix in our talent pool.
•  The number of women in senior roles at Hilton has 
been increasing in recent years and our female talent 
pipeline has never been stronger. We are fully 
focused on encouraging more women into 
leadership positions to redress the balance.

Median hourly pay figures are calculated by placing 
all female or male employees in order of earnings. 
The median is the middle figure from each list. 

Mean hourly pay figures are calculated by adding all 
male or female hourly pay together and dividing by 
the total number of employees included.

The gender pay gap shows the difference between 
the average (mean or median) earnings of men  
and women. This is expressed as a percentage of 
men’s earnings.

It is important to note that the GPG  
is not the same as equal pay for equal work.  
The gender pay gap reveals the difference in hourly 
pay between men and women across the whole 
business, whilst equal pay measures what men and 
women are paid for doing work of equal value. 
Fewer women in senior positions will therefore 
result in a gender pay gap even if those women are 
being paid more than their male counterparts.

OUR FUTURE
We will only achieve and 
maintain our success by 
living our core values; 
attracting the best and 
brightest talent; and 
celebrating and leveraging 
the diversity of our  
Team Members. 

That’s why we’re focused on 
creating meaningful 
opportunities for all. 
Recruiting, supporting and 
promoting more women into 
senior leadership positions, 
removing disparity, and 
ultimately closing the pay 
gap is critical to helping our 
business thrive. 

As a result, we’re 
continuously focused on 
developing initiatives which 
promote inclusivity and 
support the development of 
all our Team Members.

THESE INCLUDE:
ENGAGING AND INSPIRING TEAM MEMBERS 

Women in Leadership Conferences: 
We’re hosting a series of annual events across the globe to inspire female Team 
Members to reach their full potential. Our UK event took place in March, with 
almost 500 corporate and hotel Team Members attending across six locations  
in the UK and Ireland to hear from inspirational internal and external keynote  
speakers and panellists. 

Women’s Team Member Resource Group: 
Sponsored by senior leaders, our resource groups promote professional growth 
through networking and development. We’ve expanded our existing WTMRG in  
the UK to focus on Team Member development through leadership panels, regular 
newsletters and networking events.

Board of Future Generations: 
Millennials are expected to make up 75% of the workplace by 2025, so we’ve created 
a Europe, Middle East & Africa “board of future generations”. These 12 millennial 
Team Members, of whom 50% are women, have been handpicked from our hotels 
and corporate offices across EMEA to help shape strategic priorities and support 
senior leadership, so our business can continue to thrive.

STRUCTURED SUPPORT AND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

PROGRAMMES AND INITIATIVES THAT PROMOTE WORKPLACE EQUALITY   

Hilton University: 
Our online learning platform provides 
extensive opportunities for Team Members 
to build their skills through a range of 
training courses. Whether they want to 
learn a foreign language, brush up on their 
writing skills or learn how to better manage 
their workload, there is a course to suit 
their needs. 

Coaching on Call: 
In 2017, we launched this new initiative
to provide more junior female Team 
Members with professional coaching.
The programme has been specially 
designed to fl ex around busy schedules, 
and provides Team Members with tailored 
support to help them achieve their goals 
during the all-important early stages of 
their career.

We’re helping female Team 
Members thrive through fl exible 
working policies and the 
opportunity to take part in 
company-sponsored sabbaticals.

Training to combat 
unconscious bias: 
We now off er bespoke online 
training courses to help combat 
unconscious bias.

Talent pool expansion:
We’re constantly striving to ensure 
that the applicant pool for senior 
roles is as diverse as possible. 

Global Team 
Members Survey: 
We conduct an annual survey of 
all Team Members across hotels 
and corporate offi  ces. Reponses 
are examined based on factors 
including gender, business 
function and region, so we can 
monitor employee satisfaction 
amongst specifi c groups 
and swiftly respond to any 
suggestions raised by our teams. 

We confi rm that this statement is accurate and is approved by Hilton’s Senior Vice President and Managing Director for 
UK & Ireland, and HR Senior Director UK & Ireland.
