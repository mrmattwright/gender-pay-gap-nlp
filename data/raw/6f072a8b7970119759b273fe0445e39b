The gender pay gap shows the difference in the hourly pay between men and women in the University. A positive percentage shows that on average men earn more than women and a negative average indicates that women earn more than men.   A gender pay gap is not a measure of unequal pay for the same or similar jobs and typically is reflective of a higher proportion of men occupying higher paid roles and a higher proportion of women occupying lower paid roles.    Equal pay is different to the gender pay gap and refers to a situation where there is a difference in pay between men and women doing the same job or work of equal value. In partnership with our recognised trades unions, UCU and Unite, the University uses the HERA job evaluation scheme to ensure that all jobs are evaluated and weighted using a standard set of criteria.                            What information must be published?  Expand / Collapse       The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, came into force on 31st March 2017, and requires employers with more than 250 employees to publish specific information on their gender pay gap.  Specifically, this means publishing 6 calculations, in relation to hourly pay, pay quartiles and bonus pay for relevant employees. More information about the specific calculations is provided below.                  What is our Gender Pay Gap?  Expand / Collapse       Mean Average  The mean average pay gap is based on the hourly rate of pay calculated in accordance with the regulations. Aston University currently has a mean average pay gap of 24.9%.  Median Average  The median gender pay gap is calculated listing the hourly pay for all relevant staff in numerical order. The median average is the middle number. Comparing the median average pay for men with the median average pay for women gives the median average pay gap. At Aston University the current median average pay gap is 25.8% .  The data shows that our pay gap is primarily the result of having significantly more men in roles in the top quartile of pay and significantly more women than men in the bottom two quartiles of pay.  Pay Quartiles  The gender split between men and women in the top quartile of roles shows that 65.1% are occupied by men and 34.9% are occupied by women.  In the upper middle quartile 52.4% of roles are occupied by men and 47.6% are occupied by women.  In the lower middle quartile men represent 38% of the group and women represent 62% . Likewise in the lowest paid quartile of roles women are over-represented with 65.2% as opposed to 34.8% of men.  Bonus Pay  Bonuses at Aston University are generally only applied to senior staff as discretionary payments linked to performance. We have fewer women employed in senior roles where a bonus would normally be paid. In addition, the calculation includes vouchers that have been issued to individual staff members through the year.  Bonus pay is calculated using payments made to employees in the 12 months prior to the snapshot date of 31 March 2017.  The percentage of men receiving a bonus was 11.5% and the percentage of women receiving a bonus was 10.4% .  The difference between the mean bonus paid to men and the mean bonus paid to women shows that on average women received bonuses 22.5% lower than men.  The difference between the median bonus paid to men and the median bonus paid to women was 0% .
