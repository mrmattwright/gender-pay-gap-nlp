2017 GENDER 

PAY GAP REPORT

2017 GENDER 

PAY GAP REPORT

Clive Fenton
Chief Executive Officer

Declaration: I confirm that the 
information and data provided in this 
report is accurate and in line with the 
UK Government’s Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017.

At McCarthy & Stone we recognise that equality in the workplace is 
good management practice and makes sound business sense. 

We  aim  to  be  an  inclusive  organisation, 
valuing  difference  and  ensuring 
that 
everyone  has  the  same  opportunities  for 
recognition, reward and career development. 

We want  everyone  to  feel  that  they  belong 
and  can  thrive  as  we  work  towards  our 
ultimate aim of Enriching Lives.
We are confident that we have equal pay at 
McCarthy & Stone and have robust processes 
to ensure this. However, we recognise that we 
have  a  gender  pay  gap which  needs  to  be 
addressed over time.

The  gender  pay  gap  can  arise  from  many 
different  factors.  Whilst  we  have  broadly 
equal numbers of male and female employees 
in the McCarthy & Stone group, the traditional 
nature  of  the  construction  industry  means 
that  there  have  historically  been  fewer 
women than men in senior, higher paid roles, 
and this is the chief reason for our gender pay 

gap. If each gender were represented equally 
by job level, our mean hourly pay gap would 
reduce  by  87%  and  our  bonus  gap  would 
disappear  altogether.  This  shows  that  our 
biggest  opportunity  to  address  the  gender 
pay  gap 
is  through  encouraging  and 
promoting female talent.

We  are  already  working  to  address  the 
gender  balance  of  our workforce. Whilst we 
are pleased with the progress we have made 
in  bringing  more  women 
senior 
management roles in the last three years, we 
recognise that there is more work to be done.

into 

We  welcome  the  requirement  to  report  our 
gender  pay  gap,  and  will  continue  to  work 
hard to attract a diverse range of employees 
and ensure an attractive working environment 
in which everyone feels a sense of belonging.

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?

Background to Gender Pay Reporting

The gender pay gap legislation requires all companies with more 
than 250 employees to report their data against six key metrics. 
 
• Mean hourly gender pay gap
• Median hourly gender pay gap
• Mean gender bonus gap
• Median gender bonus gap
• Proportion of male and female employees who 
  received a bonus
• Proportion of male and female employees in quartile 
  pay bands

McCarthy & Stone has three separate employing entities 
covered by this legislation: McCarthy & Stone Retirement 
Lifestyles Limited, which employs 935 people, McCarthy & 
Stone Management Services Limited, and YourLife 
Management Services Limited, which employ 301 and 917 
people respectively. The remaining 125 people are employed in 
other entities not covered by the legislation, for example 
McCarthy & Stone (Developments) Limited which employs most 
of our Head Office and central support functions and represents 
5.5% of the total workforce.

OUR GENDER  
PAY REPORTING

In this report we have gone a step further 
than the regulatory requirements and taken 
the opportunity to publish aggregated 
gender pay data across all group companies 
except YourLife Management Services 
Limited, whose payroll is administered by 
our joint venture partner, Somerset Care. 

We believe this approach better represents 
our wider employee population and helps us 
to understand pay and diversity across our 
organisation as a whole. Separate disclosure 
by the three entities required to report are 
detailed on the final pages of this report. 

All figures in this report relate to a snapshot 
of our business at 5 April 2017 for the pay 
gap and in the 12 months prior to that date 
for the bonus gap.

Equal pay is different 
to the Gender Pay Gap 
and it’s important to 
know the difference

Gender pay gap

The gender pay gap is the 
difference between average 
male and female pay across an 
organisation calculated in line 
with the regulations, regardless 
of the nature of work. 

Equal Pay

Equal pay means that men 
and women performing equal 
work should receive equal pay. 
This is a legal requirement.

OUR  FINDINGS

McCarthy & Stone mean and median gender pay gap

This table shows the McCarthy & Stone group mean and median hourly 
pay gaps (based on April 2017 payroll data), as well as our mean and 
median bonus gaps (based on bonus and commission data from 6 April 
2016 to 5 April 2017).

The McCarthy & Stone group covers McCarthy & Stone (Developments) 
Limited, McCarthy & Stone Management Services Limited and 
McCarthy & Stone Retirement Lifestyles Limited. This data excludes 
YourLife Management Services Limited.

Definitions 

The data shows our mean 
and median hourly pay gaps 
(based on April 2017 payroll 
data), as well as our mean 
and median bonus and 
commission data gaps 
(based on bonus data from 6 
April 2016 to 5 April 2017). 

Mean: The mean calculation 
considers basic average pay/
bonus across all of our 
employees.

Median: The median 
calculation focussing on 
those employees in the 
middle of pay/bonus ranges, 
thereby reducing the impact 
of our highest and lowest 
paid employees.

Element due to gender mix: 
This is the amount of gender 
pay gap which is due to 
there being higher numbers 
of men or women in a 
particular job role or job level.

OUR  FINDINGS

Proportion of male and female 
employees in each pay quartile

These charts show the gender makeup of the McCarthy & Stone 
group workforce in each of four salary “quartiles”. 

Quartiles are calculated by ordering the hourly rates of pay for 
each employee across the business from lowest to highest and 
splitting that list into four equal-sized groups and calculating 
the percentage of males and females in each group.

Proportion of employees receiving a bonus

Across all McCarthy & Stone group 
employees, 81.1% of men and 
77.7% of women received a bonus 
or commission payment in the 12 
months prior to April 2017. 

Not all roles are eligible for bonus 
or commission payments.

WHAT DOES OUR  
GENDER PAY GAP MEAN?

At the snapshot date in April 2017, we had 1,361 relevant employees in 
the McCarthy & Stone group*. The workforce in this group is 49.9% male 
and 50.1% female.

However, the quartile report shows that we have proportionally more 
women in the lower paid quartiles and fewer in the higher paid quartiles 
which are made up of senior managers and directors.

Our mean hourly pay gap of 34.3% and median pay gap of 37.6% for 
this population reflect the fact that we have a higher proportion of 
males in more senior roles, where pay is higher. However, if each gender 
were reported equally by job level, our mean pay gap would reduce to 
4.6% and our mean bonus gap would disappear altogether and 
become 3.9% in favour of females.

Our operating model also affects our pay and bonus gap. Unlike many 
of the major housebuilders, the majority of our site-based construction 
and trade workers, who are predominately male, are sub-contractors 
and are therefore not included in our data.

*In the same period YourLife Management Services Limited employed 917 relevant 
 employees, of whom 7.4% were male and 92.6% were female.

Group HR Director

“Our people are the life-blood of our 
organisation. We aim to attract and 
retain the best people by investing in 
their development and success, 
promoting from within whenever 
possible and creating a great place to 
work, built upon strong foundations of 
trust, honesty and inclusion. 
Together we enrich lives.”

WHAT WE ARE DOING

We are confident that our pay and bonus gaps, where 
they occur, are based on the distribution of men and 
women across the different levels of our business and 
not because of our pay policies, which are robust, fair 
and consistent.

We already have an even gender balance across the McCarthy & 
Stone group and are taking action to increase the representation of 
women at senior levels in the organisation. In the period from January 
2016 to end February 2018 the proportion of women in director level 
and senior manager roles in McCarthy & Stone group increased from 
15.3% to 19.8% and from 17.8% to 21.1% respectively. Some of our 
success stories are set out on the following pages.

In September 2017 we introduced a new management development 
programme for people stepping up to senior management, open to all 
irrespective of their gender or background. 79 of the 183 delegates so 
far have been female, representing c. 40% of the cohort from which 
they are drawn, compared with c. 30% of men in the same cohort. This 
is pleasing early progress.

We are working closely with the Home Builders Federation and other 
housebuilders to improve the image of the construction industry in 
order to attract a more diverse range of candidates. We are also 
developing our employee brand to attract more STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) candidates.

We continue to work on the introduction of more family-friendly 
policies for men and women alike as part of our emerging ‘Employee 
Voice’ programme.

SOME OF OUR 
SUCCESS STORIES

 “Since joining 
McCarthy & 
Stone as an 
apprentice in 
2015, I’ve loved 
every day of 
being on-site. I 

want to encourage more women 
to explore construction roles as 
you have such a huge sense of 
pride every time a building is 
completed. Nothing beats 
talking to our homeowners once 
they move in and realising what 
a new sense of freedom and 
independence our product has 
given them.” 

“I am proud to 
be McCarthy & 
Stone’s first 
female CFO 
and along with 
our senior 
management 

team, I am committed to 
ensuring McCarthy & Stone has 
a fair and transparent 
workplace. We are committed 
to creating a culture that values 
and champions diversity and we 
want all employees to be able 
to rise up through the 
organisation based on merit 
and fulfil their potential.”

“Ensuring we run 
our business 
with fairness, 
diversity and 
equal 
opportunity is 
critically 

important. I have a personal and 
professional responsibility to 
ensure diversity is supported and 
developed within the technology 
arena and throughout the 
organisation. At McCarthy & 
Stone we have a great platform 
to drive this inclusive, 
collaborative environment.”
