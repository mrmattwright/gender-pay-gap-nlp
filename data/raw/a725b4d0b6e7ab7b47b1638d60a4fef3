We promote equality and diversity in all aspects of teaching and learning and the curriculum as well as in the employment of staff. We are committed to ensuring that all staff are treated and rewarded fairly, irrespective of gender or any other protected characteristic. This includes, but is not limited to, age, disability, race, gender, sexual orientation, marriage, pregnancy, religious belief or gender reassignment. We will report annually on our gender pay gap, in line with specific information required under gender pay reporting legislation, and take action to eliminate or reduce any gap wherever possible.
