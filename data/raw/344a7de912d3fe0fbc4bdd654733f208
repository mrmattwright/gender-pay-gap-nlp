It’s a powerfully creative process that allows us to innovate, makes our work more satisfying, and helps us better meet the needs of our customers.                                Hiring practices  Citrix strives to find people who embody our core values. The rich and diverse environment exemplified at Citrix begins with recruiting and selecting great people. That's why our practices help us focus on the most important things. We start with efforts to attract a diverse set of candidates – people that are reflective of the makeup of our customers and communities. Our outreach efforts include attending conferences, job fairs, tech talks, community and university events.                                          Compensation and benefits  Citrix provides fair and competitive benefits and compensation programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees. Our team spans the globe, with over half our workforce located outside of the United States, and we believe it is important to be consistent in how employees are rewarded. We have differences in our programs to meet competitive needs and comply with local customs and laws, and provide offerings that reflect local market practices. Each part of our compensation program encourages and rewards both individual performance and the company’s results.                              Promoting work-life harmony  Citrix is continuously thinking in new ways about the relationship between work and our personal lives, and we believe that the future holds even more possibilities. The conversation used to be about work-life balance, where we would sacrifice either work or life (or both) to find that balance – it never really worked. The future of work is about work-life harmony. Picture this as an orchestra. All the different elements of our lives represent a different instrument and we are the conductors of our lives, creating a melody that works. At Citrix, this also means creating an environment that supports our employees through major life changes.
