The Gender Pay Gap at Tonbridge School 

 

 

 

Tonbridge School’s published pay gap headline figures are a 32.6% mean pay gap and a 
38.5% median pay gap.  These gaps are primarily due to the composition of staff in the 
School which operates  as a boys’ boarding school that directly employs its  staff  (rather 
than contracting-out important activities such as catering and cleaning, where many roles 
are part-time).  Whilst the School actively encourages female and male applicants for all 
roles at the School, it has: 
•  A high proportion of males in the large teaching population, which is the highest paid 

group in the School; 

•  A high proportion of females in the large cleaning and catering populations, which are 
the lowest paid groups in the School; very high proportions of applicants for these roles 
are female. 

 
If  classroom  teachers,  cleaners  and  caterers  are  excluded  from  the  Gender  Pay  Gap 
calculations, the mean pay gap for the other 349 staff at the School is 0.9% and the median 
pay gap is -1.7% (i.e. the median female is paid more than the median male). 
 
The School has females in a variety of senior roles (32% of the highest paid employees in 
the School are female), and is continuing in its efforts across all functions to recruit, retain 
and promote females to higher paid roles, including in teaching. 
 
The School remains committed to paying males and females who do the same job, or are 
at the same point on the relevant salary scale (where this exists), equally.

Bonus Pay Gap 

"Bonus" payments at Tonbridge School are generally discretionary payments to a small number of 
staff  at  the  TSC  involved  with  membership  sales,  and  legacy  payments  to  a  small  number  of 
Cleaners.  All staff who received bonus payments in the relevant period were female. 
 

 
 
I can confirm that the pay gap figures above are accurate.
