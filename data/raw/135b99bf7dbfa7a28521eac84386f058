Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England, said: “We know that care is far more likely to meet the needs of all the patients we’re here to serve when NHS leadership is drawn from diverse communities across the country, and when all our frontline staff are themselves free from discrimination. These new mandatory standards will help NHS organisations to achieve these important goals.”  The Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) consists of nine indicators.  Four of the indicators relate specifically to workforce data; four are based upon data from the national NHS Staff survey questions, and one considers BME representation on Boards.  The WRES aims to highlight differences between the experience and treatment of White and BME staff with a view to closing the experience gap in those metrics.  At St George’s we have been working to improve the experiences of all of our staff.  We are pleased to have made progress in a number of areas, however there is still a great deal more important work to be done.  We are committed to building on the improvements that we have made and will continue to transition these initiatives into our mainstream programmes of work.  Some of the initiatives already in progress during 2018 include:   Actively contacting all our BME staff in both non-clinical and clinical roles in band 8a+ and above to make them aware of the types of development opportunities available.  Unconscious bias training to be extended to all decision makerson Recruitment panels.  Unconscious bias modules to be included in the “Passport to Management” two day training course for all managers.  Identify a pool of Mentors/Buddies (Band 8a+) from across all disciplines and all ethnic backgrounds to support BME candidates with interview skills and techniques.  Provide training to managers to develop confidence in applying Informal strategies with all staff.  Further review of Acting-up positions to make sure they are coming to an end as planned, not longer than 6 months (except LTS/maternity) and monitor who has been selected to Act up.  Appoint a Diversity and Inclusion Manager.   WRES Action Plan 2017/18  WRES Reporting Template   Equality and Human Rights  St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has a clear vision – to provide quality health services for everyone who needs them, and to make sure that staff are competent, equal and happy in their work.  It is our aim to provide care and services that are appropriate and sensitive to all.  We always ensure that our services promote equality of opportunity, equality of access, and are non-discriminatory.  We are proud of our place in the local community and are keen to embrace the many cultures and traditions that make it so diverse.  The diversity of this community is reflected in the ethnic and cultural mix of our staff. By mirroring the diversity that surrounds us, our staff are better placed to understand and provide for the cultural and spiritual needs of patients.

The EDS is a tool that was developed by the NHS for the NHS to help it meet it public sector equality duties under the Equality Act 2010. It does not replace the core existing duties, rather it helps the Trust focus on key actions that will further embed equality within out delivery of services and in skilling up our managers to take account of equality in the decision making process. Along with the new duties under the Work Race Equality Standard (WRES), NHS organisations will be expected to show greater attention to embedding equality and human rights through all their process, systems and patient and staff experience.  Our EDS objectives for 2015-2019 which were approved by the Board are:   to prepare for the Accessible Information Standard  to develop a policy that supports patients with sensory needs  to respond to the Race Equality Workforce Standard  to support inclusive leadership at all levels.   Our performance against these objectives will be monitored by the Equality and Human Rights Committee and an annual update will be provided through the Risk and Assurance Committee to the Board.
