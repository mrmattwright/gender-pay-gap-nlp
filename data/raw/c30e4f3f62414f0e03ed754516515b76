Craven  College  employs  438  employees.  The  Gender  Pay  Gap  Reporting  Regulations 
require the College to report on aggregate employee pay data based on average and 
not individual earnings. The data covers all relevant employees  using hourly rates of pay. 
The  aim  in  publicising  the  data  is  to  ensure  that  women  are  not  disadvantaged  with 
regard to pay and that they are able to reach their full potential.

recruits 
predominantly  women  employees.    (72%  female,  28  %  male).  The  data  set  indicates  a 
mean and median gender pay gap (8.29% and 10.40% respectively). Both the mean and 
median pay gaps are roughly the same, indicating that both men and women are paid 
within the same income range.

typically 

In the Lower Quartile 1 there is a significantly larger percentage of women (83%) than for 
the other 3 quartiles.  

The Quartiles 2, 3 and 4 include a higher percentage of men (31-33%) however, women 
continue to occupy the majority of these positions (67-69%).  

The Upper Quartile 4 includes the highest paid post holder, who is a man. If this salary was 
excluded from the data, this would reduce the mean pay gap even further from 8.3% to 
5.7%.  

In the  UK  generally,  there  is  a  downward  trend  in  mean  gender  pay  gap  to  18.4%  2017 
(Office  of  National  Statistics).  The  gender  pay  gap  of  8.29%  is  significantly  lower  at  the 
College than the UK generally.  

The  College  is  fully  engaged  in  gender  equality  and  diversity.  The  College  has  a 
comprehensive  Equality  and  Diversity  policy  where  the  principles  are  fully  embedded 
within the College’s mission and vision which creates a culture of inclusiveness.
