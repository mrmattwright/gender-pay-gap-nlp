By doing that, we can develop and make changes to our services and be confident that everyone has fair and equal access to them.  We have signed up to the Chartered Institute of Housing’s Equality and Diversity Charter.  This means we are committed to the following eight principles:   Equality and diversity is driven from the top  Equality and diversity informs our business planning  Equality and diversity shapes our organisational culture  Equality and diversity is supported through staff training, development and engagement  We know who our customers are  We involve our customers in shaping and scrutinizing services  We represent the communities which we serve  We support the communities which we serve   We are a member of the Manchester LGBT housing group. This was set up to look at what happens for LGBT people in housing in the Greater Manchester area. This group has produced a guide on housing rights for LGBT people over 50 in the North West.
