We offer fair and competitive pay and benefits to all our staff. Our pay structures are transparent and 100% performance related.   All employees at Smyths Toys are afforded 100% equal pay for equal work regardless of their gender.  Gender Pay Gap Report 2017      Median (Middle)  Mean (Average)      Gender Hourly Pay Gap  0%  16%     Our analysis shows there is no median hourly pay gap.  What does this mean? If we list the pay for all men and the pay for all women in Smyths Toys UK and compare the middle value from each list there is 0% difference.  When you compare the average pay for a male to the average pay for a female (across any and all positions), the male average is 16% higher than the female average. This is driven by proportionately fewer females occupying more senior management roles. While this is low for our sector, we are working towards a reduction in this gap for 2018.  Bonus Gap       Female  Male      % of employees receiving a bonus  36%  36%           Median (Middle)  Mean (Average)      Bonus Pay Gap  48%  66%      Our bonus programme is entirely performance driven with bonus targets and payments reflecting the role, value added and responsibility of the relevant employee. There are limited management positions within the business. At present, a higher proportion of male employees occupy the senior positions which attract higher bonus targets. There are increasing numbers of female employees rising through the ranks, with the gender split and bonus % more evenly distributed at junior management level. We are actively supporting our teams so that the trending increase of female employees through the junior management ranks translates to more females occupying senior level roles.  Pay Quartiles  Our pay quartiles confirm that we have a broadly even distribution of male and female employees excepting the upper quartile / more senior roles and this is the key driver for our bonus pay gap.
