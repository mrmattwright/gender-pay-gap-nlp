WATES GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

At Wates, we welcome the UK government’s requirement for 
companies with over 250 employees to be more transparent about 
gender pay gaps. Above all, this is about people and ensuring that 
Wates is a diverse, inclusive and representative organisation.
As a company we are now required to publish four types of figures 
annually:
•  Gender pay gap (mean and median averages)
•  Gender bonus gap (mean and median average)
•  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses
• 

 Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s 
pay structure

This annual requirement will support our commitment to diversity in 
a sector with a scarcity of skills. We are focussed on attracting from 
the widest talent pool and on growing people’s careers within Wates. 
Ensuring that our workforce genuinely reflects the communities in 
which we operate is also incredibly important.

MEDIAN GENDER PAY GAP ACROSS 
ALL WATES GROUP EMPLOYEES

20.1%

This data represents the difference between the average hourly pay 
levels of all women compared with all men, irrespective of their role 
across Wates Group, expressed as a percentage of men’s average pay. 
The hourly pay figure used to calculate the difference is calculated 
according to a formula contained in the legislation.
The gender pay gap is an average figure and is not the same as equal 
pay which looks to ensure that women are paid the same for the 
same work, or for work of equal value. In Wates our gender pay gap is 
due largely to a higher proportion of women occupying lower grade 
roles as demonstrated in the table below, which sets out the gender 
distribution across Wates Group in four quartiles.

This chart shows the gender distribution across Wates Group in four 
equally-sized pay quartiles. Overall women represent 18.6% of Wates 
Group but are less well represented than this figure in the higher 
quartiles due to proportionally more men in senior roles within our 
organisation.

BONUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOMEN

55.7%

The bonus gap is largely driven by the Wates Group bonus scheme, 
which is based on percentages of base salary. Higher base salaries for 
more senior roles feed through into the bonus gap. Additionally, we 
have more women working part-time than men and, as the formula 
requires us to include actual bonuses paid, pro-rated bonuses reflecting 
actual hours worked also increases the gap.

OUR CONTEXT AND ACTIONS
While we are committed to reducing our gender pay gap we 
also recognise that our gender pay gap data is reflective of many 
organisations in the construction sector and the roles fulfilled by both 
women and men within this sector. Proportionally, there are a higher 
number of men in senior roles within our organisation which is in line 
with our sector’s trend to date. Additionally, working patterns in this 
sector make certain roles less attractive to carers of young children. 
From a societal perspective, this still affects more women than men. 
We also believe that our commitment to encourage people to develop 
their career in Wates, and our associated low turnover in certain roles, 
contributes to the on-going fact that we have a higher number of men 
in senior roles.
At 5 April 2017 our total female workforce was 18.6%, a figure we want 
to improve. We are actively encouraging more people, particularly 
women, to consider careers in the construction industry through an 
emphasis on early careers including ensuring our presence at career 
fairs across the UK. Building visibility of female talent within the 
construction sector is also crucial and we play our part in that by 
regularly nominating our female leaders for industry awards.
Our work continues to ensure our apprenticeships are attractive to 
women, as well as constantly looking at how our reward structure is 
set up to attract the most diverse workforce. All of this is underpinned 
by a broader focus on diversity and inclusion at Wates. Our Diversity 
& Inclusion Committee will help Wates to deliver a refreshed D&I 
strategy over the coming years.
