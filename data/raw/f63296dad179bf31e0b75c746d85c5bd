Foreword 

This report provides an update on activities related to diversity 
and inclusion activities over the period from 1 April 2016 to 31 
March 2017. This period spans the expiration of our previous 
equality scheme and the development of the Assembly 
Commission’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for the Fifth 
Assembly. 

This year has seen teams working collaboratively to realise our goals to further 
develop our workplace equality networks, build capacity across our organisation to 
undertake equality impact assessments, continue to take steps to address 
underrepresentation in our workforce and endeavour to engage the broadest 
range of people in the work of the Assembly. 

Looking ahead, we will focus on delivery on our objectives set out in our Diversity 
Plan for the Fifth Assembly. Our areas of focus include fostering inclusive 
leadership and an inclusive workplace culture, assisting our staff, Assembly 
Members and their staff to build diversity and inclusion into their work and 
behaving as an inclusive employer that attracts and retains a broad range of 
talent.  

As ever, we welcome feedback on our approach to the way in which we value 
diversity and further inclusion in our organisation and look forward to continuing 
progress in reaching our goals set out in our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.

1. Engaging with the People of Wales and 
Widening Public Engagement 

One of the strategic goals of the Assembly Commission is to 
engage with all of the people of Wales and to champion the 
work of the Assembly. It is important that the Assembly 
represents all of the people of Wales and that everyone has 
access to our work, our buildings and our information.  

During this reporting period, we have developed a new Public Engagement 
Strategy that will inform our priorities for public engagement. The purpose of the 
new strategy will be to plan the delivery of services that connect and engage with 
all the people of Wales, by informing and involving all the people of Wales in the 
Assembly’s work, and introduce ways that empower them as citizens to directly 
influence and take pride in the parliament’s work. Particular attention will be 
given to developing services that engage those who do not currently engage with 
the Assembly. 

Major public engagement initiatives 

In November 2016, we announced: 

 

the establishment of a Youth Parliament for Wales, supported and 
funded by the Assembly Commission; and 

 

the establishment of a Digital Information and News Task Force. 

Overview of community and youth engagement 

In the last year, we have welcomed thousands of visitors to our estate and 
interacted with people across Wales in a variety of different ways. Below we 
celebrate some of our engagement work and share some of the highlights of the 
year.

CASE STUDY: #SeneddNewport 

 

Building on the success of our visits to Wrexham and Swansea, we took the 
work of the Assembly to Newport for a week in March 2017. The week’s activities 
were delivered in partnership with the South Wales Argus and the University of 
South Wales. During a busy week, three committees held formal meetings in 
the Newport campus of the University of South Wales; two of our committees 
visited local schools; our outreach, youth engagement and education teams 
delivered 30 information sessions; the Llywydd held a reception for local 
organisations and individuals; and we took a public engagement stall to the 
Friar’s Walk Shopping Centre.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

As part of this week, the Deputy Presiding Officer, Ann Jones AM, had a series of 
meetings with key local stakeholders to discuss how the Assembly connects 
with women. The Deputy Presiding Officer’s meetings focused on improving 
how the Assembly engages with women who may feel disempowered and 
disengaged. Over the course of an afternoon, the Deputy Presiding Officer met 
with women in refuge at Women’s Aid Newport, refugee women at the Welsh 
Refugee Council and members of staff at SEWREC. The Deputy Presiding Officer 
fed back her findings from these meetings to the local Assembly Members and 
the relevant Cabinet Secretaries.  

During this event, we engaged directly with over 1,900 individuals and 
established links with numerous schools, youth groups and other organisations. 

Understanding and engaging sessions 

Our Outreach Team held fifty-three “Understanding and Engaging” sessions for 
1,076 delegates over this year, involving a range of groups, including the British 
Deaf Association, Action on Hearing Loss, Citizens’ Advice Bureau staff and 
volunteers, Evangelical Alliance Wales and Gingerbread. These session introduced 
attendees who might not have necessarily interacted with the Assembly before, to 
what the Assembly does, outlining the election of Assembly Members and who 
their representatives are, how to hold the Welsh Government to account and how 
they can engage with Members and the work of the Assembly. 

Education and youth engagement 

Our Education and Youth Engagement team have informed, involved and 
empowered children and young people to engage with Assembly Business both 
in our in-house education centre and at schools, colleges and out of school 
settings across Wales.  

We have worked with 151 youth groups   in out-of-schools settings, engaging with 
some groups for the very first time, including 3G's Development Trust, ACT Training 
- Aberdare Centre, Afasic Cymru – Neath, Barnados Young Carers Flintshire, 
Blaenau Gwent Youth Forum, Ceredigion Youth Service, Cwmbran Centre for 
Young People, Deffo!, Digartref Ynys Môn - Community Voice, Newport YMCA, 
Newport Info Shop, Omidaze Productions, Pembrokeshire Voices for Choices, RCT 
Community Youth Forum, Swansea Young Single Homeless Project – SYSHP, The 
Point Young Persons , TrustVale People First, Whizz Kids - Conwy.  

During this reporting period, a total of 653 sessions and events have been 
delivered, reaching over 27,000 young people.

CASE STUDY: Digartref Ynys Môn 

A group of ten young people, supported by homelessness charity Digartref on 
Ynys Môn have been working with our outreach team as a part of their 
Community Voice project. As part of the project the group, aged between 16-25 
years old, took part in a Wales 2016 election workshop, held a mock election, 
attended the polling station on Election Day and took part in two full workshops 
at the Assembly in Cardiff. 

 

 

CASE STUDY:  Black History Month 

In October 2016 young people from Grangetown and Butetown Youth Pavilion 
visited the Assembly and spent time asking questions to the Llywydd as part of 
Black History Month.

Promoting diversity and inclusion  

As part of our commitment to being an inclusive organisation we continue to 
promote diversity and inclusion to our staff and to the public via events, social 
media and campaigns.  

We have continued to use social media to reach a wider audience, promoting a 
diverse range of campaigns and key dates in the diversity and inclusion calendar, 
including Stonewall’s No Bystanders anti-bullying campaign during Anti-bullying 
week; our Diversity and Inclusion week; LGBT History Month; Holocaust memorial 
Day; Black History Month; Disability Access Day; World Autism Awareness Day; 
celebrating external recognition that we have received; a campaign to end 
violence against women; Pride Cymru; Trans Day of Visibility; youth engagement; 
and Swansea Sparkle. 

We have encouraged people to think of the Assembly as an inclusive organisation, 
encouraging them to get involved with the work of the Assembly and to consider 
the Assembly as a potential employer of choice. 

Here are some of the highlights of our promotional work: 

  We attend Pride Cymru every year, as part of our summer events 

programme. In 2016, we were proud to march alongside many other 
organisations and individuals as part of the official Pride parade before 
welcoming attendees to our outreach bus on the main site. 

 

 

Alongside other iconic buildings across the world, the Senedd was lit 
purple on 8 March to mark International Women’s Day 2017. We also 
delivered an event in partnership with Wales and West Cross 
Government Women’s Network, which delivered a series of ‘power talks’, 
a lunchtime reception and networking fayre and an evening drinks 
reception in the Senedd. The event involved up to one hundred and fifty 
women. 

Rhondda and Pontyclun Hard of Hearing Groups, Sense Cymru and 
service users from the National Autistic Society Cymru were invited to 
visit the Senedd over the weekend of Disabled Access Day to celebrate 
the Assembly as a welcoming and accessible venue for all.

 

The Llywydd Elin Jones AM, Joyce Watson AM Assembly Commissioner 
with responsibility for equality and Andrew White, Director of Stonewall 
Cymru, promoted ‘By Your Side’, Stonewall’s campaign asking LGBT 
advocates and allies to pledge their commitment to continuing to work 
towards LGBT inclusion.  

  We celebrated Black History Month in October by holding a series of 

events within the Assembly, attended community events and wrote blog 
articles in order to promote engagement with the Assembly to BME 
people.

Visitor attraction  

The Assembly estate continues to be a popular visitor attraction. During this 
reporting period, we welcomed nearly 83,680 visitors to the Senedd and nearly 
82,962 people to the Pierhead Building. People have visited from all over the 
world to enjoy our buildings, to watch Assembly Business, have a tour, attend an 
event or to visit our café and shop. We are listed on TripAdvisor as one of the top 
visitor attractions in Cardiff and we are proud to have received their Certificate of 
Excellence.  

We promote the Assembly as a visitor attraction through connections with the 
local Cardiff Bay Waterfront Partners Group, through social media, through our 
outreach work and through Euan’s Guide, a listings and review website that helps 
disabled people and their families know which venues are accessible.

Feedback from visitors, which included a group of asylum seekers and 
refugees and a group of disabled children and young people: 

  As a group that suffer hearing loss it's not always easy when we visit 

places, you made us feel so welcome and thanks to the equipment 
provided, we were all able to hear. A BIG thank you from all the group, 
we hope to visit again in the near future. 

  Many, many thanks. Our tour guide was brilliant, pitched it perfectly, 

engaged everyone and was spot on with timing. Very impressive. They 
loved it! 

  Service received was “over and beyond the call of duty 

  our tour guide was great. He used appropriate content and speed in 

his delivery. However right from the security check at the entrance, all 
members of staff were great. 

 

 

 

 

  We visited with a group of young people, all with additional needs. 

Accessibility is fantastic, and our tour guide was excellent. Thank you 
for this opportunity.

CASE STUDY: Senedd Family Fun Day 

 

Over the August bank holiday weekend 2016, we hosted Senedd Summer Fun, 
a free event for people of all ages to enjoy. During the event we had a soft play 
area, Lego station, arts and crafts, choirs singing, Techniquest offering fun 
scientific games and activities, there were tours of the building running every 30 
minutes, and discussing the work of the Assembly. We also commissioned a 
local community art group to create an exhibition to be shown in the Senedd 
for the duration of the event; the exhibition focussed on Wales, Welsh culture, 
history and what it is like to live in Wales today. There were 3,500 attendees over 
the three days which saw us attract local families to the Assembly who might 
have not ordinarily visited our buildings.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Online Accessibility 

Following an accessibility audit of our website, we have made a number of 
accessibility improvements that are aimed at improving the overall transparency 
of our website information. These changes include: 

 

 

 

redesigning the homepage and top-level pages to display the types of 
information users access on a regular basis; 

creating a new ‘mega-menu’ to allow users to navigate more quickly to 
other items of interest; and 

changes to Assembly Member biography pages to make it easier to 
access their plenary speeches and how they’ve voted.   

In addition to this, our Digital Team has worked closely with our website 
publishers to raise and maintain standards in relation to website publishing, 
which is a vital component of trying to maintain standards.  

MySenedd – making improvements to the way that we work 

The MySenedd programme is a series of projects designed to improve the way we 
manage and use information, deliver services to Members and interact with all our 
users through the use of technology. The programme aims to create a truly 
outstanding, open, digital parliament.   

When designing elements of the Programme, we completed equality impact 
assessments as part of the formative stage, the outcomes of which are integral to 
the development and decision making process, ensuring that our design solutions 
take account of a diverse range of needs.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

CASE STUDY – Rich Picture – inclusive communications 

 

We engaged a Royal National Institute for Blind People (RNIB) trained local 
design company (Scarlet Design) who have specific diversity and inclusion 
expertise, to articulate our future vision of the MySenedd programme in an 
engaging, informative and easy to understand way. As part of the brief the ‘Rich 
Picture’ would consist of a mixture of words and pictures and be available in 
Welsh and English. 

The finished pictures depict Assembly staff, Assembly Members and the ‘People 
of Wales’. They reflect the diversity of our staff and service users, and the high 
importance we attach to meeting our equalities duties when redesigning our 
services.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Accessible estate  

We continually review the accessibility of our estate, undertaking monthly 
maintenance audits, as well as acting on feedback and adopting best practice. 
During this reporting period, we have undertaken further work to improve the 
physical accessibility of our estate, including:  

  widening the access ramp in the underground car park at the main 

atrium stairwell/ lift lobby; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

installing ramped access to the new sound/ translation booths for the 
new committee rooms;  

installing new signage, including braille, to new committee rooms and 
meeting rooms; 

providing a new quiet room on the ground floor; 

installing new signage, including braille, following lift refurbishment; 

installing new signage, including braille, in all shared toilet and shower 
room facilities throughout the estate; 

considering access requirements for all refurbishment work that been 
carried out; 

continuing with the programme of installing LED lighting to improve 
visibility in the Senedd and other areas across the estate; and 

reallocating some toilet and shower facilities as ‘gender neutral’ or 
‘gender neutral and accessible’. 

FEEDBACK - “Fabulous! Love the gender neutral loo!” 

Learning and improving – name change consultation 

Between 8 December 2016 and 3 March 2017, the Assembly Commission ran a 
public consultation on changing the name of the National Assembly for Wales. 
Respondents were asked to provide equality monitoring data to help the 
Commission to assess the representativeness of the sample. Following feedback 
from members of the public, we identified a need to learn and improve from this 
and subsequently reviewed our methodology for gathering equality monitoring 
data and identified best practice to inform future initiatives. 

14 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Going forward: 

We will evaluate relevant data and use best practice to inform how we continue to 
build diversity and inclusion into: 

 

 

 

 

 

developing an inclusive and effective youth parliament; 

promoting access to our information and our estate;  

promoting diversity and inclusion as an employer and parliamentary 
organisation; 

implementing our Public Engagement Strategy which  will ensure that 
we continue to engage with a diverse range of people across Wales and 
people who have not engaged with the Assembly before; and 

implementing the MySenedd programme to identify and implement 
technological improvements to increase our engagement opportunities.

2. Supporting our Workforce: the Assembly 
Commission as an Employer of Choice 

We strive to be an inclusive employer of choice where all of 
our staff can thrive in a safe and supported environment.  

Our workforce and recruitment data, and an equal pay audit 
can be seen in Annexes A and B respectively.   

Arrangements to support Commission staff 

We have a number of policies and initiatives in place to support our staff and help 
us promote equality, foster good relations and remove discrimination. These 
include:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dedicated teams and workplace equality networks that provide a range 
of advice and support; 

a variety of flexible working arrangements that enable staff to find a 
working pattern that suits their needs;  

using our workplace equality networks to impact assess our policies to 
ensure they are fair and inclusive; 

an Employee Assistance Programme that offers a counselling and advice 
service to staff; 

health and wellbeing policies in place which include a mental health 
policy and policy for supporting staff who are experiencing domestic 
abuse. Such policies are supplemented by ongoing awareness 
campaigns that highlight how staff can access both peer support and an 
on-site occupational health nurse; 

annual Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessments and reasonable 
adjustments for those that need them; 

an annual Diversity and Inclusion Week to raise awareness of different 
equality issues and promote the support available to staff; and 

regular awareness-raising initiatives on equality–related themes to 
inform staff and Assembly Members, including factsheets, training and a 

16 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

monthly Diversity and Inclusion Bulletin that lists relevant news, 
publications and consultations. 

Apprenticeship scheme  

 

Following the previous successes of our apprentice scheme, we welcomed four 
new apprentices in September 2016. Working towards their Business and 
Administration diploma, they are the first cohort of apprentices to experience the 
rotational programme on offer at the Assembly. They will experience five months 
in different teams to fully enhance their experience whilst working here. Our 
apprentices are paid in line with the accredited Living Wage scheme, which is 
higher than the usual apprentice rate.  

The apprentices have already proved to be assets to their teams, assisting on 
projects as well as outreach work at career events across Cardiff promoting 
apprenticeships. They have also undertaken fundraising events at the Assembly 
and will shadow Assembly Members later in 2017.   

Our apprenticeship programme provides work-based learning for young people, 
but also presents them with life changing skills and experiences. We see their 
confidence grow and their strengths highlighted in a new environment. One 
apprentice has positively progressed his volunteering work outside of the 

17 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Assembly since working here, participating in talks at Westminster and Poland 
and working with representatives from Greece, Estonia, Poland and Syria. We now 
look forward to initiating the process to recruit our next intake of apprentices for 
the future.  

Mental health in the workplace 

During this reporting period, our wellbeing strategy concentrated on mental 
wellbeing and included the delivery of a Mental Health Awareness Week. During 
the week: 

 

the Assembly Commission signed up to the Time to Change Wales 
pledge to end mental health stigma;  

  we launched our mental health policy that had been designed with the 

assistance of a group of staff who have experienced mental ill health; 

  we introduced a member of the Management Board as our Mental 

Health Champion;  

  we held Time to Change talks, where staff were able to hear directly 

from people who had experienced mental ill health; and 

  we delivered mental health awareness training to staff.  

Flexible working  

We have a range of flexible working options for staff. During National Work Life 
Balance week, which is an annual campaign to encourage employers and 
employees to focus on wellbeing at work, our flexible working options and the 
support that we have in place were promoted to staff. These policies have resulted 
in us being named as one of the best family-friendly places to work in the UK by 
Working Families. We were the only Welsh organisation named in the Top 10 
Employers Working Families Awards and, as such, we are proud to be an exemplar 
employer to other organisations in Wales.  

External recognition  

During this reporting period, we were proud to receive new or ongoing external 
recognition for our diversity and inclusion activities, which include: 

 

being ranked fifth in Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index 2017, ranked 
the top public sector employer in the UK and named the Top Public 
Sector organisation in Wales for the fourth year running. Ross Davies, our 

18 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Diversity and Inclusion Manager, was also named Stonewall Cymru’s Ally 
of the Year;  

 

 

 

retaining our National Autistic Society Award for being an autism-
friendly employer and service provider; 

being listed as a top 10 family friendly employer in the UK by Working 
Families Organisation; 

being designated as a Disability Confident Employer and Age Positive 
Employer; 

  winning an Action on Hearing Loss Cymru Excellence Award for our 

service to people who are deaf or have a hearing loss;  

 

retaining the Investors in People Gold Standard, the international mark 
of global excellence. Organisations that meet the world-recognised 
standard reflect the very best in people management and our 
achievement of the gold award demonstrates our continuing aim of 
being an employer of first choice; and 

  we were reassessed by Action on Hearing Loss for their Louder than 

Words Charter Mark and are awaiting the decision. 

 

 

19 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Workplace equality networks 

Our workplace equality networks help us to promote inclusion internally and 
externally by taking forward diversity campaigns, providing peer support, sharing 
best practice and by helping the Assembly Commission to consider equality, 
diversity and inclusion in our work.  

Following a membership drive as part of our Diversity and Inclusion Week 2016, 
we saw the number of members and allies increase.  

Our staff network co-ordinator has supported the networks to collaborate and to 
contribute to equality impact assessments undertaken by Assembly Commission 
staff. We currently have senior diversity champions for race, sexual orientation and 
gender identity, gender, working families and mental health. We hope to secure a 
senior champion for disability in the next reporting period.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

CASE STUDY: Black History Month  

For Black History Month (BHM) in October, we had a range of activities to help 
promote race equality: 

 

  Our Race, Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage (REACH) workplace 

network promoted the concept of unconscious bias and provided 
tips to staff on how to recognise and address biases. 

  We held a panel talk to acknowledge World Mental Health Day 

(WMHD), which fell on the 10 October, where people from various 
protected characteristics discussed the mental health issues faced 
by them or within their communities, including the Black Minority 
Ethnic (BME) community. 

 

A BME Youth Engagement Question and Answer Session was held 
with the Llywydd, Elin Jones AM. 

  We attended BHM community events to promote the Assembly as 

an inclusive organisation and employer of choice; and 

 

published a suite of tweets and blog articles related to BHM.  

 

 

21 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Underrepresentation in our workforce 

We have continued to develop an approach to address the underrepresentation of 
people who identify as Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) or disabled in our 
workforce. This work is building upon our existing BME action plan to support and 
develop our current BME colleagues and also to attract and recruit people from 
the widest pool of talent, so that our workforce is reflective of the population it 
serves. Scoping work has taken place in this reporting period for developing tools 
for staff in managing unconscious bias and reviewing our methods for attraction 
and selection.  

Our workplace networks play a vital role in helping us to take forward this agenda. 

Members of our Diversity and Inclusion Team are part of the Black, Asian or 
Minority Ethnic (BAME) BAME Challenge, established by the Speaker of the House 
of Commons, to refocus energy and commitment in UK workforces to ensure that 
businesses attract, recruit, retain and develop BAME colleagues to help them 
reach their potential. A report from the BAME challenge will be published later in 
2017.  

Learning and development opportunities 

In addition to our mandatory induction training and online equality learning, we 
continue to offer a suite of learning and development opportunities to 
Commission staff.  

 

 

22 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

CASE STUDY: Diversity and Inclusion Week 2016 

 

As part of our annual Diversity and Inclusion Week we raised awareness of a 
number of issues and promoted the Assembly as an inclusive organisation. This 
year was especially busy. We provided training on disability confidence, 
dementia awareness, supporting LGBT colleagues and an introduction to deaf 
awareness and British Sign Language. Our BME and women’s workplace 
networks invited guest speaker Betty Campbell MBE to talk about her career as 
the first Black head teacher in Wales. 

In our internal and external communications we covered a range of issues, 
including unconscious bias, inclusive staff policies, human rights in Wales, 
equality impact assessments, invisible disabilities, text relay telephone service, 
promoted our BME workplace champion and promoted our workplace equality 
networks. We had a great response from staff and a lot of engagement with our 
social media outputs.  

 

 

23 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Going forward: 

We will evaluate relevant data and use best practice to inform how we continue to 

build diversity and inclusion into: 

 

 

 

 

 

supporting and developing our workplace equality networks and senior 
diversity champions; 

identifying and acting on opportunities to promote the Assembly as an 
employer of choice to potential employees, including creating 
opportunities for disabled people and BME people to undertake work 
experience placements within the Assembly; 

further developing our approach to recruitment and attraction to 
encourage more people to consider the Assembly as an employer of 
choice, including updating our website and undertaking recruitment 
outreach activities; 

participating in relevant benchmarking and accreditation activities to 
ensure that we remain and inclusive employer and service provider; and 

promoting equality, diversity and inclusion to our staff through training, 
events and sharing information to further their understanding of the 
different needs and experiences of their colleagues, visitors and service 
users.

Caseworker training, highlighting issues affecting disadvantaged groups. 

Equality and access fund 

The Equality and Access fund is used by Assembly Members to engage with their 
constituents and to provide reasonable adjustments for Members and their staff. 
During this reporting period, the fund was used in a variety of ways, ranging from 

25 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

providing translation facilities at meetings with constituents to improving access 
to Members’ constituency offices. On several occasions, the fund has been used by 
Members for British Sign Language interpretation, to communicate with 
constituents at meetings and events hosted by Members. The fund has been used 
by Members in to improve access, including: translation of correspondence into 
Braille to engage with a blind constituent and installation of a ramp to ensure 
wheelchair access to a constituency office. 

CASE STUDY: Assembly engagement in community languages 

One Member used the Equality and Access Fund to engage with members of 
the Chinese community within their region. They identified the need to ensure 
information is readily available in the language their constituents find most 
accessible. They requested to produce and translate an existing Welsh and 
English bilingual document into Mandarin, enabling information to be 
communicated to constituents whose first language is Mandarin.  

Information, guidance and awareness-raising 

Our teams across the Assembly provide specialist advice and guidance to 
Assembly Members by: 

 

 

 

 

providing employment, recruitment and management advice to 
Members; 

building equality considerations into briefings and research provided to 
Members and committees; 

providing a suite of diversity information on our internal intranet, 
including Members’ obligations under the Equality Act 2010; 

ensuring Members and their staff can participate in our workplace 
networks and diversity and inclusion awareness-raising initiatives; and 

  making health and safety support and Personal Emergency Evacuations 

Plans available.

Engagement with the work of committees 

We continue to utilise innovative methods of engaging with people in the work of 
the Assembly, including applications such as Dialog and Loomio to promote 
online conversations with a diverse range of communities across Wales. 

We look at different ways that people can submit evidence and when inviting 
people to submit evidence for committee inquiries, we provide guidance on how 
they can make their written submissions more accessible. 

CASE STUDY: Focus groups with young people with additional learning 
needs 

In scrutinising the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) 
Bill, the Children, Young People and Education Committee partnered with 
SNAP Cymru and Children in Wales to directly involve young people in the 
Stage 1 scrutiny of the Bill.  

Committee Members attended workshops with young people with additional 
learning needs to gather their views. In addition to the workshops, a survey was 
promoted to enable a wider number of young people to have their say on some 
of the issues the Bill sought to address: the current level of support they receive, 
who should be entitled to support and where they felt they should receive 
information and support from. 

The groups included Afasic Cymru in North and South Wales, Dynamic 
Wrexham, Bridgend College, EOTAS group, Ysgol y Gogarth, Coleg Sir Gar, Vale 
People First, Ysgol Uwchradd Aberteifi, CAVC, Heronsbridge School, Bridgend 
and St Christopher’s School.  

The contributions made by young people helped the Committee in its 
deliberations and informed the recommendations it made in its report.

CASE STUDY: Empowering young people to submit a petition  

Our Youth Engagement and Education team have worked with different groups 
of young people from the Whizz Kidz charity in North, Mid and South Wales. 
One of the groups worked with the team to develop a video, which they 
submitted as evidence in front of the Petitions Committee. 

 

 

CASE STUDY: Support available for refugees and asylum seekers 

As part of the Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee 
summer consultation on its forward work programme, the support available for 
refugees and asylum seekers in Wales was a top priority for its stakeholders.  

Members went out to visit support groups in the Newport, Swansea and Cardiff 
areas: three of the largest Home Office Dispersal Areas in Wales. The purpose of 
these visits was to speak directly with refugees and asylum seekers and those 
who support them, to understand what the main problems are for refugees and 
asylum seekers, particularly around access to health services, housing, education 
and employment.  

 

28 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

The Committee used the information gathered to help form the questions they 
went on to ask organisations and the Welsh Government during scrutiny 
sessions. The contributions of refugees and asylum seekers was referenced in 
the Committee’s report, which has instigated a positive engagement between 
the provider of asylum accommodation in Wales and organisations who support 
asylum seekers to address the serious concerns raised about the quality of 
housing available to refugees and asylum seekers.  

 

Case Study: Human Rights scrutiny – lessons learnt from the Public Health 
(Wales) Bill 

When the Public Health (Wales) Bill was introduced, an issue arose around 
human rights. The Bill, as introduced, would have restricted the right to smoke 
tobacco cigarettes and use e-cigarettes in a home that was also a workplace. 
However, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the 
right to respect for the home (including the right to do what you want in your 
own home). Therefore, there was a potential conflict between (a) the state 
restricting the right to smoke tobacco cigarettes and use e-cigarettes in the 
home, and (b) the right to do what you want in your own home. 

To ensure that the Assembly carefully considered human rights, our teams: 

 

 

 

briefed the Committee on the importance of carefully and properly 
considering the issues; 

identified expert witnesses who formed a focused evidence session; 
and 

prepared focused questions for the Committee to ask those 
witnesses.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

CASE STUDY: Taking evidence from witnesses with dementia 

On 9 March 2017, six people living with dementia gave evidence to the Health, 
Social Care and Sport Committee. Three of those attending were diagnosed 
with dementia, two of those having a diagnosis of early on-set dementia. The 
other three witnesses were carers of people with dementia.  

Advance preparation was key to the success of the session. We:  

 

 

 

 

ensured that the witnesses had a full understanding of the 
implications of giving evidence on the record; 

arranged for them to visit the committee room in advance. We 
trialled the translation equipment and explained how the session 
would run; who would be in the room; explained there may be 
noise from people coming in and out of the public gallery; 

gave them a table plan of where everyone would be sitting and an 
A4 sheet with photographs of all the Assembly Members who 
would be present; and 

enabled them to feel comfortable when contributing by allowing 
the witnesses to use cards to show when they wanted to contribute 
during the meeting, a process that they are familiar with from their 
support group meetings. 

 

At the end of the meeting, several of the witnesses took up the offer to take part 
in a tour of the Senedd. They also offered to work with relevant Assembly staff to 
produce a guide to visiting the Assembly for people with dementia.

Research service 

The Research Service continued to embed the principles of equality, diversity and 
inclusion into all areas of its work during this reporting period, including individual 
Members’ enquiries, committee work and proactive publications, such as blog 
articles.  

Some achievements include: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developing a set of Welsh gender equality indicators based on the best 
available statistical evidence to help Members scrutinise policies, 
legislation and budgets from a gender perspective; this was published 
to tie into the Assembly’s debate on International Women’s Day; 

undertaking an informal review of the Assembly’s progress towards 
being a gender-sensitive parliament against the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union action plan, which included a suite of practical recommendations 
for senior staff; 

providing suggested questions for each committee on equality during 
the draft budget scrutiny; 

publishing a range of blog posts on equality issues, such as violence 
against women, gender equality, human rights, equality and human 
rights, poverty and inequality, older people, hate crime, political 
representation and children’s rights; 

ensuring equality is integrated in the drafting of suggested terms of 
reference for committee inquiries (for example, the Economy, 
Infrastructure and Skills Committee economic strategy work; the 
Children, Young People and Education Committee’s inquiry into the 
education improvement grant; the Health, Social Care and Sport 
Committee’s inquiry into loneliness and isolation and the Equality, Local 
Government and Communities Committee’s inquiries into the Violence 
Against Women Act, refugees and asylum seekers and poverty); and 

providing expert advice and research on equality issues to the 
independent Remuneration Board and the Electoral Reform Expert 
Panel.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Going forward: 

We will evaluate relevant data and use best practice to inform how we continue to 
build diversity and inclusion into: 

 

 

ensuring that Assembly Members and their staff have the support, 
advice, information and training that they require to function as inclusive 
employers, colleagues, elected representatives and service providers; and 

promoting our workplace equality networks to Members and their staff 
to further embed our commitment to being an inclusive organisation.

4. Embedding Equality into our Work 

New diversity and inclusion strategy for the Fifth Assembly 

The Assembly Commission agreed our new Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for the 
Fifth Assembly in December 2016. The Strategy sets out our approach for 
delivering our diversity and inclusion objectives over the course of the Fifth 
Assembly and is accompanied by an action plan for delivery. The Strategy builds 
on progress from our previous Equality Plan, further integrating diversity and 
inclusion into the day-to-day running of the Assembly and sets out how we intend 
to meet our statutory obligations in relation to equality. 

Building diversity and inclusion and equality into our work 

There has an increase in the number of equality impact assessments undertaken 
over the reporting period. Over this reporting period, assessments that have been 
initiated include: 

 

several accommodation refurbishment projects on the estate; 

  MySenedd programme; 

 

 

 

 

 

Staff Mental Health Policy; 

potential name change of the Assembly;  

Youth Parliament project; 

Public Engagement Strategy; 

Diversity and Inclusion Strategy; 

  Official Languages Scheme; 

 

 

 

Legislative Software System; and  

aspects of business continuity project. 

CASE STUDY: Designing the Official Languages Scheme 

 

 

33 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Emanating from the statutory duty under the Official Languages Act (2012) to 
publish and adopt an Official Language Scheme [OLS], we have developed a new  
Scheme, which builds on the Assembly’s bilingual culture that has evolved since 
its inception. Part of this development work involved undertaking an equality 
impact assessment to ensure that diversity and inclusion considerations were 
taken into account. 

Procurement 

We take every opportunity to champion equality throughout our procurement 
process and ongoing contract management.  

Equality is included as part of our equality risk assessments at the very start of the 
procurement process and as part of the pre-qualification exercise. Suppliers who 
fail to demonstrate their commitment to equality are not invited to tender. Once 
contracts are awarded we conduct regular contract review meetings with our 
suppliers. One of the standard agenda items is corporate social responsibility. We 
also have equality clauses in our terms and conditions. 

We are an accredited living wage employer and ensure that the living wage is 
paid to contractors working in our buildings.   

Monitoring and reporting 

Our Annual Diversity and Inclusion Reports are scrutinised by the Commission’s 
Management Board and the Assembly Commission to ensure compliance with 
our legal and corporate responsibilities and to monitor progress.  

Going forward: 

We will evaluate relevant data and use best practice to inform how we continue to 
build diversity and inclusion into: 

including diversity and inclusion in our service plans; 

ensuring that equality impact assessments (EQIAs) are undertaken 
across the organisation and that staff have the confidence to undertake 
them; and 

ensuring that contract managers have the support necessary to build 
diversity and inclusion  into their review meetings.

Annex A: Workforce and Recruitment Monitoring Data 

Overview 

Our workforce exists to support the efficient running of the National Assembly for Wales by providing services to Assembly 
Members, their staff and the public. Each year, we collect, analyse and publish diversity data on our workforce profile and 
recruitment activity.  

This report sets out an analysis of the National Assembly for Wales Commission’s diversity profile of its workforce coupled 
with an analysis of diversity data for recruitment. 

From this information, we are able to examine the diversity profile of our workforce, the people we attract to apply for jobs 
and to whom we offer employment. We use the analyses of these monitoring exercises to help us ensure the diverse needs 
of staff and members of the public are met through improving policies, services and working practices. An equal pay audit 
report is also available at Annex B. 

The preparation and publication of this report meets the public sector duties set out in the Equality Act 2010. The report 
contains analyses of data which accords with the protected characteristics as defined by the Act. The data presented in this 
report is as of 31 March 2017.  

As 98% of our workforce is based in Cardiff Bay, we are using data from the 2011 Census, namely the Cardiff Travel to Work 
Area (TTWA) data set to compare the characteristics of our workforce and job applicants to the wider Cardiff population in 
terms of people of working age. 

 

 

35 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Our Approach to Workforce Monitoring 

Our workforce data is collated via our HR Payroll system and relates to staff directly employed by the Assembly Commission. 

One of our identified on-going actions is to further increase the number of staff who self-identify their diversity 
characteristics and update them on our HR Payroll system. We include declaration rates alongside our workforce data. 

Our Approach to Recruitment Monitoring 

The Assembly Commission’s recruitment policy is designed to be flexible: managers can access a series of prompt questions 
to assist them to determine whether they need to advertise vacancies internally, externally or both concurrently. 

The recruitment data in this report is related to external recruitment schemes that closed with appointments during the 
reporting period of 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. As such, this includes schemes which were advertised in the 2015-16 
reporting period but the appointment was not made until after 1 April 2016. The data also includes Assembly Commission 
staff who applied for vacancies which were advertised externally. 

During this reporting period, we have encouraged all applicants to submit their diversity monitoring data in order to 
complete the application process. Our Recruitment Team has proactively contacted applicants to complete the forms (with 
a choice including ‘prefer not to say’) if they have not already done so. This has resulted in the number of “no replies” to fields 
within the monitoring form being significantly reduced from the last reporting year; this applies across the protected 
characteristics.  

Our recruitment data is captured manually. We have also started to collate data for internal promotions; this pilot was 
initiated in-year therefore we only have partial data internal promotions for this reporting period. We will be able to publish a 
full data set for this in next year’s report. 

 

To ensure that our recruitment process is as inclusive as possible, we have: 

36 

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

 

 

gender-balanced panels; 

recruitment training for panel members; and  

  mandatory diversity training which includes recruitment and unconscious bias elements. 

Privacy 

Raw data is only seen by a small number of key staff in the HR Team and is held securely on a confidential basis and in line 
with data protection legislation.   

In terms of our workforce data and presentation, where there are small numbers of staff, we have merged certain categories 
within the tables in the report to ensure that individuals’ privacy is protected which is also in line with data protection 
legislation.

Workforce Composition 

Head count as of 31 March 2017: 466 staff (this includes three staff who were either seconded staff or agency staff). This

Analysis:

 

The age composition of our workforce has remained fairly static since 2014. 

According to data from the 2011 Census, 14.3% of people in the Cardiff Travel to Work Area (TTWA) who are 
economically active and employed are aged under 24.This compares to 6.2% of our workforce who are aged 25 
and under.  

19.5% of our workforce is aged between 51 and 65. This compares to data from the 2011 Census which states that 
23.9% of people who are economically active and employed in the Cardiff TTWA are aged 50 to 64.  

  We will continue to attract young people and older people into our workforce and will explore various options 

which could include undertaking further apprenticeship schemes and promoting the assembly as an employer of 
choice through recruitment outreach and by offering work placements. We will therefore take account of this as 
part of a wider strategy to address underrepresentation in our workforce via the development of an attraction 
strategy which is inclusive of all the protected characteristics; and 

 

The largest group of staff by age range is 31-35 group which represents 20.4% of all staff, a slight decrease from the 
last reporting period from 21.1%.

Analysis: 



 

The percentage of staff who declared a disability as at 31 March 2017 was 5.8% of our total workforce, an increase 
from 5.4% in 2016. We will continue to encourage all disabled staff to record their disability on the HR system, as 
we believe that many people with mental ill health, dyslexia and other long term health conditions who could 
identify with this definition of disability on our system, are not reflected in this data;  

The data shows that there is an uneven distribution of staff who identify as disabled across our workforce: 85% of 
our staff who identify as disabled are at the three lowest pay grades. 4.2% of the E2, E1 and Senior grades identify 
as disabled which is encouraging but we will continue to encourage staff to disclose their disability status on our 
self-service HR system; and 

The 2011 Census states that 8.3% of people who are economically active and employed in the Cardiff TTWA have a 
long-term health problem or disability that limits their day to day activities. As 5.8% of our workforce currently 
identifies as disabled, we would like this figure to align more with the Cardiff TTWA figure of 8.3%. We realise that 
this could involve encouraging staff to self-identify as disabled staff but also we need to be sure that we are 
attracting disabled people to apply for work with us. We will therefore take account of this as part of a wider 
strategy to address underrepresentation in our workforce via the development of an attraction strategy which is 
inclusive of all the protected characteristics.

The overall success rate for applicants who identify as disabled is 12.5%, compared with 2.0% from the last 
reporting year. The success rate for applicants who identify as disabled surpasses that of people who did not 
identify as disabled; 

9.8% of people offered a job declared a disability, compared to 2.3% in 2015-2016. This increase could be explained 
in that more people might be declaring a disability and the number of no replies has fallen from 5.1% of total 
applications to 2.5% in 2016-2017; and 

The percentage for successful at sift is the same for disabled and non-disabled people. The percentage of those 
offered employment is higher for disabled people than non-disabled people and the overall success rate is also 
higher. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions as the numbers remain small.

Analysis: 

 

 

 

 

This reporting period sees an equal 50:50 split between women and men in our overall workforce composition 
which has equalised from last year’s 52:48 ratio for women and men respectively; 

There also appears to be a relatively even gender distribution across the grades with the exception of the 
differential at TS grade with a 40:60 split for women and men and the differential of 62:38 at M2 grade where 
there are more women than men. This could be explained because of the prevalence of men at TS grade in the 
Security Team which we have taken steps to address by attempting to attract more women into the Security Team. 
The differential at M2 could be due to the preponderance of women in the Translation and Reporting Service; 

The data shows that the gender distribution across the manager grades (M3 to Senior) from the last reporting 
period where 54.4% of women were managers and 45.6% of men were managers has remained fairly static to 
54.1% and 45.9% respectively in this reporting period; and 

As of the last reporting period, this reporting period sees the top two tiers of decision-makers at E1 and Senior 
grades consist of 53% women which exceeds the ambition set out in the 50:50 by 2020 Campaign.

Analysis:

 

The 2011 Census data shows that 37.3% of women in the Cardiff TTWA work part-time. During this reporting period, 
26.6% of women in our workforce work part time, a small increase from 25.1% in 2015-16; 

The 2011 Census data shows that 9.9% of men in the Cardiff TTWA work part-time. During this reporting period, 
6.9% of men in our workforce work part time, a decrease from 8.4% in 2015-16; 

  Our part-time staff use a number of flexible working options as either a formal or informal arrangement. Flexible 
working options include: compressed hours, annualised flexi leave and working from home. Anecdotally, we are 
aware that many members of staff, including men at senior level, utilise these arrangements. The figures in the 
table above refer to formal arrangements only;  

 

The data shows that men are less likely to work part-time than women in our workforce, this is particularly the case 
for men in the top two grades (E1 and Senior) where no men work part-time on a formal basis but might utilise 
other flexible working options (as described above) ; and 

  We have also received recognition from Working Families for the breadth of flexible working options that we have 

available.

There has been a drop in the number of applications from people who identify as transgender, from four (0.5% of 
total applications) in 2015-2016 to one (0.1% of total applications) in 2016-2017; 

No replies continue to drop, from 9.4% in 2015-2016 to 3.3% in 2016-2017. However, this remains the highest 
number of no replies of all of the protected characteristics and it is difficult to draw conclusions as to why this 
might be; 

  While there is no comparative statistics for the Cardiff TTWA in relation to people who identify as trans, Stonewall 

estimate that approximately 1% of the population identifies as transgender. Because of the small numbers 
involved, it is difficult to draw conclusions on transgender applicants; and 

  We actively promote the Assembly as a trans-inclusive employer by attending Pride and Sparkle events, promoting 

our support for International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, celebrating LGBT History 
Month and Trans Visibility day. We are also ranked fifth in Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index that is now trans-
inclusive.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Analysis: 

 

 

The disclosure rate for the race/ethnicity profile is encouraging however, the number of staff who identify as BME 
has slightly decreased from 23 in 2016 to 20 in 2017, therefore the percentage of BME people in the total workforce 
has decreased from 5.2% in 2016 to 4.3 % in 2017. The 2011 Census states that 6.8% of people who are economically 
active and employed in the Cardiff TTWA identify as BME; we still continue to work to reverse this trend and aim for 
closer alignment with the TTWA figure of 6.8%; 

60% (12) of our BME staff are employed at entry level (TS grade).This has dropped from 69.6% (16) from 2016. This 
can be explained by the fact that four people who identified as BME (TS pay band) left the organisation during the 
reporting year. 15% of staff who identify as BME are employed at decision-making level at E2, E1 and Senior Level, 
which has increased from 9% the previous year although, caution should be exercised however as the data is 
sensitive to small changes in the cohort; 

  We can infer from the data that there is an uneven distribution of staff who identify as BME across our workforce: 

85% of staff who identify as BME are in the two lowest pay bands (TS and M3). In pay bands M2 and M1, no staff 
identify as BME. Given the declaration rate, this is concerning and could demonstrate that staff who are identifying 
as BME are not progressing within the organisation. Our partial internal promotion data also shows that no staff 
who identified as BME were promoted during the reporting period. and 

  Our BME Action Plan has been designed to address underrepresentation in the Assembly’s workforce which 
involves supporting our existing BME colleagues to fulfil their potential and also ensuring we take appropriate 
steps to attract the widest range of talent to apply for jobs with us. Our senior champion for BME colleagues and 
REACH, our Race Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage workplace equality network are raising the profile of the network, 
both internally and externally. We also intend to incorporate this work into a wider strategy to address 
underrepresentation in our workforce via the development of an attraction strategy which is inclusive of all the 
protected characteristics.

applications in 2015-2016 to 4.8% in 2016-2017. As such, the percentage of total applications is lower than the BME 
populations in the Cardiff TTWA; 

No replies dropped from 5.5% of total applications in 2015-2016 to 1.5% in 2016-2017;

The successful at sift, offer of employment and overall success rates are all significantly lower for people who 
identify as BME. We would like to see this equalised; and  

  We are taking steps to address under-representation within our workforce, including identifying and removing 

barriers to inclusion. We are encouraging applications from the widest pool of talent and undertake outreach work 
to promote the Assembly as an inclusive employer. We deliver unconscious bias training for all recruitment panels 
and will be undertaking an equality impact assessment of our recruitment policy and practices. This commitment

Although there was a slight increase in the declaration rate from 78% last year to 79.2 % this year, it is still lower 
than we would wish it to be, we will encourage staff to update their personal record; 

36.9% of staff who filled in their data on our HR self-service system declared no religion or belief (none); and 

It is difficult to draw any conclusions from this data set other than it could demonstrate a diversity of religious 
belief (including non-belief) in our workforce. We are a faith-friendly workplace, and we have flexible working 
arrangements in place for staff who wish to observe prayer and/or religious events and holiday; we have two on-site 
quiet rooms for staff and visitors to use should they wish.

The percentage of applications from people who declared other religions increased from 4.1% in 2015-2016 to 4.8% 
in 2016-2017.3.3% of job offers were made to people who declared “other religion”. Although as the number is so 
small, it is difficult to draw conclusions; 

The success rate of people who declared “other religion” has increased from 2.8% in 2015-2016 to 6.3% in 2016-2017 
but this could be due to an increase in the number of people filling in their equality monitoring data; and 

As stated under the table for Race / Ethnicity, we are taking to steps to address under-representation and to 
promote the Assembly as an employer of choice.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Analysis: 

 

 

The disclosure rate of 81.7% is lower than we would like it to be, hence we periodically remind and encourage staff 
to update their personal data on our HR self-service system; 

The number of staff who identify as LGB has decreased from 17 to 16 from the last reporting period, representing a 
very slight decrease from 3.8% to 3.4% of our total workforce. There currently is no comparative data available for 
the Cardiff TTWA for LGB people who are economically active and employed, however Stonewall estimates that 5-
7% of the population identify as LGB. Assuming that some of the population included in the 5-7% estimate will be 
people who are not economically active or in employment (due to their age), our workforce percentage of 3.4% 
could be considered broadly representative; and 

 

The data shows that 19% of our LGB staff are at senior decision-making level at E2, E1 and Senior grades, although 
caution is required as the sample size is small.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Analysis: 

 

 

 

Total percentage of applicants who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other sexual orientation (LGB+) has fallen 
from 7.7% to 5.3% and remains in line with Stonewall’s estimate of 5-7% of the local populations identifying as 
LGB+. 

“No Replies” has decreased significantly from 7.6% in 2015-2016 to 1.5% in 2016-2017. 

The success at sift, offer of employment and overall success rates are all significantly lower for LGB+ people, 
compared to non-LGB / heterosexual people. 1.6% of job offers were made to people who identify as LGB+.  

  We actively promote the Assembly as a LGB+-inclusive employer by attending Pride events, promoting our support 

for International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, and celebrating LGBT History Month. We 
are also ranked fifth in Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index and Ross Davies, the Assembly Commission’s Diversity 
and Inclusion Manager was recognised as Stonewall Cymru’s Ally of the Year for 2017. 

  We are taking steps to address under-representation within our workforce, including identifying and removing 

barriers to inclusion. We are encouraging applications from the widest pool of talent and undertake outreach work 
to promote the Assembly as an inclusive employer. We deliver unconscious bias training for all recruitment panels 
and will be undertaking an equality impact assessment of our recruitment policy and practices. This commitment 
is part of our new Diversity and Inclusion strategy for 2016-2021.

Maternity and Parental Leave 

During this reporting period: 

Maternity Leave and Returners  

Co-Parental/Paternity Leave  

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Eleven women returned from maternity leave during the 
reporting period, four of whom changed their work pattern on 
their return to work.  

Seven partners took co-parental leave, none of whom 
reduced their hours on return to work. 

Shared Parental Leave 

One person took Shared Parental Leave. 

Grievance, Disciplinary and Dismissal Related to Protected Characteristics 

In the reporting period, we had no grievance or dismissals primarily relating to protected characteristics.  

Complaints about Discrimination / Prohibited Conduct 

In the reporting period, we received one complaint on the grounds of discrimination in relation to a disciplinary case. The 
complaint was not taken further. No further details are supplied in order to protect individuals’ privacy.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Actions Going Forward: 

Following the analysis of the data for this reporting period, we have identified the following actions which will be taken into 
account with regards to the delivery of the Diversity and Inclusion Strategy: 

 

 

Continue to remind and encourage staff periodically to review and update their personal data on our HR IT Payroll 
system; and 

as part of a wider strategy to address underrepresentation in our workforce, develop an attraction strategy which is 
inclusive of all the protected characteristics and other inequalities where required.

Annex B: Equal Pay Audit and Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2017 

This report contains the Assembly Commission’s Equal Pay Audit for 2017 and also Gender Gap Reporting Data 2017. 

Equal Pay Audit 2017 

An equal pay audit involves comparing the pay of protected groups who are doing equal work in an organisation, 
investigating the causes of any pay gaps by gender, ethnicity, religion/belief, disability or working pattern and planning to 
close any gaps that cannot be justified on grounds other than one of those characteristics. An equal pay audit provides a risk 
assessment tool for pay structures1  

It can help organisations examine whether their pay practices are free from unfairness and discrimination and that they are 
compliant with the pay provisions in the Equality Act 2010. 
Essential features of a pay audit include: 

 

 

 

Comparing the pay of women and men; BME and white staff; disabled and non-disabled staff who are doing equal 
work; 

Explaining any pay gaps; and 

Closing those pay gaps that cannot satisfactorily be explained on grounds other then one of the protected 
grounds. 

Each year, the Assembly Commission conducts an equal pay audit to accompany the Annual Diversity Report and 
corresponding workforce and recruitment equality data. This process involves: 

 

Deciding the scope of the audit and identifying the data required;

 

 

 

 

Identifying where employees in protected groups are doing equal work; 

Collecting and comparing pay data to identify any significant equal pay gaps; 

Establishing the causes of any significant pay gaps and deciding whether these are free from discrimination; and 

Developing if required, an equal pay action plan and continuing to audit and monitor pay. 

This report reviews available pay data, identifies and explains any differentials and any improvement actions required.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2017 

This year, in addition to the equal pay review, we have provided data for new gender pay gap reporting purposes. As an 
employer, the Assembly Commission is now required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 

The gender pay gap is the difference in average pay between the men and women in your workforce. 

It is different to equal pay, which means you must pay men and women the same for equal or similar work. 2  

This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our 
organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employees’ data. We are required to publish the results on our own 
website and the UK Government’s Gender Pay Gap Reporting website.  

In line with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, employers need to publish six calculations 
showing: 

  mean gender pay gap in hourly pay; 

  median gender pay gap in hourly pay; 

  mean bonus gender pay gap; 

  median bonus gender pay gap; 

 

 

proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment; and the 

proportion of males and females in each pay quartile. 3

This data can be viewed in table 29 of this report. 

Context 

The data used in this report is as of 31 March 2017. The employee headcount as of this date was 462 members of staff which 
includes permanent and temporary staff. Secondments and staff currently on career breaks are not included [of which there 
are four members of staff].

Glossary 

Mean and median 

  Mean is the average hourly rate of pay, calculated by adding the hourly pay rate for employees then dividing by the 

number of employees. 

  Median is the middle hourly pay rate, when you arrange your pay rates in order from lowest to highest4  

Pay Grades 

We have pay grades with relatively short pay scales which helps to minimise the likelihood of pay discrimination occurring. 
An overview by grade is set out in table 1. A breakdown of pay scales is available on the Assembly’s website.  

All pay information is per annum unless otherwise specified.

Pay terms are as follows: 

  Our organisation makes minimal use of allowances, which helps to minimise potential for pay differentials; 

  We do not pay bonuses to any of our employees; 

 

 

Usual practice is for new starters to the Assembly Commission to begin on minimum pay point; 

Trade Union Side colleagues are involved in pay reviews and negotiations which take place every one to three years 
depending on economic conditions at the time; and

Equal Pay Audit 2017 

Gender Analysis 

Our organisation’s gender profile split is 50.0% men, 50.0% women (last year 48.2% men, 51.8% women). This result does 
not indicate a risk associated with the gender profile of the organisation.  

The analysis this year differs slightly from that presented in previous years by the inclusion of data (table 13) which looks at 
Gender Pay Gap in order to comply with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) 
Regulations 2017. 

Whilst both equal pay and the gender pay gap deal with the disparity of pay women receive in the workplace, they are two 
different issues5: 
 

 

 

Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive equal pay, 
as set out in the Equality Act 2010; and 

The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across an 
organisation or the labour market. It is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.

Analysis: 

The pay lead that women have over men has increased from last year’s figure of 18.3% to 31.1% on median for basic salary 
and from 29.6% to 31.1% on median for total salary (table 2). This compares to -9.4% in the UK6  

. The difference is attributable to the following key factors: 

 

 

A higher concentration of men in certain grades and women in others. For example, there is a high concentration 
of men largely graded as Team Support (TS) within teams and a high concentration of women in the specialist M-2 
grade. There are women at M1and M2 grades who are longer servers than men in those grades (Table 3);   

A staggered approach to ending additional to salary allowances: 2016-17 is the first year to realise the impact of 
agreements to halt allowances for procurement, ICT, and accountancy. The freeze and taper arrangements for 
bringing these to an end have been completed in 2015-16. As a number of male employees were in receipt of 
these, this has slightly suppressed the male median.

Actions: 

  We will review the gender profile of our workforce across service areas, identifying whether there are any barriers to 

recruitment and progression and taking necessary steps to address this.  

  We will also continue to review and monitor our allowances (which is in accordance with equal pay legislation).

Analysis: 

  We have attempted to recruit more women into the Visitor and Liaison and Security Team over the last few years 

and the increase in the number of women in  these roles has been gradual; and 

  M-1 pay band total salary differential of 12.6%: is largely due to a higher number of women who are also in receipt 

of skills based recruitment and retention allowance for specialist roles. There is also an element of comparative 
length of service contributing to this pay lead; and 

 

a CEO and Directors differential of 27.1% basic and 15.5% total salary - due to the small cohort involved and to 
protect privacy of individuals it is not possible to analyse this data further.

Analysis:  

 

 

Part-time women earn more than full-time men – this again is due to the prevalence of men in the TS pay band 
and the prevalence of women in the higher pay bands; and 

Last year Female PT versus Male FT difference in total median pay was 22.4%, compared to this reporting year of 
32.6%. This is likely explained by a slight increase in the number of male employees at TS pay band over the 
reporting year and the length of service of female employees in higher pay bands.

Analysis:  

 

The highest earners of total median salary are in 41-45 age bracket; and 

  Median salaries decrease for staff over 56 due to the predominance of older staff in the TS grade.

[27 staff identified as being Disabled; 397 staff identified as being Non-disabled; 38 staff chose not to reply] 

To calculate the differentials based on disability, disabled employees’ salaries are expressed as a percentage of non-disabled 
employees’ earnings. 

Analysis:  

 

  On a comparison of the entire workforce, rather than a grade by grade basis, staff who have declared themselves as 

disabled earn less than staff who have reported that they are not disabled or who have not replied, which is a 
reversal of last year’s position. The pay gap for median total FTE salary for disabled staff vs non-disabled vs is -15.5%. 
However, due to the small numbers involved, caution should be exercised as the data is sensitive to even small 
changes in the cohort. Based on the data presented, there does not appear however, to be an equal pay risk for 
disabled staff.

To calculate the differentials based on ethnicity, BME employees’ salaries are expressed as a percentage of non-BME (White) 
employees’ salaries. 

Analysis: 

  On a comparison of the entire workforce, rather than a grade by grade basis, staff who identify as White earn more 
than those who identify as any other category, save in the case of Other Ethnic Origin  where the mean basic and 
total FTE salary is higher than that of staff who identify as White. However, due to the small numbers involved in 
categories other than White, caution should be exercised as the data is sensitive to even small changes in these 
cohorts.

Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report 2016-17 

  Workforce monitoring data indicates that 60 % of staff who identify as BME are concentrated at the TS pay band. 
Our workforce data also indicates that 15% of staff who identify as BME are at Executive and Senior level and 85% 
of staff who identify as BME are in the lowest two pay bands. No staff identifying as BME are based at M2 and M1 
grades in this reporting year.

Pay difference for median total FTE salary for Asian Bangladeshi vs White is -32.9% 

Pay difference for median total FTE salary for Black African vs White is -27.2% 

Pay difference for median total FTE salary for  Other ethnic origin  vs White is -24.0% 

These differentials warrant further examination as we have identified similar differentials in previous reporting years 
for race/ethnicity. The actions we are continuing to take to address this via our BME action plan and strategy to 
address underrepresentation are:  

supporting existing BME staff to fulfil their learning and development and career  aspirations; 

Developing and rolling out an unconscious bias training module for all staff  

Utilising our REACH network and our Senior BME Champion to identify any areas for improvement in the 
workplace; 

Undertaking an equality impact assessment of our recruitment practices and processes; 

Developing an Attraction, Retention and Reward strategy which includes working with external partners as an 
employer of choice, looking at our offering for work placements and how we attract the widest range of talented 
people; and 

 

Developing a cultural awareness training module to offer staff.

Analysis: 

 

Based on the data presented, there does not appear to be an equal pay risk based on religion or belief. Whilst the 
staff who identify as Muslim are on lower pay when compared with the entire workforce, this is due to all three of 
these staff being employed in the TS grade which is the second lowest grade. None are currently employed in 
higher grades. The action points identified under the Race Analysis should also impact on this area. However, due 
to the small numbers involved in categories identified as being other than Christian or No Religion, caution should 
be exercised as the data is sensitive to even small changes in these cohorts.

Gender Pay Gap Reporting 

The Gender Pay Gap calculations are as required by the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) 
Regulations 2017. This differs from the calculations in the tables for our Equal Pay Audit (up to Table 12) for a number of 
reasons. These include: 

  Ordinary pay is calculated after salary sacrifices (e.g. for childcare vouchers, cycle to work scheme etc.) are 

excluded. This reduces the amount which is taken into account in the comparison. This has a greater effect on 
female hourly rates of pay than on male as women are more likely to take advantage of the childcare voucher 
salary sacrifice scheme; and 

 

The Equal Pay Audit data are based on a snapshot of salary levels as at 31 March 2017. The calculations for the 
Gender Pay Gap (table 13) are based on the salary for the whole of March and would therefore show a slightly lower 
figure if an employee had been promoted or received an incremental pay rise during the month of March.
