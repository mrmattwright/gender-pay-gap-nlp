BLP 2017 GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

As Managing Partner of a firm that is committed to 
gender diversity and increased representation, I am 
pleased to see the spotlight on gender pay, an area 
where progress has been required in the legal sector 
and the broader business community for some time.

We want to ensure that our employees are treated fairly 
and equally, and feel that their contribution is valued.

It’s important to our clients, and it’s important to us.  
Our statistics on equal pay speak for themselves.

The most informative statistics concern equal pay: that 
is comparability of pay for men and women performing 
the same or very similar roles. That said, we know that 
there remains work to do on our firm’s gender pay gap. 
This analysis will help us to shape our actions to achieve 
a more balanced business going forward.

At BLP we pride ourselves in a thorough salary review 
process to ensure equal pay for men and women 
where there is parity within roles. For those eligible 
for the firm’s bonus scheme we are confident that 

the criteria allows men and women equal opportunity 
to earn a bonus. We will continue to ensure that the 
drivers behind bonus and pay awards are led by 
objectivity and integrity.

The breakdown of men and women in the pay quartiles is as follows:

Having undertaken the same analysis for our London 
Business Services and Secretarial population, 82% of 
whom fall within tiers 1-3, we only see a gender pay 
gap of 1.4%. With the remaining 18% in tiers 4-6 the 
gap is 30.4%. Our in-depth analysis shows that our 
pay gap exists primarily because of the distribution 
of men and women within different roles in the 
firm, with larger percentages of women than men 
in lower-middle to lower quartiles, and more than 
three-quarters of our support population comprising 
of women.

Gender Diversity – a Strategic Priority for the firm
In 2014 we set ourselves one of  
the most stretching gender 
targets in the sector to achieve 
30% women in our UK partnership 
by the end of 2018 and an 
increased number globally. We 
are pleased the number currently 
stands at 27.8% and are working 
hard to meet the 30% by the end 
of the calendar year.

• 

7th most inclusive workplace in the UK  
(inclusive top 50 employers 2017) and 45% of 
fathers that have taken paternity leave have  
opted in to Shared Parental Leave (SPL), 
significantly more than the national average, 
which is between 2% and 8%.

Because of this, we are proud to be recognised as a top 30 Employer for Working Families 2017. Building on the 
progress that we have made, moving forward, gender parity will continue to be a priority for our firm.
