We support the fair treatment of all staff, irrespective of gender through our transparent recruitment, pay, and professional development processes.  The trust has 890 employees. 290 (28%) are male and 643 (72%) are female. We are a flexible employer and a number of our employees take up this flexibility with 13% of male employees and 35% of female employees choosing to work part time.

For non teaching staff we use pay scales set by the National Joint Council for Local Government Services (NJC). Staff move through the pay scales for their grade based on a thorough and robust performance management process, meaning earnings are determined by performance outcomes, irrespective of gender. Bonus payments are awarded to Principals and senior members of support staff and are determined by the outcome of performance management processes.  We have a higher proportion of females in every quartile, including the upper. This illustrates that the overall pay gap is as a result of a low proportion of males in the more junior grades.

The pay gap reduced when split into groups within the same pay grading systems.  Although we have a majority of females in the junior pay grades, we also have a majority of women in the upper leadership grades. Across Inspiration Trust female employees account for 56% of all Assistant Principal, Vice Principal, and Principal posts. The Trust senior leadership team consists of 80% female employees including the Chief Executive Officer.
