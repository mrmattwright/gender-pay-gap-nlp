                               CDS United Kingdom        Home    About Us   Our Values   Diversity and Inclusion  Employee Testimonials    Careers at CDS     Contact    ISO Certification      Being a customer orientated service delivery organisation, at CDS we value our workforce as our main and most important asset. Developing and rewarding our employees with fairness and equity is not only engrained in our culture, but is also an integral part of our Employee Value Proposition.     Our Gender Pay Gap figures at a glance:     Proportion of employees who received a bonus in the 12 months to 5 April 2017:     21 % Female     20 % Male      With the majority of our employees operating in a highly technical environment, we face challenges related to gender diversity similar to those in most companies in the IT industry.  Our analysis shows a mean gender pay gap between male and female earnings of 29.0% and a median of 34.5% respectively. This is based on hourly pay rates as at the snapshot date of 5th April 2017. The delta is predominantly down to lack of female representation in senior technical and management roles.  With broadly equal percentage (20% vs 21%) of male and female employees receiving a bonus in the 12 months to April 2017, we are confident that we recognise and reward high performance with fairness and equity. Furthermore, our median Gender Bonus Gap is negative, meaning that the medium size of bonus payment received by our female staff is bigger than that of male staff. The mean Gender Bonus Gap is 25%.    Pay Quartiles:            While we recognise that differences in the roles men and women take often depend on personal choices and preferences, we are determined to ensure an inclusive environment where all employees have fair access to career opportunities and reward programmes. Therefore, we will continue to drive and enhance our recruitment processes, as well as recognition and development programmes such as LEAD (Lead, Engage and Develop), Development Review Board, Modern Apprentice Programme, Excellence Award Scheme, etc.  As part of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) group, we are fully compliant to the HPE Service of Business Conduct, which also ensures the retention and inclusiveness of a diverse workforce.
