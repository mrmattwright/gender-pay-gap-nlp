It also provides narrative to put the gender pay gap into context.  The gender pay gap is a simple average figure for all employees within the UK workforce, irrespective of the job that they do. Frontier’s gender pay gap is largely a result of the high percentage of males in senior leadership and technical programming roles, which command a high salary.  The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. Frontier regularly reviews remuneration arrangements to ensure that male and female staff receive equal pay for carrying out the same work, or equivalent work.
