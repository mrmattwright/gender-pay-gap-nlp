Introduction  Section 78 of the Equality Act 2010, the Equality Act (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2016, is now in effect and places particular obligations on Employers to assess and report their gender pay gap.  Its provisions make it obligatory for businesses employing over 250 staff to publish information reporting the differences in pay levels between male and female employees. Gender pay reporting is most notably about female representation in certain roles.  The information held in this report relates to Wynnstay (Agricultural Supplies) Limited and must be published annually and be displayed on the Company website remaining there for a period of 3 years.  Gender Pay Gap Reporting System  The law requires employers to annually report their average and median pay gaps, the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the pay structure, and the gender pay gaps for any bonuses paid during the year. There are six calculations which must be published.  The payroll data extracted includes employees who are defined as Relevant and Full Pay employees and their Ordinary Pay (including basic pay, hourly pay, production bonuses and shift pay for example) as at the ‘Snapshot Date’  The data set includes 421 males and 186 females. The following percentages have been reported to the Government Gender Pay Gap Services Portal:       Gap    Hourly Rate – Mean  25%    Hourly Rate – Median  22%    Bonus Pay – Mean  79%    Bonus Pay - Median  74%          Male  Female    Proportion of M/F paid bonuses  85%  81%    Upper Quartile  88%  12%    Upper Middle Quartile  73.5%  26.5%    Lower Middle Quartile  56%  44%    Lower Quartile  60%  40%     Narrative  The headline percentages are understood to be primarily driven by the expected traditional representation of men in long established positions in agricultural sales, manufacturing, and distribution roles which comprise some 40% of all roles in the data set. Wynnstay’s boasts an exceptionally low turnover, and the workforce gender split is 70% male and 30% female. Additionally, our sales, manufacturing and distribution positions carry working patterns with unsociable hours, and pay structures and earnings which are heavily weighted to productivity bonuses.  Wynnstay’s ongoing commitment to reducing the current pay gap will continue while deploying various sound management practices in support of fairness and equality through a comprehensive and holistic people management and development framework. Responsibility for fair and equitable management practice remains with our management teams however governance, audit and control is the responsibility of the HR function which support management and all staff.  Our focus is equality of pay and career opportunity, implementing plans that engender a commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace through providing equal opportunities, while monitoring and governing decision making relating to pay structure, recruitment, and career progression.  Our action plan in support of reducing the pay gap includes the following ongoing strategies:   A strengthened, recognised HR function which supports and promotes evidence based decision making specifically with regards to recruitment, resourcing, career opportunity and reward, while promoting the ethical philosophies, values and morals of the business  Encouraging applications for vacancies from an array of backgrounds and experiences, supported by internal training programmes and development opportunities  Role criteria and job design assessments on a continuous basis, with a conscious desire to upskill lower paid positions  Pay review assessments on a continuous basis particularly on those occasions where salary proposals and changes result from market forces as necessary to retain talent.  Carry out systematic exit interviews and assessments to audit employment management practice.   Accuracy Declaration:  I confirm that the data and information published in this report is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and has been produced in accordance with the Equality Act (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2016.
