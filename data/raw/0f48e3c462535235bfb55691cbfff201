OPENING STATEMENT 
by Mr Pieraldo Oldano

At Thorntons Limited, we believe that a diverse 
and inclusive culture is essential for a business 
to grow and succeed. It is a necessary 
foundation for attracting and retaining talented 
individuals and engaging with those who buy our 
products. 

Whilst there is not a short term solution to 
improving our pay gap, we are committed to 
ensuring that all individuals, regardless of 
gender, race, ethnicity or background, have an 
equal opportunity to thrive and reach their full 
potential. 

We welcome the Government’s initiative for UK 
companies with over 250 employees to report on 
their gender pay gap. This report documents 
Thorntons Limited’s gender pay gap information 
and considers the main causes of the pay gap, 
and sets out our plans for closing it. 

We are passionate about ensuring equal 
opportunities for female and male staff at all 
levels of our organisation. We will continue to 
take meaningful action and initiatives which 
speciﬁcally identify and address the reasons 
behind the gap.

Acknowledging that Thorntons Limited forms a 
part of a bigger story for Ferrero in the UK we 
are working on a regional roadmap for 2018 and 
beyond that will focus on the wider business, 
however, as this report is driven by our statutory 
obligations and relates to the 2017 position, the 
focus in this report is on Thorntons Limited.

Our gender pay gap is largely inﬂuenced by the 
demographics in our highest pay quartile as we 
have a higher representation of males in senior 
grades.

UNDERSTANDING 
THE GENDER PAY GAP

THE GENDER PAY GAP IS THE DIFFERENCE IN PAY BETWEEN 
MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS AN ENTIRE ORGANISATION AS 
CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S 
PRESCRIBED METHODOLOGY.  

The mean gender pay gap is the difference in 
the average hourly rate of pay for men and 
women across the business. 

The median gender pay gap looks at the 
difference in hourly pay for the middle male 
and middle female employee in an 
organisation when ranking a company’s male 
and female populations from lowest to 
highest hourly pay. 

As part of the gender pay reporting process, we are required to split our workforce 
into four equal groups to show the proportion of men and women in each quartile. We 
did this by listing employees from the lowest hourly paid to the highest hourly paid, 
and then dividing the list of employees into four equal parts. 

The gender pay gap reporting process requires a large number of variables to be 
distilled into a few statistical ﬁgures, making direct comparisons with other 
organisations difﬁcult. 

It is also particularly important to appreciate that the gender pay gap is not the same 
thing as equal pay.  Equal pay means paying a man and woman the same pay for 
performing the same or broadly similar work. By contrast, the gender pay gap 
requires the pay of the average man within the whole organisation to be compared 
with the pay of the average woman. We are conﬁdent that our gender pay gap is not a 
reﬂection of an equal pay issue; instead it is driven by the structure of our workforce 
and the fact that we have more men than women in senior, and therefore more highly 
paid roles, when viewing the workforce as a whole. This demographic challenge is 
well known and shared by many other companies both in the retail and 
manufacturing sectors and beyond.

THE GAP

KEY FACTORS WHICH IMPACT
THORNTONS LTD GAPS

From our analysis of our gender pay gap 
results, we have identiﬁed the following 
trends:

Women form 67% of our total workforce. 
They occupy 45% of the roles in the upper 
pay quartile, but hold a signiﬁcantly 
higher proportion of roles than men in the 
lower pay quartiles. As a consequence, 
average male earnings are higher than 
average female earnings because of the 
combination of these two factors. 

We celebrate the fact that many of our 
employees choose to remain with and 
invest in the organisation for many 
years. We recognise low turnover in 
senior positions means there is limited 
opportunity in the short to medium term 
to address the gender imbalance at the 
more senior levels although this is 
something we are nonetheless committed 
to tackling.

Our pay gap is signiﬁcantly lower in 
certain parts of our organisation in 
which most of our staff are employed. 
The majority of our employees (2500 out 
of 2786) work in manufacturing and 
retail. Our combined mean gender pay 
gap across these two areas is 10.45%.

We have a positive gender pay gap in 
retail. The majority of women in our 
organisation (1322 out of 1860 female 
employees) work in retail. In this area of 
the business the average female 
earnings are higher than the average 
male earnings (with a mean gender pay 
gap of -0.74% and median gender pay 
gap of 9.14%).

Our bonus pay gap (mean gap of 22.57% 
and median gap of 5.40%) is reﬂective of 
the higher proportion of male employees 
in senior positions and that fact that 
bonus payments will often bear some 
correlation to an individual’s rate of pay.

Continuing to track key metrics and 
trends on pay parity and pay differences 
to ensure that the rationale for pay 
differences is consistent with our robust 
employment practices and not formed 
out of unfair bias or discrimination.  

MENTORING 
PROGRAMMES

Targeted Mentoring programmes 
for employees to ensure talent 
retention, talent development and 
empowerment.

UNCONSCIOUS
