Gender	Pay	Gap	Reporting	

	

With	effect	from	2017	it	has	become	a	legal	requirement	for	companies	with	250	or	more	
employees	to	carry	out	Gender	Pay	Reporting	under	the	Equality	Act	2010	(Gender	Pay	Gap	
Information)	Regulations	2017.	

Gender	Pay	Reporting	requires	our	organisation	to	make	calculations	based	on	employee	gender.	
We	have	established	this	by	using	our	existing	HR	and	Payroll	records.	

This	involves	carrying	out	six	calculations	that	show	the	difference	between	the	average	earnings	of	
men	and	women	in	our	organisation;	it	does	not	involve	publishing	individual	employee’s	data.	

We	can	use	these	results	to	assess:	

•  The	levels	of	gender	equality	in	our	workplace	
•  The	balance	of	male	and	female	employees	at	different	levels	
•  How	effectively	talent	is	being	maximised	and	rewarded	

We	are	required	to	publish	the	results	on	our	own	website	and	a	government	website.	

Below	is	the	statutory	information	and	the	background	of	our	results:	

Mean	Gender	Pay	Gap	
Median	Gender	Pay	Gap	
Mean	Gender	Bonus	Gap	
Median	Gender	Bonus	Gap	
Proportion	of	Males	Receiving	a	Bonus	
Proportion	of	Females	Receiving	a	Bonus	

	

15%	
2%	
82%

86%	
80%	

The	mean	gender	pay	gap	of	15%	is	a	result	of	the	highest	paid	employees	in	the	group	being	male.	
The	median	presents	a	lower	pay	gap	which	is	less	affected	by	the	higher	margins.

The	mean	gender	bonus	gap	of	82%	includes	the	sales	team	and	director	bonuses	all	of	which	are	
male,	however	overall	a	significant	number	of	females,	80%	do	receive	a	bonus	payment.

The	quartile	analysis	shows	the	largest	gaps	in	the	Lower	Middle	and	Upper	quartiles.	All	quartiles	
show	a	higher	percentage	of	males	as	the	majority	of	the	workforce	are	male.		

I	confirm	the	data	reported	is	accurate.
