Erskine Stewart’s Melville Schools
GENDER PAY GAP REPORT
APRIL 2017

GENDER PAY REPORTING
Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 
250 or more employees to publish statutory calculations 
every year showing how large the pay gap is between 
their male and female employees. The analysis is based 
on data as at 5th April each year. The gender pay gap 
shows the differences in the average pay between men 
and women.
At ESMS we are dedicated to the principles of equality in 
the workplace. We are confident that individuals in the 
same roles will be paid the same, regardless of gender, 
and that our pay gap is driven by the make-up of our 
workforce.

more than 70% of the other three quartiles and within these there are a range of different job roles.

CONFIRMATION STATEMENT
The data above represents Erskine Stewart’s Melville Schools’ gender pay gap in line with the reporting requirements. I am 
confident that men and women are paid equally for doing the same job, via the application of our incremental teaching and 
support staff pay scales, and that the data shown is accurate. As an organisation, we will continue to monitor our gender pay 
gap and we remain dedicated to the principles of equality in the workplace.
