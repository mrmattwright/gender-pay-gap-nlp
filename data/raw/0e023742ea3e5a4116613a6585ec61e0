We operate a fair job evaluation scheme to measure the relative value of all job within our business that is consistent, transparent and fair. We strive to eliminate any gender bias in our pay and remuneration systems and understand that equal pay between males and females is a moral obligation and a legal right in accordance with the Equality Act 2010. We are committed to conducting regular pay audits and pay reviews and taking swift and specific action to address any inequality should it be highlighted.  The information we are required by legislation to publish is detailed below. Due to the size of our organisation, a certain level of caution needs to be exercised when reviewing these figures because of the relatively low numbers employed within a business of our size and the risk of skewing associated with that.  Mean Pay Gap 10%  Median Pay Gap 9%  Mean Bonus Pay Gap 63%  Median Bonus Pay Gap 43%  Males receiving Bonus Pay 99%  Females receiving Bonus Pay 99%  Quartile Distribution Male/Female  1st Quartile 50/50  2nd Quartile 59/41  3rd Quartile 68/32  4th Quartile 70/30  Pay Gap  We have made great progress in harmonising the pay of comparable roles within many areas of our business and whilst we are pleased to see these figures are significantly lower than the National Average there is further work to do on reducing the gap. The evaluation of roles will continue.  Bonus Pay Gap  Adnams operate a Profit Share scheme that all employees benefit from after six months of service. Historically we have paid further bonuses to key roles within our sales Teams. This team is currently 80% male and this accounts for the larger gap. As we move to incentivising larger groups of employees and as we implement measures to increase diversity through our recruitment practices we envisage this gap closing  Quartile Distribution  Adnams have successfully facilitated the progression of female employees internally and has, in recent years, appointed a number of female candidates into senior roles. There is a strong pipeline of female talent within the region and within our business but this will take time to filter through to the upper two quartiles. Our Talent Management Strategies will ensure potential is identified and developed at all levels and across all business areas regardless of gender. Our approach to flexible working will ensure that opportunities are available for all based on aptitude and ability.
