This page and the document below provides information about the council’s gender pay gap. Gender pay gap is concerned with variances in the average earnings of men and women, regardless of role or seniority. It is a broader measure of capturing not only if any equal pay issues exist, but also any pay inequalities resulting from variances in the sorts of jobs performed by men and women and the gender composition of the workforce by seniority. We have published figures confirming the following: Gender pay gap in mean hourly pay Gender pay gap in median hourly pay Mean bonus pay gender pay gap Median bonus pay gender pay gap Proportion of males and females receiving bonus pay Proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band For further information regarding the council’s Gender Pay Gap Reporting please contact the council’s Reward Manager on 020 8489 3692.
