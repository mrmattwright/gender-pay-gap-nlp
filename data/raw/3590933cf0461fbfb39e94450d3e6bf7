What is the Gender Pay Gap? The gender pay gap is the measure of difference between men and women’s average hourly earnings in any business, regardless of their role or department.  A range of factors can influence the statistics, including the number of men and women employed within the organisation across all positions. The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. ‘Equal pay’ relates to men and women being paid equally for jobs that are deemed to be the same, similar, or of equal value.  In a report published on the Government’s Gender Pay website, IPL has reported that, for the 2017 Gender Pay Gap reporting period:   The median pay difference between men and women employed by IPL is 6.13% - this is better than the national average of 18.4%  The mean pay difference between men and women employed by IPL is 16.82% - this is better than the national average of 17.4%   77.9% of IPL’s colleagues work in operational roles in our processing sites. In respect of those colleagues, the median gender pay gap is 2.60% and the mean gender pay gap is 3.58%.  IPL’s Group People Director, Carolyn Hobdey said; “During 2017 we commenced a project aimed at transforming our remuneration structure for certain sections of our colleague base; the implementation of this work will continue through until 2020. During this time we are also undertaking a similar review of the rest of our workforce to determine whether any further changes need to be considered and discussed with the relevant colleagues.”  You can read IPL’s Gender Pay Report in full by clicking here .  In addition, we have also published Gender Pay Reports for our subsidiary companies, Forza Foods Limited and Kober Limited, as they do not operate their own websites.  These reports can be found by here (Forza) and here (Kober) .    < Back To News           Terms & Conditions | Terms of Engagement | Cookie Policy | Privacy Policy | Statement of Ethics (PDF) | Modern Slavery Statement (PDF)
