The data allows us to evaluate the gender pay gap, which is a measure of the difference between the average earnings of men and women.  Measuring a gender pay gap is not the same as measuring equal pay. Equal pay means being paid the same for the same / similar work. Newton conducts periodic reviews of pay levels across all comparable roles in the business to ensure that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs with similar levels of experience and skill. Newton welcomes initiatives that encourage greater gender diversity.
