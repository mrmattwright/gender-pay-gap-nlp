Gender Pay Statement

for OVO Energy.

OVO Energy Gender Pay Statement

2017/2018

What is the gender pay gap?
The Government introduced new regulations 
requiring all companies with more than 250 
employees to publish set gender pay figures, as 
well as gender bonus figures, by 4 April 2018.

These figures show average earnings of men and 
women across a business, irrespective of role, 
nature of work or seniority - in this way it shows 
if there is a difference in the number of men and 
women employed by a business, their seniority 
and which area of the business they work. 

The gender pay gap is not about comparing pay 
for men and women doing the same job and OVO 
Energy has robust processes to ensure our pay 
rates are reviewed and set fairly and consistently.

Why does OVO Energy have 
a gender pay gap?

We understand the figures show a gap which 
follows society-wide trends. However, we take 
responsibility to understand and address the 
reasons behind it. 

OVO Energy has continued to grow rapidly, and 
as such, attracting and retaining the best talent 
has always been at the heart of our people 
strategies. As a technology-focused business, with 
a fast growth trajectory in areas of the business 

that are traditionally male-dominated, we’ve seen 
our initial 50:50 gender split move to a growing 
difference in the number of male and female 
employees.

We are actively aware of this and the importance 
of continuing to be an inclusive place to work, we 
therefore try and attract the best female talent in 
all areas of our business.

Our next steps? 
At OVO Energy we are passionate about cultivating an inclusive working environment, which is better 
for everyone. We are aiming to do that by putting even more focus on Inclusion and Diversity and 
establishing a more formal strategy to positively champion this through the following actions in 2018: 

•

•

•

•

Establishing an Inclusion and Diversity Steer 
Co of senior leaders to drive positive change 
and lead inclusitivity within their areas, working 
closely with Employee Forum. 
 
Continuing to have a representative from OVO 
Energy on Bristol’s Women in Business TaskForce, 
part of Bristol Council’s Women’s Commission. 
 
Continuing to offer flexible working and a Family 
Friendly policy to help everyone find the best 
life-work balance for them. 
 
Continuing to grow OVO Networks, positively 
encouraging employees and providing budget    
to set up networks that are important to them.

•

•

•

Continuing to run Coder Dojo sessions for 
children to encourage, and open doors to, a 
technology career path from at an early age. 
 
Remain committed to attracting the best female 
talent in technology through advertising on 
womenintech.co.uk, posting gender inclusive 
job posts and role-modelling through speaking 
and hosting various networking events.  
 
External pledge with Powerful Women aspiring 
to increase our female population in senior 
leadership, within Technology and Smart 
Metering Engineering. 

We aim to continually improve our gender gap and will publish the results again in April 2019 as a requirement 
of the government initiative into gender pay.
