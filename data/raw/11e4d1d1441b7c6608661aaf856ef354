1.  Background 
 
Gender Pay Gap legislation requires all employers of 250 or more employees to publish their 
gender pay gap information by the 31st March 2018 and by the same date every subsequent 
year.  
 
A gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women across 
an 
earnings. 
 
The Trust's gender pay gap information has been obtained from the Electronic Staff Record 
(ESR reporting tool that was nationally developed to ensure the NHS meets its gender pay 
gap  reporting  requirements.  The  reporting  period  for  our  gender  pay  gap  data  uses  the 
snapshot date of 31 March 2017. 
 
The  gender  pay  gap  differs  from  equal  pay.  Equal  pay  deals  with  the  pay  differences 
between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It 
is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The gender pay 
gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women. If a workplace has 
a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may a number of issues to deal 
with, and the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are. 
 
The  report  highlights  there  is  a  gender  pay  gap  within  the  Trust.  An  initial  action  plan  in 
response  to  this  data  has  been  developed  and  will  form  part  of  the  Trust’s  Equality  and 
Diversity work programme. A more detailed analysis of the data will be undertaken to further 
inform the action plan.

There is a lower than average percentage of women in senior positions and a high number 
of women in lower paid roles. 
 
The Kingston NHS Trust Equality Statement confirms that:  
 
The Trust is committed to promoting equality, valuing diversity and protecting Human Rights 
and is committed to eliminating discrimination against any individual on the grounds of age, 
disability,  gender  reassignment,  marriage  and  civil  partnership,  pregnancy  and  maternity, 
race,  religion  or  belief,  sex,  and  sexual  orientation,  as  well  as  to  promote  positive  practice 
and value the diversity of all individuals and communities. 
 
To this end, the Trust has a long term strategy and will take steps to close the pay gap. The 
initial proposed actions in respect of this are: 
  
1.  As part of our wider recruitment and retention strategy, the Trust will ensure recruitment 
panels  are  gender  balanced  and  consider  other  measures  to  encourage  and  support 
women into senior roles.  

2.  The Trust will raise awareness and provide relevant training in Unconscious Bias and its 

impact. 

3.  The Trust will continue to support women to return to work after maternity leave. Flexible 
working  options  including  agile  working,  career  breaks  and  opportunities  for  career 
progression will be reviewed. 

4.  The Trust will encourage more female employees to undertake Leadership Development 

programmes that would help them transition into more senior positions. 

5.  For  Clinical  Excellence  Awards,  the  Trust  will  implement  the  new  national  scheme  and 

encourage more applications from women.
