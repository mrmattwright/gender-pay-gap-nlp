Tilney’s gender pay gap report 2017

Background

Gender split – pay quartiles

This year, for the first time, all UK companies with more than 250 
employees are required to disclose their gender pay gap. The gender 
pay gap measures the difference between the average earnings of 
men and women across an organisation. 

The chart below shows the proportion of men and women in 4 pay 
quartiles, with quartile 1 being the lowest paid quarter of the Tilney 
population and quartile 4 being the highest paid quarter.

Transparency makes change happen and we think this is an 
important milestone in the drive to create stronger gender diversity 
across UK businesses as a whole and in particular the financial 
services sector which Tilney operates within, where progress has 
been slow.

Tilney’s gender pay gap is largely as a result of the make-up of our 
workforce. In particular, men account for a high proportion of our fee 
earning adviser positions while nine out of ten part-time employees 
are women. Although female representation is growing overall, we 
still have more women in more junior, lower paid roles and more men 
in senior highly paid roles. 

The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay.  Equal pay relates 
to men and women being paid equally for doing the same work or 
similar work. 

Our gender pay gap shows we need to focus on minimising barriers 
so all our people to fulfil their potential and we have more work to do 
to enable women to progress through to all levels in the organisation.

Understanding Tilney’s gender pay gap

Tilney’s gender pay gap is not a pay issue - we are confident of this as 
we regularly review our pay policies to ensure these are gender 
neutral, and the pay of each employee to ensure we offer equal pay 
for “like work” regardless of gender.

Our gender pay gap is driven by the make up of our workforce.  

There is a greater proportion of men in our fee earning and senior 
management positions and these roles command higher salaries and 
bonus potential: 

of our fee earning/senior 
management positions are occupied 
by men.

There is also a greater proportion of women in part time roles, and as 
we can only report pro-rated figures for those employees who work 
reduced hours this also impacts the gender pay gap for Tilney.

of employees who work part time are 
women.

What are we doing about our gender pay gap?

Tilney recognises that a more diverse workforce is good business, however there remains a great deal to be done to achieve our goals. In 
particular, we need to take a closer look at the structure of our workforce and what we can do to get more women into fee earning and senior 
roles.

We are committed to: 

•

Encouraging and supporting more women to enter our profession and providing the support for them to progress; 

• Continuing to regularly review the pay differentials between men and women;

• Raising awareness, calling out and challenging any unconscious bias behaviour across all areas of Tilney;

• Developing a colleague networking group to help address issues around diversity and inclusion with a specific immediate focus on gender 

equality;

•

Identifying, regularly reviewing and supporting our female talent pipeline;

• Better publicising and developing our flexible working options
