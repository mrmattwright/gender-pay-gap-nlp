Commentary 

 

This set of results reflects an organisation where women face no barriers to career progression and 
are disproportionately represented at all levels, versus national averages. The national public sector 
mean and median pay gaps have been estimated as 17.7% and 19.4% respectively.  Our workforce is 
heavily skewed to part time work, 74% of our employees work part time and only 8% of these 
employees are male.  Within the senior management team 75% of the roles are held by female 
employees, this rises to 80% within the next tier of service heads. 
 
Given the methodology used in calculating these figures, the most effective action that would 
reduce the pay gap would be to actively recruit more male employees into the lower quartile part 
time roles. 
 
The analysis of comparable roles shows that we reward men and women fairly and there is no 
difference in pay rates for differing genders occupying the same or similar roles. Edsential doesnâ€™t 
pay a bonus to any employee group.
