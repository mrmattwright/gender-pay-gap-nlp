From 2017, Wyvern College Academy Trust is required to publish a mandatory set of figures on its own public facing website and the Government website, by 30 March of each year.  This relates to the snapshot period of the 31 March of the previous year.  For the snapshot year of 31 March 2017, Wyvern College Academy Trust figures are as follows:        Pay [2]      Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay  (men currently earn more)    32.8%      Median gender pay gap in hourly pay (men currently earn more)    58.0%      Bonus [3]      Mean bonus gender pay gap    0%      Median bonus gender pay gap    0%      Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment    0%      Proportion of females receiving a bonus payment    0%      Pay quartiles      Top quartile    Male    38.6%      Female    61.4%      Upper middle quartile    Male    21.1%      Female    78.9%      Lower middle quartile    Male    10.5%      Female    89.5%      Lower quartile    Male    21.1%      Female    78.9%        Pay  The Governing Body of Wyvern College Academy Trust is committed to the principle of equal pay for all employees, irrespective of gender, and ensures that it meets the requirements of the Equal Pay Act 1970.  The school’s approach to pay is set out in the school’s pay policy and the Governing Body aims to achieve equality in its pay and reward arrangements.  The Governing Body ensures that teaching staff are paid the correct salary and allowances in accordance with the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document, a national statutory document regulating pay of teaching staff.  The Governing Body ensures that school support staff are paid the correct salary and allowances in accordance with the Employment in Hampshire County Council (EHCC) 2007 Agreement and subsequent variations.  The Hay job evaluation scheme, which sits behind the EHCC agreement, provides an objective and gender neutral framework to evaluate the jobs that are carried out within the school.  Our gender pay gap of 32.8% is not as a result of paying men more than women for the same or equivalent work.  Bonus  There are no bonus payments for the reporting period.  [1] https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2017/9780111152010  [2] The pay period is the period in which the relevant employer pays the relevant employee basic pay, i.e. 1 to 31 March.  [3] Bonuses are included in the calculations if they have actually been received within this bonus period, i.e. the 12 month preceding the snapshot date, 1 April to 31 March.
