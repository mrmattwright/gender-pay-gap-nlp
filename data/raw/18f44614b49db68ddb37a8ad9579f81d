ACCA’s UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017  This report is another landmark for ACCA as an employer, as it’s the first time we’ve published the gender pay gap for our UK workforce.  The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 require relevant UK employers with 250 or more employees to publish information on their gender pay gap.  Although ACCA does not fall into the category of UK employers required to publish their gender pay gap, we welcome opportunity to voluntarily report and we’re publishing our report as a clear and visible sign of our commitment to equality and diversity.
