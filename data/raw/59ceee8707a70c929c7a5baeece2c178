Accenture’s median pay gap in the U.K. is 10.2 percent—versus 18.1 percent across all companies in the U.K., on average—and its mean pay gap is 16.7 percent.   The company also reported its median bonus gap is 33.4 percent and its mean bonus gap is 52 percent.   U.K. government regulations introduced earlier this year require companies with 250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap information by April 2018 and each following year. Accenture continues increasing the number of women in its most senior roles, which is key to closing the pay and bonus gaps.   “We welcome the measurement and transparency that the Government’s gender pay gap regulations bring,” said Olly Benzecry, chairman of Accenture in the U.K. and Ireland. “While our gender pay gap today in the U.K. is better than the average across the country, we still have work to do.   “We have an unwavering commitment to gender equality and working to close the pay gap – and attracting, developing and advancing women at all levels is critical to our business and an essential element of an inclusive, innovative workplace,” Benzecry added.   Minister of State for Apprenticeships, Skills and Women Anne Milton said, “I am very pleased to see Accenture publish their gender pay gap statistics. As more companies take this important step we are able to see greater transparency in workplace pay. Employers are then able to take steps to help women get back into the workplace after time away, and to make sure women get opportunities for progression at work—both of which will help to bring down barriers and tackle inequality.   “Closing the gender pay gap isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense, so that employers can take action to make sure every employee reaches their full potential.”  To support advancing more women to senior levels, Accenture uses approaches like Unconscious Bias training for all decision-making executives. Also, innovative new initiatives like its recently launched Break|Through programme in the U.K. provide training and re-entry support to people returning to work after a career break.   Globally, Accenture has set a goal to achieve a gender-balanced workforce , with 50 percent women and 50 percent men, by 2025. The company also plans to increase the percentage of women in managing director roles to at least 25 percent worldwide by 2020.   Accenture has also conducted research on closing the gender pay gap. Its latest report, Getting to Equal , reveals that today’s female university students in developed markets could be the first generation in history to see the gender pay gap close in their professional lifetimes.
