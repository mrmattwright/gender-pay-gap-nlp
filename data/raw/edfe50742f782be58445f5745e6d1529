McLaughlin & Harvey Construction Limited
Gender Pay Gap Report
2017 

Introduction 

At McLaughlin & Harvey Construction Limited we value our people 
and the contribution they make to the successful delivery of our 
projects.  We pay them fairly for the work they do, creating a working 
environment where there are equal opportunities for each employee 
irrespective of their gender.  This can be seen in all our processes and 
policies, ensuring opportunities are fair and equitable for all.

Operating throughout the UK we employ over 370 staff, with a 
turnover of £200 million per year.  Of our workforce, 58 employees 
work for the waste management business.

This report details the gender pay gap reporting requirements 
covered under The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017.  The regulations require companies with more than 
250 employees to publish information on gender pay gap.

We are an equal pay employer where a male or female performing the 
same job in the company receive the same pay. The gender pay gap 
shows the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and 
women across the workforce. This is not the same as equal pay.

Our key (cid:31) ndings

There is a gender pay gap which for a construction business would not 
be unusual as a large number of our employees are quali(cid:31) ed in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related disciplines.  
The number of women studying or working in these disciplines is 
signi(cid:31) cantly less than the number of men which results in females 
being under-represented  within the construction industry.  

A higher proportion of females working in our business ful(cid:31) l
roles of functional support which are typically lower paid than
quali(cid:31) ed occupations.

Bonus opportunities are available equally to male and female employees.

Bridging the gap

We continue to recognise the need to increase the number of females 
we employ to improve our gender balance and become a more diverse 
workforce.

It will take time to close the gender pay gap however we are 
committed to building a more diverse workforce and will continue to 
deliver new initiatives to improve how we attract, engage and develop 
women, and other under-represented groups.

We actively work with secondary schools before the students choose 
their subjects, making them aware of the exciting opportunities and 
wide variety of job roles within the construction industry.  Through this 
partnership approach and STEM engagement we believe this will open 
up opportunities for students in the construction industry that they 
may not previously have thought existed.

Each year we invest in education and training, including our 
apprenticeship, traineeship and graduate opportunities developing 
the talent of Engineers, Quantity Surveyors and other Construction 
Professionals.  Our focus is on encouraging more females into 
careers in STEM disciplines through our educational partnerships 
using females already employed in the business as STEM 
Ambassadors in our local schools.
 
In 2017 we rolled out an initiative ‘Be Fair’ which helped us promote 
equality and diversity within our organisation under the banner of 
fairness, inclusion and respect.
