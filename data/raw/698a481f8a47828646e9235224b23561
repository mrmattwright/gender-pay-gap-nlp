The UK government has introduced a requirement on all employers to publish their gender pay gap by April 2018, based on data at the end of April 2017. The new government reporting rules require us to identify differences in pay between male and female colleagues across the entire workforce regardless of job role.  The gender pay gap measures the difference between men and women's average earnings per hour and is expressed as a percentage of men's pay. According to the Office for National Statistics, the overall UK gender pay gap is currently 18.1%. Our mean Gender Pay Gap is only 3.3%. This is not the same as an "equal pay gap" which measures the pay for males and females doing the same work. At Staffline we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business.  The causes of a gender pay gap can be a complex and shifting mix of factors including work, society and family, but by monitoring the pay gap between men and women we can better understand the gap and so target action to reduce it.
