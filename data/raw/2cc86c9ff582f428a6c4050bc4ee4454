The UK government has introduced a requirement that all employers publish their gender pay ratio for 
their UK businesses with over 250 employees by April 2018. Two Smith & Nephew businesses meet 
this reporting criteria, but  to ensure we fully understand the situation at Smith & Nephew we have 
analysed the gender pay data for all our UK employees. 

Smith  &  Nephew  is  committed  to  being  a  company  that  values  difference,  and  where  employment 
practices are based upon equality of opportunity, regardless of factors that are unrelated to the ability 
of the person to perform the essential functions of the job. 

Our UK gender gap results  

Today, our overall gender pay gap is greater than we would like. Our mean pay gap for the UK is 29%1 
and median gap is 15%2. There are two main reasons for this:  

• 

First, we are a global business headquartered in the UK and a high proportion of our senior 
executives are based in the UK and are predominantly male, including our two most senior and 
highly paid positions, our CEO Olivier Bohuon and CFO Graham Baker. 

•  Second, we have more men than women in senior positions overall.  

It is important to note that this gender pay gap measures average pay rates of men and women across 
our UK employees and does not mean that we are paying male employees more than female employees 
for  doing  the  same  job  or  work  of  equal  value.  Our  internal  pay  ranges,  pay  practices  and  bonus 
structures are gender neutral and our performance management reviews are undertaken on the basis 
of objective criteria. 

Beneath the most senior management level the gap narrows considerably; mean gap is reduced to 18% 
and median gap down to 14%. 

Actions underway 

While we believe that all our employees are paid fairly for the role that they do, we recognise that more 
work is needed to improve the gender pay gap and are addressing the factors that contribute to this in 
our workforce, including:  

•  Developing our female leaders through programmes such as “Elevate”, which more than 275 
female professionals attended in 2017. Elevate has been highly successful, with the majority of 
participants stating  they prioritise making time to attend the monthly webinar sessions and 
more than one-third promoted or changed roles in the past year. 

• 

Improving promotion and recruitment processes to reduce gender-bias, improving female 
representation  on  succession  planning  and  delivering  inclusivity  training  for  managers  to 
reduce possible gender bias. 

•  Continuing to expand our Diversity and Inclusion programmes and to identify immediate 
areas and opportunities to close the gender pay gap, as well as taking these principles further 
to outside of UK and reviewing regional and global opportunities. 

 

Additional reporting 

The data disclosed herein includes all relevant3 employees in the UK as of 5 April 2017.  Smith & Nephew 
has two entities in the UK with more than 250 employees which it is required to report gender pay data 
for: T.J. Smith and Nephew, Limited and Smith & Nephew UK Limited. The data for these two entities is 
included within the overall Smith & Nephew UK gender pay results. It is also shown below by entity as 
submitted to the gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk website. 

All of our UK-based senior executives are included in the Smith & Nephew UK Limited dataset. We 
believe that the overall UK employee data as reported above is representative of Smith & Nephew in 
the UK.
