We publish these results on our own website and submit the figures to the government by 4th April each year.  We use these results to assess:   the level of gender equality in our workplace;  the balance of male and female employees at different levels;  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.   The Pioneer Academy is committed to the promotion of equality of opportunity and choice for employees and supports the fair treatment of all staff irrespective of gender through our transparent recruitment processes, pay policy, and professional development.
