These include care homes for older people, children's services, learning and physical disability services, as well as help and support for those with mental health needs.  The aim of United Health is to be recognised as one of the best providers of quality facilities and services. We always want to be aware of and open to new ideas and methods, and to develop our resources to meet the increasing demands and care expectations of a growing and ever more discerning population. We constantly review the performance and standards of all our services, to ensure we continually deliver the best care we can.  Our approach to delivering care is consistent no matter what type of service we provide. We believe all the help and support we give should be tailored to the particular needs of a resident or service user. We take time to understand an individual’s care requirements, wishes and choices. We also get to know their personalities, their likes and dislikes. Only in this way can we deliver the very best care possible.  Of course, this doesn’t happen by chance. Supporting our vision, and delivering our services, are a number of hugely dedicated and highly trained staff teams. Their professionalism is complemented by empathy, compassion and a determination to provide all our service users with the opportunity to enjoy life to the best of their ability. In order to maintain this high quality approach we conduct regular audits, staff training, communication reviews and appraisals, so that each member of our team is equipped to deliver the care that everyone accessing our services deserves.  As an organisation we are aware of the changing trends in independent living, supported housing and health care. We are keen to develop new initiatives through business partnership in order to offer innovative and comprehensive schemes that fully address the needs of local communities, delivering a range of care services wherever appropriate.  When delivering care and support we believe in doing more than the minimum required. We recognise the importance of everyone who uses our services; their opinions and comments are important to us. We constantly ask for feedback so that we can ensure that we always meet their expectations.  We hope this website provides you with useful information and helps you in making the right choices for your family and loved ones.
