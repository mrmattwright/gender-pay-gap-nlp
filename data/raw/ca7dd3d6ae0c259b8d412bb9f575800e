The Gender Pay Gap data provides the difference between the  average earnings of men and women across an organisation, expressed as a  percentage of men’s earnings. The use of Gender Pay Gap data can help to  identify the extent to which men and women undertake different types of roles,  at different levels within the organisation, which can also create differences  in pay. It is different to Equal Pay data which considers rates of pay for the  same level of work.  The data provided below relates to University of Worcester’s Gender Pay Gap report for 2017 taken on  the snapshot date of 31 March  2017.    Employment mix within the pay quartiles  At the University of Worcester 65% of our employees are female , and this level of representation  exists throughout the organisation, from the lowest grades to the highest.  It is encouraging to see from our quartile data (the split of  employees into four groups by hourly rate, to show the balance of men and women  in each group) that women make up over  63% of employees across all four quartiles .  This data is indicative of the University’s inclusive  approach in all areas of work and the value it places on female employees at  all levels.  For more than two decades, women have made up more than 50%  of the University’s Executive leadership, a philosophy first introduced by  former Principal, Dorma Urwin, and one to which the current Vice Chancellor,  Professor David Green, who has led the Institution for the past 15 years,  remains committed.     Mean Pay  The mean is calculated by adding all employees’ hourly rates of pay  together and dividing by the total number of employees. The mean includes the  lowest and highest rates of pay.  The average hourly  rate paid to women at the University, when looking at hourly rates across all  pay bands, is 3.16% less than the  hourly rate for men - this is the mean gender pay gap. This is amongst the lowest for universities, and well below the national mean gender pay gap of 17.4% (ONS  Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2017).  Similar to other organisations, the University employs a  higher proportion of women in lower graded roles, for example, our team of cleaners,  of whom 85% are women and 15% are men. Having a high percentage of females in  roles where there are large numbers of staff contributes to the pay gap shown  in our data.     Median Pay  The median is the measurement used to  calculate the average pay, by finding the midpoint in all employees’ hourly  rates of pay. Therefore, half of the employees will earn a rate above the  midpoint and half will earn a rate below the midpoint.  The median gender  pay gap at the University is 11%, which is lower than the national figure of  18.4% (ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2017).  Bonus Pay  The University operates a staff reward scheme. This provides  an opportunity for staff to apply for an incremental pay increase or a one off  payment in recognition of outstanding work which has contributed towards the  University’s strategic aims. Applications are assessed on a fair and equal  basis, by an independent panel.  The data relating to bonus pay for the Gender Pay Gap  analysis reflects one off bonus payments made through our reward schemes and  relates to the 12 months reference period to 31 March 2017.  The total spend on these bonus payments is small when compared  with the University’s total spend on salaries and the number of staff involved is  comparatively small; 6% of male  employees received a bonus in 2017 and 5% of female employees received a bonus.  In 2017, women received a higher average bonus payment than  men, and the mean gender bonus gap is -11%.  The median gender  bonus gap is 37%, this represents a difference of average amounts received in  bonus payments of £300 for women compared to £475 for men.  Moving forward  At the University of Worcester we are committed to inclusion  and the promotion of gender equality.  Our  gender pay gap data demonstrates that we have good foundations in place and  that women are well represented at all levels within our organisation.  Moving forward, we will continue to keep our HR policies and  processes under regular review to ensure we are making steps towards removing  any existing gender pay gap and ensuring that there is a balanced representation of  different genders within the workforce and across all roles.  We will continue to monitor the employment ‘lifecycle’ of our  staff;  from initial recruitment ensuring  that we have fair and consistent selection processes; having career development  opportunities open for all job roles; clear and consistent promotion and salary  processes; fair and flexible working practices.
