UK gender pay gap report
2017
Gender pay gap explained
A gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. It is the description given to the difference in average pay between all men  
and all women across an organisation regardless of role or grade level. 
A company reporting a positive pay gap means its male employees, on average, are paid more than its female ones. A 
company reporting a negative pay gap means its female employees are paid more than its male ones on average.
Equal pay is a direct comparison between individuals. It considers whether an individual is paid equivalently to other 
employees doing the same or equivalent work regardless of gender. Unequal pay is unlawful.

Our 2017 UK pay gap data

“We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to provide 
greater transparency and dialogue on the subject of gender 
pay. Fairness in our pay practices including equal pay for 
equal work is fundamental in our pay philosophy.
GSK has a long-standing commitment to equal and 
inclusive treatment of all employees. We have been 
making progress towards increasing gender diversity  
and are seeing a steady rise in the percentage of women 
in senior positions. 

Our results show a pay gap of 2.81% which is a 
significantly smaller gap than the UK national average. 
However, there are no grounds for complacency. Our 
ongoing commitment to increase gender diversity at all 
levels in our organisation and to fair and equitable pay 
practices will continue.”  

 
Simon Dingemans, Chief Financial Officer

The new UK legislation asks for calculations based on data collected on 5 April 2017. For a comprehensive picture of the gender 
pay analysis, the data below reflects all GSK permanent full and part time UK-based employees across all our legal entities.

Pay quartiles
Pay quartiles show the distribution of earnings when looking at pay. The workforce is divided into four equal groups ranging 
from the lowest to highest paid individuals. It shows the proportion of male and female employees in each quartile.

Bonus pay
All our permanent employees in the UK are eligible for an 
annual bonus. 
Our mean bonus gap is bigger than our overall gender pay 
gap. The government’s definition of bonus pay here includes 
long term incentives (LTI) which applies to eligible employees 
in our leadership population. Bonus and LTI value increases 
with grade. A higher percentage of our executive leaders are 
male which is why the bonus gap is bigger than our overall 
gender pay gap. 
Although there is a higher proportion of men to women at the 
most senior levels, we also have a significant proportion of 
men at the lowest pay bands who receive lower bonuses

(see quartile diagram above). This results in the bonus median 
for men being pulled downwards, to a point below the midpoint 
for women. 
Note: The bonus pay gap is based on actual payments 
received with the pro-rating of bonus calculations for part 
time workers. Pro-ration is a contributing factor to the size 
of the reported bonus gap as the majority of our part time 
workers are women.

Services Unlimited, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (UK) Trading Limited  (joint venture with Novartis) (“Consumer

Our Consumer Healthcare business in the UK comprises 
1,209 employees (from our total GSK UK population of 
over 13,000 employees). Women represent 39% of the 
Consumer Healthcare workforce. 
The workforce profile shows that there is a large volume of 
men in manufacturing roles which tend to be at relatively 
lower grades and salaries. There are 70% men in the lower 
quartile and 65% in the lower middle quartile and this is 
the key factor behind why the base pay mean (-4.48%) and 

median (-17.09%) gaps are in favour of women. It is also 
the same dynamic that causes the median bonus to be 
-38.06% in favour of women. Conversely, the mean bonus 
gap 26.78% reflects the influence of the global and regional 
leadership level of Consumer Healthcare in the UK, where 
more senior positions are held by men. 
More information about our commitments and progress on 
inclusion and diversity can be found in the People section of 
our Responsible Business Supplement.

All calculations follow the specified methodology set out in the UK Government legislation. The mean and median salary analysis is reported before salary 
sacrifice payments were removed.
