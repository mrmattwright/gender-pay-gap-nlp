This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee’s data. We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. We can use these results to assess: the levels of gender equality in our workplace the balance of male and female employees at different levels how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded. The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap. Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing HR and payroll records. All employees can confirm and update their records if they choose to by contacting Mrs Charlotte Carter, HR Manager.
