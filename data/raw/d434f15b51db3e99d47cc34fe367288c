How we’re changing the game

Founded in 2001, Sky Betting and Gaming have a clear mission to Make Betting 
and Gaming Better. We do this by being customer obsessed, with a high focus on 
quality, and investing in our brand, technology and people to deliver continuous 
improvement. We are aiming to be the UK’s best digital business.

At SB&G we recognise the value 
of a diverse and gender balanced 
workforce. As of April ’17, our gender 
split was 81% male and 19% female. 
We understand that as a technology 
business within the gambling sector, 
our challenge is to increase our 
gender balance at all levels within our 
organisation. We have undertaken 
analysis to understand what is driving 
our gender pay gap and based on this 
we believe the gap is predominantly 
a result of lower representation of 
females at our senior levels.

What are we doing?

Our diversity strategy is to make SBG ‘a 
place where everyone and anyone can 
be themselves and thrive’. 
We have launched a number of 
initiatives that we hope will kick start 

our commitment to addressing the 
gender imbalance within the business.
This Gender Pay Gap report is a timely 
reminder of the need to focus on this 
important issue.

What is the Gender Pay Gap?

Gender Pay Gap reporting requires employers with more than 250 employees 
to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is 
between their male and female employees.

This is different to ‘equal pay’, which is 
the difference in pay between men  
and women who carry out the same  
or similar jobs. 
Our calculations are based on:

•  Mean hourly pay: an average 
calculation of the sum of male 
employees hourly pay divided by  
the number of male employees.  
The same formula is applied to 
female and a percentage gap 
between the two is calculated. 

•  Median hourly pay: A calculation 

which takes all salaries in a sample, 
lines them up from lowest to highest 
and picking the middle-most salary. 
This is done for males and females 
in isolation and a percentage gap 
between the two is calculated.
