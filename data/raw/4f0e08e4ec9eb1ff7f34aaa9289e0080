Hourly Rate Gap        On average women are paid 28% less than men in our UK (excluding N.l.) workforce. We are confident that women and men are largely paid the same for comparable roles and that the fact that more men hold more senior posts accounts for the overall difference in average earnings evident in this disclosure.  Note that the value of any car allowance paid has been included in the hourly rate gaps calculation; however the value of any company cars has been excluded, per the legislative reporting guidelines. As a result, those who elect to have a company car do not have their benefit represented in their hourly rate calculation, creating disparity with car allowance recipients. Proportionally, more women than men elect to have a company car over a cash allowance, so average numbers for women are more adversely influenced compared to the average for men.      Bonus Gap        Looking specifically at the bonus gap difference between men and women, the difference is relatively high at 50%. This is mostly driven by the structural dimensions of our workforce as noted above; more men are in senior positions and senior positions attract higher performance bonuses.       Proportion of males and females in each quartile band        The population is divided into four equal parts or ‘quartiles’, from the lowest paid to the highest paid based on the calculated hourly pay rate. This breakdown of hourly rates by defined quartiles reflects the gender differences in our workforce, where the upper quartile of hourly paid rates is male dominated (62 percent versus 38 percent), whilst the opposite is true for women where they dominate the lower hourly paid rate quartile (68 percent versus 32 percent). In other words, there is a greater proportion of men in higher paid quartiles and a greater proportion of women in lower paid quartiles.      Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus           This graphic illustrates that 96% of men and 92% of women received a bonus payment in the 12 months leading up to April 5 th 2017.       I confirm the data reported is accurate.  Boston Scientific Limited  /s/ Mark R. Slicer Mark R.
