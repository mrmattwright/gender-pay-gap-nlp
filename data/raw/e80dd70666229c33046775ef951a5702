We welcome both the Public Sector Equality Duty and the NHS Equality Delivery System.  We are determined that both will result in real outcomes and practical improvements in the day-to-day life and experience of all those who come into contact with our services. Our aim is to:   help everyone, whoever they are, to receive high quality health careÂ  recognise and celebrate the fact that every person is an individualÂ  make sure every person is treated with dignity and respect.   Our staff are highly motivated, skilled and come from a diverse range of backgrounds.Â Placing a real value onÂ  diversity not only enables Newcastle Hospitals to recruit and retain the best staff, but ensures we deliver outcomes and improvements to service delivery.    What is Equality and Diversity? Show [+] Hide [-]  Although sometimes used interchangeably, the terms âequalityâ and âdiversityâ are not the same.  Equality is about making sure everyone is treated fairly and given the same life opportunities. It is not about treating everyone the same way, to achieve the same outcomes people may need to be treated differently.  Diversity means âdifference.â When it is used in the same context as âequalityâ, it is about recognising and valuing individual as well as group differences. It also means treating people as individuals and placing positive value on diversity both within the community and the workforce.  The Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is committed to making high quality healthcare available to all the communities it serves and working in partnership with other organizations.   We are dedicated to delivering a quality service to all people irrespective of race; sexual orientation; age; disability; religion or belief, gender, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity status.  However the Trust can only provide the best possible care for our patients if we also recognise and meet the diverse needs of our staff. Our aim is to treat all staff as valued and respected individuals and to support equal access to opportunities for development within the Trust.  Our aim is for Equality, Diversity and Human Rights issues to feature in our everyday thinking rather than being an 'added extra'.  We have people and groups who have a role in promoting Equality, Diversity and Human Rights in all the work we do.   Health, Equality and Wellbeing Committee Show [+] Hide [-]  The Health, Equality and Wellbeing Committee's main objectives are to ensure the Trust is compliant with national and local legislation, initiatives, policies and standards and to ensure that involvement and equality is embedded at every level within the organisation.Â   Equality, Diversity and Human Rights Group Show [+] Hide [-]  Working in partnership with staff, third sector organisations and other health and public organisations, the group aims to develop, promote and implement best Equality, Diversity and Human Rights practice within the Trust  The Group supports the Newcastle Hospitals to comply with Government Policy and the legal requirements by driving forward and monitoring the objectives within the Equality Strategy and subsequent Equality Delivery System.   Equality and Diversity Board Report Show [+] Hide [-]  The Newcastle Hospitals report formally to the Trust Board every year on equality and diversity issues.  These reports provide a summary of equality and diversity information and work that has been done over the last 12 months or planned for the future.   Equality Delivery System - The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Show [+] Hide [-]  The Equality Delivery System (EDS) has been developed by the NHS for the NHS.Â  It has been designed to specifically support service-delivery that is fair, providing equality of access and delivery of services that meet the needs of a diverse population.Â The national framework allows the Trust to assess how we are performing with regard to equality, diversity and human rights, and how we can improve.Â It sets out our commitment to taking equality and human rights into everything we do, whether thatâs providing services, employing people, developing policies, communicating, consulting or involving people in our work. It also incorporates the General and Public Duties within the Equality Act 2010.  It builds on previous work to develop the Race Equality Scheme, Disability Equality Scheme and Gender Equality Scheme -Â all previously published on our website.Â In addition, the Equality Strategy addresses all equality strands as required by the Equality Act 2010.
