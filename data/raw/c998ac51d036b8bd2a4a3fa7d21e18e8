All companies that employ more than 250 employees are required to report their gender pay gap under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it does not involve publishing information about individual employees.  The following report has been produced in compliance with the regulations and the results are based upon the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.Â  At that time Radis Community Care was comprised of two separate entities, County Home Care Services Ltd and GP Homecare Ltd.Â  The results for both have been published on the Government website.Â  County Home Care Services employs Care/Support Workers and branch based office staff.Â  GP Homecare also employs Care/Support Workers and branch based office staff as well as the Support Team (Comms. & Business Development, Contracts, Finance, Group Recruitment, HR, IT, Quality Assurance, Training, Operational Managers and Directors).

We are proud of the fact that the proportion of women we employ at all job levels mirrors the composition of our workforce as a whole.Â  We have always encouraged staff to develop their careers with Radis and opportunities for development and promotion are open to all regardless of gender, race, age, disability, marital status, religion or belief.Â  Radisâ€™ Board is 50% male, 50% female.  If you have any questions about gender pay gap reporting please speak with your Manager in the first instance.  I confirm that the data reported is accurate as of the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.
