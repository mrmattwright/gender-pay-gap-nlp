pride ourselves on our diverse workforce, which we believe leads to a more
rewarding and successful workplace.       At Salmon, we strive to create a working environment where everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. We pride ourselves on our diverse workforce, which we believe leads to a more rewarding and successful workplace. But we understand there is more we need to do and Salmon is focused on a number of initiatives to further improve our gender diversity across the organisation. What is The Gender Pay Gap? Gender Pay Gap reporting is now a UK regulatory requirement for all companies with over 250 employees. The first wave of reports from over 9,000 companies must be published no later than 4th April 2018, based on data as at 5th April 2017. The Gender Pay Gap regulatory reporting provides details of the gender and remuneration distribution across an organisation. The figure measures the difference between the average earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of their role or seniority within the organisation. How is The Gender Pay Gap different from Equal Pay? The Gender Pay Gap looks at the mean and median pay regardless of the roles performed. As different jobs pay different salaries and the number of men and women performing these jobs varies, a marginal gender pay gap will almost always exist. This is different from Equal Pay , which is the difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs.  The statistics contained in this report do not represent Equal Pay status. What is the Mean and Median Gap? The Mean Pay Gap is the average. The mean pay gap is the difference in the average hourly rate of pay between all men and women. The Median Pay Gap is the middle. To explain this, imagine that all employees were lined up in a female line and a male line, from lowest to highest in terms of rate of pay. The female and male in the middle of each line are compared. This is what gives us the media gender pay gap. results Salmon UK has fewer women at a senior leadership level and we also have a lower representation of women within our more technically orientated roles, where pay tends to be higher, and subsequently we have a gender pay gap across the higher paid quartiles of our submission. Salmon UK’s median gender pay gap as at 5th April 2017 was 23.8%, which we note is below the technology industry average of 25% (source: Office of National Statistics). It is however above the UK-wide, cross-sector average of 18.4%. (source: Office of National Statistics) You can see our full figures below:               We recognise our responsibilities in remediating any disparity illustrated within this report. Salmon are taking proactive and immediate measures to achieve a better level of gender diversity across the group:  Taking positive action to attract and recruit women to Salmon by attending women-related IT events Introduction of additional and specialised training for senior women in the business Review of our recruitment advertising and job descriptions to ensure we are not imposing barriers to gender diversity Unconscious Bias Training for the UK Leadership team Increasing the visbility and voices of women across the organisation Promoting female thought leadership across social media and digital channels Adoption of family friendly policies We are confident that these initiatives will start to address gender pay gap issues, with more to follow. STATEMENT We confirm that the information in this report is accurate and prepared in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
