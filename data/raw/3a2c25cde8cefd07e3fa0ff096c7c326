Introduction

Equality, diversity and inclusion lie at the heart of all Lancaster University activity and we are very proud of our work in this 
area. As part of our Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategic Vision 2020, we commit to:
‘Achieve balanced diversity profile across all areas and levels and in the membership of University Committees’
‘Attract under-represented groups, such as females and Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) to apply for senior positions.’
‘Ensure on-going equal pay for work of equal value across all University roles and diversity groups, substantiated by regular 
Equal Pay Audit and implementation of actions.’
In line with the University’s values, the People Strategy 2020 also includes a strong commitment to equality, diversity and 
inclusion, and implicit in this is our commitment to addressing the gender pay gap.

Background to the report

The Gender Pay Gap is a product of the distribution of female and male staff across the whole grade structure from the 
lowest (starting at Grade 1) to the highest senior and professorial grades. The new Gender Pay Gap reporting obligations 
have been introduced alongside the existing Public Sector Equality Duty. 

In relation to the Gender Pay Gap, this duty requires us to publish the following information by 31 March annually:

• Difference in hourly rate of pay – mean (%)
• Difference in hourly rate of pay – median (%)
• Difference in bonus pay – mean (%)
• Difference in bonus pay – median (%)
• Percentage of women and men who received bonus pay
• Percentage of employees by each pay quartile

We recognise that there are key areas to be addressed to reduce our Gender Pay Gap and will continue to work, through 
our membership of Athena SWAN charter which promotes gender equality in higher education, and our wider equality, 
diversity and inclusion work to do this.

An important part of the context here at Lancaster, and a key contributing factor to 4 % of the overall mean gender pay 
gap, is the fact we employ our own cleaning and catering staff. This is something we are proud of and it contributes to us 
consistently winning awards for the quality of our campus and the quality services we provide to our staff and students. 
Many other universities and local organisations contract out these services. There are over 200 such staff employed in 
Grade 1 part-time positions, 85% of whom are female, with Grade 1 being the lowest grade in the pay scales. The rate 
of pay for cleaning staff is consistently around 10% higher than the local market rate for these roles and the evidence 
suggests that Lancaster has some of the best paid (alongside a very full and competitive set of terms and conditions of 
employment) cleaning and facilities staff in the region.

In addition the University operates a scheme to provide internal temporary employment opportunities to our students to 
support their future employability. This reduces our spending on agency workers and increases student employment, but 
as a direct consequence, it also means that we have a higher than average number of variable hours workers of a different 
demographic profile.

Key actions
•  We have a comprehensive action plan outlining the positive action we’ll take in terms of recruitment, removal of 
identified barriers to career progression and an overall target to improve the ratio of Female  
to Male staff across all grades. These actions are derived from rigorous equality impact assessment  
of policies and practices, and are connected to the University’s institutional Athena SWAN charter award for gender 
equality. 
•  Equal Pay Audits are conducted on a regular basis (2010, 2014 and 2017) to measure pay differences within grade. 
The aim of this is to identify and correct any bias in our pay and grade structures and their application within each grade 
across gender and other diversity groups such as age groups, those with/without a disability and in different ethnic 
groups for UK and non-UK staff.
•  We safeguard equal pay at Lancaster through a consistent and transparent analytical framework: Higher Education Role 
Analysis (HERA) job evaluation for Grades 1-9 (across all categories of staff), and schemes for senior staff grades and 
professorial pay, in which internal and external scrutiny is applied.
•  The gender pay gap across all grades has been annually reviewed to determine differences between female and male 
average (mean and median) hourly pay.

The pay gap at Lancaster

At Lancaster, the mean gender pay gap is 27.7% (female lower than male) and the median gender pay gap is 26.5%.

Across the Higher Education sector and Pre-92 universities the mean gender pay gap was 17.8% (HE sector) and 19.2% 
(Pre-92) and the median gender pay gap was 13.7% (HE sector) and 16.2% (Pre-92). in 2016-17. However, there are 
limitations to sector comparisons due to differences in staff profiles as set out above.

The mean bonus gap at Lancaster is 21.5% (female higher than male) and the median bonus gap is 48.1%.

6.1% of female staff received bonus, whilst 2.7% of male staff received bonus.

There are 2 types of payments to staff that apply to the definition of bonus, and have been included in these calculations:

•  ‘Ex-gratia’ payments of up to £1,000 to staff who have met the criteria for  
exceptional performance.

•  Annual Celebratory Staff Awards, with individuals and teams being nominated for outstanding  
achievement, and successful awards attracting a payment of £1,000.

The tables below show that there is a higher concentration of female staff in the lower grades and a lower concentration of 
female staff for the higher grades for both Professional Services staff and for Academic, Research and Teaching staff. The 
University recognises that these are major contributors to the gender pay gap and is committed to resolving them.

LANCASTER IS WORKING 
TO CLOSE THE GAP

Lancaster is working to close the gap and has already taken a number of actions and has agreed further  
priority actions, which are being progressed through the Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategic Vision 2020 
and its action plan:

•  Fully developed action plans, which aim to meet the strategic objectives to create a 50-50 distribution 

of female / male staff across the whole grade structure, and thereby close the gender pay gap.  
This includes a new 4-year Athena SWAN Action Plan, which includes specific targets for improvement.

•  Positive action in recruitment to attract greater diversity, supported by guidance on best practice is 
now in place. This includes research undertaken to identify gendered language used in job adverts,  
in order to break down occupational segregation.

•  Our academic staff promotions criteria have recently been reviewed again to ensure continued 

recognition of all activities, to ensure all aspects of academic activity are recognised when making 
promotion based decisions.

•  Enhanced pay and direct support before, during and after maternity, adoption, parental and shared 

parental leave is now being promoted and offered.

•  Improving and promoting flexible working practices and enhanced support for staff  

with caring responsibilities.

•  On-campus Pre-school Centre and school holiday clubs and activities are available to 

meet childcare needs of our staff and to help facilitate the further embedding of our flexible  
working policies and practices.

•  Training for managers is in place to support the implementation of equality diversity and inclusion 
objectives, including preventing the adverse effects of unconscious bias in decision making  
(including the recruitment and selection of staff).

•  A new 4-year Athena SWAN Action Plan, which aims to make real progress to reduce the  

Gender Pay Gap, as a fundamental part of the Athena SWAN charter work.
