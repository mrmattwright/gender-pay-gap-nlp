We’ve been around a while, we were born in the golden age of the 1950s; when children roamed the streets with a skip in their steps, Elvis’ hips were causing a stir and the American Navy had developed one of the first computers which stored around 1/8th of a megabytes worth of data and took up approximately 16.5 rooms (the other half was taken up by essential coffee making facilities).  Along with the rest of the world we have transcended into full technicolour and over the last 50 years, although we have grown and evolved - and our computers take up slightly less space - we have kept our core values – to build a company we can be proud of!  So, what are we proud of I hear you say?  •	Every aspect of product development is managed in-house and when we say every aspect we mean it – a number of our games are unique to us, we actively encourage staff to be involved from the ideas stage through to the implementation of the games, to push the boundaries of new technologies and overall give our customers the best experience possible.  •	We’re responsible and honest – we encourage low-stake play rather than influence greater spend. We want to look after our existing players and make them feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  •	Many of our competitors are part of a network and share prize funds- at tombola, all prizes are only available at our site.  •	The community we create for our players is award winning, we keep the trophies on a shelf in the 1st floor toilets so people can practice their acceptance speeches in the mirror. We also work very hard to create an in-house community which provides a fun and relaxed working environment for employees.
