Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

 

 
Foreword by Karen Nightingall, Director, People and Capability 
 
This report is an important part of seeking assurance on the equality of our 
pay systems, and for helping us to understand and address any emerging 
issues in relation to gender. It will support our ongoing work to improve the 
diversity of our workforce and reform our overall reward offering. 
 
HSE is committed to building and maintaining a diverse and inclusive 
organisation with equality of opportunity at the heart of this.  We have made 
significant progress in modernising our reward strategy to enable everyone in 
HSE to be recognised individually regardless of grade or gender.  Some 
recent improvements include: 

 

 

  The introduction of spot rates for our junior grades to enable consistent 

movement through pay ranges.   

  Reducing the length of our pay ranges generally to an average length 

of approximately 10% with aspirations to go further.  This will help 
enable us to address any remaining variation in pay for similar roles.  

  Reforming bonus awards so that they are paid as a set value as 

opposed to a percentage of salary, and are no longer prorated for part-
time staff.  This ensures equality of payment regardless of grade, 
gender or contracted hours. 
Introduction of a new in-year reward and recognition scheme. The 
distribution of these payments will be carefully monitored to ensure 
equality.  

 

  Taking steps to improve how we recruit women into senior and higher 

paid specialist roles including the introduction of anonymised 
recruitment, and ensuring gender balance on selection panels.  

There is clearly scope for us to make further improvements, particularly in the 
proportion of women employed in senior posts and specialist technical and 
engineering roles which are amongst our most highly paid jobs.  Attracting 
female engineers is a challenge we share with the wider UK economy and it is 
an unavoidable fact that fewer women are currently employed in these 
sectors.   

Together with my HSE Management Board colleagues, we are fully 
committed to improving further our position in relation to gender pay.

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

 

 
Introduction  
 
Earlier this year, the Government introduced world-leading legislation that 
made it statutory for organisations with 250 or more employees to report 
annually on their gender pay gap. Government departments are covered by 
the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 
2017 which came into force on 31 March 2017. These regulations underpin 
the Public Sector Equality Duty and require the relevant organisations to 
publish their gender pay gap data by 30 March 2018 (and then annually), 
including mean and median gender pay gaps; the mean and median gender 
bonus gaps; the proportion of men and women who received bonuses; and 
the proportions of male and female employees in each pay quartile.  
  
The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men 
and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay 
gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with, and the 
individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are. 
  
The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay 
differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar 
jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because 
they are a man or a woman.  
 
The Health and Safety Executive supports the fair treatment and reward of all 
staff irrespective of gender.   
 
This report sets out where the Health and Safety Executive fulfils the reporting 
requirements, analyses the figures in more detail and sets out what we are 
doing to close the gender pay gap in the organisation.

Definitions and scope 

The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the mean or median 
hourly rate of pay that male and female colleagues receive.  

 
The mean pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings of men 
and women. 

 
The median pay gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of 
hourly earnings of men and women. It takes all salaries in the sample, lines 
them up in order from lowest to highest, and picks the middle-most salary.  

 
The report is based on rates of pay as at 31 March 2017 and bonuses paid in 
the year 1 April 2016 – 31 March 2017. It includes all workers in scope at 31 
March 2017.

Summary of results 
 
The results show that HSE has a mean gender pay gap of 22.93% and a 
median gender pay gap of 25.97%.  We are confident that this is not an equal 
pay issue – there is equal treatment for work of equal or similar value – and 
when we examine gender pay by grading level the gap becomes much 
narrower, particularly at senior levels.  The pay gap is negligible within Senior 
Civil Service (SCS) grades and for HSE Board members there is no gender 
pay gap at all.   

 
The is also a relatively small gap in our senior professional and operational 
roles (Band 1 and Band 2 level) where the mean pay gap is 5.8% and the 
median 3.9%. 

Encouragingly for the future, there is a negligible pay gap at Band 4 level 
which is the entry grade for our trainee Health and Safety inspectors, and a 
middle management level for our scientific roles and corporate services. 

Within our junior grades (where we have made significant pay reforms) the 
pay gap is in favour of women.    

We have a specific issue at Band 3 level which has the widest gender pay 
gap (12.5%). The majority of our specialist inspectors are employed at this 
grade and many of these roles require specific technical and engineering 
skills and experience and therefore attract a pay premium. The make-up of 
this group reflects the wider industry picture (and our main recruitment 
market) where relatively small numbers of women are employed.  When we 
examine particular specialisms, however, we are confident that HSE pays 
equally for similar skills, for example the relative pay gap between male and 
female engineers is negligible. 

Overall, the analysis shows that a key factor in the gender pay gap for HSE is 
that there are fewer women working in specialist, technical and engineering 
roles which attract higher levels of pay (33% of our people in specialist roles 
are women).

Further analysis 
 
A further breakdown of HSE data for 2017 shows that across specific peer 
groups (grading level), the gender pay gap is far less pronounced. 
 
Note –  
All figures in the tables below are rounded to one decimal place. 
A minus figure shows pay in favour of women. 
 
 
Proportion of men and women at each grading level 
 
Overall, HSE employs an equal proportion of men (1368) and women (1356).   
See Table 1.  Women predominate the lower grades (Bands 4 – 6) with the 
proportion of men employed greater in the higher grades (Bands 1 -3 and 
SCS levels).

Gender pay gap at each grading level 
 
The overall mean gender pay gap is 22.93% and median gender pay gap is 
25.97%. The pay gap narrows when it is broken down by each grading level.  
See Tables 2 and 3. 
  
For our senior leadership roles within Senior Civil Service (SCS) grades, and 
Band 4 level (which is our entry grade for trainee Health and Safety 
inspectors) the gender pay gap is negligible.  For HSE Board Members there 
is no gender pay gap.  The pay gap is in favour of women for Bands 5 and 6.  
 
The gap is less pronounced in other senior roles at Band 1 and Band 2 level 
where the mean pay gap is up to 5.8% and the median 3.9%

Bonus Awards 
 
HSE paid bonus awards to 89% of all staff - 89.25% of men received a bonus 
payment compared to 88.72% of women. The mean bonus gap was 3.25% 
and there was no gap for the median. 
 
 
Actions 
 
HSE is committed to continuing to reduce its gender pay gap and has a range 
of initiatives in place to do this, including: 
 
Recruitment 
 

  We will review our advertising and marketing approach with a view to 
increasing the number of women recruited to specialist technical and 
engineering roles.  These roles are amongst our most highly paid jobs. 

 

In line with Cabinet Office guidance, HSE has already anonymised the 
Civil Service job application process. 
 

  Our recruitment strategy requires that all selection panels include 

female representation to ensure gender balance.   

 
 
Flexible Working 
 

  HSE is committed to delivering its business more effectively by creating 

modern workplaces, we actively promote flexible working to support 
employees with caring responsibilities and encourage work-life balance 
and wellbeing.  Around one third of our employees have flexible 
working arrangements. 
In order to provide parents with more flexibility in how to share time off 
work after their child is born or placed for adoption, we encourage and 
support a shared parental leave policy. 
 

 

 
Development Programmes 
 

  HSE actively promotes participation in its talent and leadership 

development programmes such as the Positive Action Pathway, open 
to colleagues from protected characteristic groups that are not 
appropriately represented in HSE.

Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 
 

  Through refreshing our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, we are aiming 

to make HSE a more inclusive and diverse environment in which to 
work. 

 
Staff Networks 
 

 

In line with the Talent Action Plan, Removing Barriers to Success, HSE 
supports four diversity staff networks, one of which is the Gender 
Equality Network.  The aim of these networks is to table a collaborative 
approach to promoting equality within the workplace.
