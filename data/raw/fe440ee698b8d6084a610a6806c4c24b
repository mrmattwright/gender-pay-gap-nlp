GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

 

As at 31st March 2017 

 

 
Introduction to Gender Pay Reporting  

Gender Pay Gap Legislation gives a statutory requirement to all employers who have 250 or 
more employees to capture and analyse specific data and to publish an Annual Gender Pay 
Gap Report.  

 
This legislation was necessary even though 2017 has marked 42 years since the Sex 
Discrimination Act 1975 came into force making provision for Gender Equality in the work 
place. This is because women actually still face long term inequalities and are 
disadvantaged by unfair or lesser treatment. (The current relevant Gender statistics for the 
NHS as a whole can be seen in Appendix 1).  
 
The first capture of the required annual data was at the 31st March 2017. This must be both 
published transparently in a report on the Trust’s website, and specific data uploaded to a 
Government website, by March 30th 2018 and therein after annually.  
 
The Data Required by the Regulations  

Employers are required to calculate the: 
 
-   Ordinary pay - the gross hourly rate of ordinary pay relating to the pay period and then: 
 
The gender difference in the mean pay, median pay and mean bonus in the pay period  
 

-  Mean Gender Pay Gap - difference between the mean hourly rate of ordinary pay  
-  Median Gender Pay Gap - difference between the mean (and median) ordinary pay 

Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap - difference between the mean rate of bonus  

-  Median Bonus Gender Pay Gap - difference between the mean (and median) bonus 
-  Proportion of Males and Females in Each Quartile Pay Band 

 
The data in this report is accurate and is calculated using the national ESR Gender Pay Gap 
Reporting too. This tool uses the appropriate definitions, calculations and methodology. 
 
What does the report show?  

Gender Pay Gap data gives transparency about gender and pay across the Trust which can 
be benchmarked with that of National, NHS, Public Sector or other group data. It also 

 

Page 1 of 8 

  

provides further information and analysis to explain the resulting data and to detail any areas 
to address as part of demonstrating our commitment to equality.  
 
The narrative provided by the Trust in the report is extra to the statutory requirements but is 
a key part of assessing, understanding and explaining the data so that the data results are 
not misinterpreted for want of background detail.  
 
The Gender Pay Gap and Equal Pay are not the same thing  

It is important to recognise that the gender pay gap differs to equal pay. Equal pay is in 
relation to pay differences between men and women who carry out the same job for different 
pay, which is unlawful. The gender pay gap is not unlawful but shows the difference in 
average pay of all men and the average pay of all women employed by the Trust. 
 
It is possible to have genuine pay equality but still have a significant gender pay gap. 
 
A significant Gender Pay Gap could affect an organisations reputation. The data used is a 
tool for measuring career opportunities, promotions and progress for women and the wider 
the gap the more indication of inequalities and poor organisational performance for women. 
There are significant benefits and values for both genders, for an organisation and for the 
UK economy in having an equalised workforce.  
 
Terms and Conditions of Service  

The majority of staff at the Trust are on the Agenda for Change Terms and Conditions of 
Service (AfC) and the Trust uses the national job evaluation framework for AfC staff to 
determine appropriate pay bandings; this provides a clear process of paying employees 
equally for the same or equivalent work. Each grade has a set of pay points for annual 
progression, the longer period of time that someone has been in a grade the higher their 
salary is likely to be irrespective of their gender. 
 
Medical and Dental staff have different Terms and Conditions of Service, depending on their 
seniority, these are also set across a number of basic pay scales with different thresholds 
within them and like AfC they provide a clear process of paying employees equally for the 
same or equivalent work. 
 
Senior Managers such as Directors and Chief Executive have separate pay arrangements 
that are agreed by the Trust Board. 
 
As an Acute Hospital the Trust provides services 24/7 and some employees may have bank 
and permanent positions, work unsocial hours and participate in on-call rotas for which they 
receive enhanced pay in addition to their basic pay.  
 
Senior medical staff are also paid additional responsibility payments where they hold 
management positions within the Trust, such as Medical, Clinical or Divisional Directors and 
eligible medical staff are also paid Clinical Excellence Awards in addition to their basic pay. 
This section of the workforce has a higher proportion of males.

Pay Gap Comparison – what do these results mean for the Trust? 

For the Trust there  

-  A higher ratio of female to male in the workforce. The ratio for the NHS is 78% to 22% 

- 

and for the Trust is 79.8% to 20.2% respectively.  
In the higher quartile of pay the ratio of female to male becomes 65% female to 35% 
male and females tend to be in the lower bands  

-  There is a predominantly male workforce in the higher banded Medical and Dental 

Professions where a bonus is applied (more details of the bonus follow this section).

The Clinical Excellence Awards (CEA)* is a bonus system which only applies to Medical 
consultants in recognition of outstanding achievements in high quality patient care. 
Consultants are a higher banded profession and only 81 staff are eligible for this bonus. 
Since Medical consultants are a predominantly male workforce only 21 of the 81 staff eligible 
are female. This has a high impact on the Gender Pay Gap results.

Additional Analysis  

By undertaking additional analysis the Trust can better understand and share where the 
gender pay gaps mainly occur, for instance not just by the pay quartiles but by band and by 
staff group.   

Staff groups  

Looking across the staff groups the largest gender pay gaps for women appear in 
Administrative and Clerical (26.14%) and Medical and Dental (12.34%) followed by Estates 
and Ancillary (6.55%) and Healthcare Scientists (7.69%).  

Conversely there are no male students and lower hourly rates for male are particularly seen 
for Allied Health Professionals, Additional professionals, and Nursing and Midwifery.

When staff in some of the higher quartile pay levels are excluded (Ad-hoc and Consultants) 
this has a significant impact on the mean and median Gender Pay Gap; the pay gap reduces 
from 29.08% to 12.53%. This is because there are proportionally fewer females in the higher 
paid bands. A similar impact can be observed if only the medical and dental grades are 
excluded from the data.

The measures we can consider for reducing the Gender Pay Gap  

The Trust will continue to review annually the gender split across all bands and staff groups 
including the Board and look to see if there are barriers to female career progression. We 
will also consider the following:    

  Review our leadership programmes and talent management initiatives to see if these 

are attractive to women and support them to progress.  
 

  Take account of gender in the providing of leadership opportunities e.g. NHS Insight 

Improvement Programme, Shadow Board Programme, coaching, mentoring or 
opportunity for secondments or to lead important projects.  
 

  Explore how we can attract more men into the profession at lower bands and within 

Nursing and Midwifery to get a better gender balance and equalities.

Appendix 1 

 

Gender Statistics in the NHS March 2018  

NHS workforce data shows: 

General Ratios  

 

that the ratio of women to men within the overall healthcare workforce is 78% to 22% 
respectively (in the Trust it is 80% to 20% 

 

  Even though the NHS is composed of 77% female staff, females make up: 

 

o  only 42% per cent of chief executives,  

o  32% of finance directors,  

o  24% of medical directors,  

o  68% of human resources directors  

 

However, they do make up 85 % of nursing directors. 

Doctors  

  47% of all doctors practising in the NHS are female  

  52% per cent of GPs are female.  

  There has been a 46% increase in the headcount of female GPs since 2004, while 

male headcount has decreased 4.7%  

  A striking 68% of GP registrars (those training to become GPs), are female. 

  49% of practising hospital / community doctors who qualified in the UK, are female,
