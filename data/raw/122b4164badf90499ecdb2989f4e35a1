We have over 400 staff in the group working across a range of services and pride ourselves on being an ethical and caring employer; ensuring staff are supported and rewarded appropriately. We have committed to the Oldham Fair Employment Charter and as a Community Interest Company we are able to reinvest some of the value we create in to the development of staff. In 2016 we are asking all staff to adopt a practice philosophy to underpin our high standards of care which focuses on the three H’s… Head – to work in a ‘whole’ person centred way when assessing people’s needs and aspirations, encouraging independence and delivering a better quality of life. Heart – to treat customers with compassion, dignity and to truly care in all that we do. Hands - to deliver care safely, from hands on tasks to keeping accurate records. We ask all of our staff to have this philosophy at the forefront of their mind when they are delivering services. We are always looking to recruit staff who have experience in delivering care or have the potential to be great at it. All that we ask is that people who work for us share our values. We advertise a wide range of roles so please get in touch if you are interested in working for us.
