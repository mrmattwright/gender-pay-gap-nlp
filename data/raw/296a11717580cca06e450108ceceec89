Being inclusive and having a diverse 
workforce is vital to our success. 
There is a wealth of research that 
shows diverse businesses perform 
better – through greater innovation, 
better decision making, and attracting 
and keeping great people – leading 
to better ﬁnancially performance, 
increased market share, and capturing 
new markets.

In an industry which has historically 
has low female representation, one of 
the key issues for us attracting diverse 
candidates to our business who have 
the required skills but may not have not 
have considered a career in a timber 
and builders merchant. Therefore, 
we are focusing on this area whilst 
ensuring we continue to offer great 
learning and development opportunities 
to all colleagues so they can maximise 
their potential. We will continue to 
annually publish our Gender Pay 
ﬁgures and report on our progress. 
Most importantly, we are actively 
encouraging our colleagues’ ideas and 
contributions on how we can foster 
diversity and inclusivity in every aspect 
of the business.

All UK organisations with over 250 
employees are now required to share 
details of their Gender Pay and Bonus 
Gaps, the percentage of men and 
women receiving a bonus, and the 
proportions of men and women in each 
pay quartile of our workforce. While 
it’s positive that our gender pay gap is 
lower than the UK average, the issues 
at play are complicated and we believe 
it’s more important to focus on taking 
meaningful action to drive equality 
and inclusivity rather than simply the 
numbers themselves.

RIDGEONS 2018 REPORT

What is Gender Pay Gap?

Gender Pay Gap shows the difference in the average hourly rate of pay between women and men 
in a company.  A gap may exist because different jobs pay different rates of pay and the number 
of women and men in those jobs varies.  A gender pay gap is not unlawful.

How is the 
Gender 
Pay Gap 
calculated?

Median (the middle) hourly pay gap
If we lined up all of our female colleagues from lowest  
to highest paid and did the same with our male colleagues, 
the median gender pay gap is the difference in hourly pay 
between the female and the male in the middle of their lines.

Mean (the average) hourly pay gap
If we add up all the hourly rates of pay for our female 
colleagues and divide that by the number of female 
colleagues we have in the company that gives us the 
average hourly rate of a for a female colleague. If we 
then do the same for our male colleagues, the difference 
between the female and the male average rate of pay is 
the mean gender pay gap.

RIDGEONS 2018 REPORT

We’re never 
complacent.

At 13.1% and 4.4% 
respectively, our mean  
and median Gender Pay  
Gaps are both lower than  
the whole economy and  
that for our sector.  

However, this favourable comparison 
does not mean we are complacent.   
We are fully committed to doing 
everything we can to reduce the gap, 
while recognising that our scope is 
limited in some areas – for example,  
we have no direct control over the 
subjects that individuals choose to study 
or the career choices that they make.

Our Mean (average)  
hourly pay gap is:

13.1%

Better than the sector Mean pay 
gap (18.9%) and whole economy 
Median pay gap (17.4%)*

Our Median (middle)  

pay gap is:

4.4%

Better than the sector Median  
pay gap (17.9%) and whole 
economy Median pay gap (18.4%)*

Our Gender Pay and Bonus Gap reports are based on a data snapshot at 5th April 2017 and are calculated using 
the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 
*Source: Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and earnings (ASHE) figures October 2017.

Pay Quartiles
The split of female 
and male colleagues 
in each quartile is 
calculated by lining up 
all our colleagues from 
the lowest paid to the 
highest paid then split 
into equal groups.
