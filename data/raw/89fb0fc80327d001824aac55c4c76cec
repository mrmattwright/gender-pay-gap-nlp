report 2017

“At AXA, we’re absolutely committed to 
becoming a truly inclusive place to work, 
where everyone can reach their true 
potential. We believe that not only is this 
the right thing to do, but it is vital for the 
success of our business.

While far from the full picture, gender 
pay gap reporting gives the impetus for 
businesses like AXA to take a cold, hard 
look at how well we’re doing in levelling 
the gender playing field.

Signing the Women in Finance Charter in 
2017 signalled our commitment and our 
employees can be assured that we will be 
restless in our pursuit of gender parity.”

“Our median pay 
gap is just below the 
national average2 of 
18.4% but that’s not 
good enough. We 
have a long way to go 
and are committed 
to understanding 
and proactively 
reducing that gap.”

driving our 
gender pay 
gap?

It’s not unequal pay that’s driving our gap 
because we regularly review all employees’ pay 
and our pay policies to ensure we offer equal 
pay for equal work, regardless of gender.

AXA’s gender pay gap is driven by there being a 
greater proportion of men than women in more 
senior positions and those that attract higher 
salaries. The pay quartile analysis (right) shows 
that there are more men (60%) than women 
(40%) in the highest paid group. At the same 
time, there are more women than men in roles 
attracting lower salaries with the lowest paid 
group having 65% women and 35% men. This 
combination is the leading cause of AXA UK’s 
gender pay gap.

Pay quartiles show the split of men and women 
in each quarter of our workforce when ordered 
by remuneration received. Each quartile 
contains 1,887 employees.

doing to reduce 
our gender 
pay gap?

We want to see gender equality 
across AXA UK ‒ as the lack 
of progression of women 
into senior roles is 
holding us back.

We’re acting to improve progression opportunities for women in our business, 
publicly committing to correcting gender imbalance at senior levels when we 
signed up to HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter in 2017.

The pledges we’ve made show how AXA is working to empower women and we 
encourage you to read more on axa.co.uk.

We’ve set a goal of 40%4 of senior management positions being held by women by
2020 and are changing to make this happen in a sustainable way, including:

1. Identifying and nurturing a pipeline of talented women,

2. Raising awareness of, and challenging, unconscious bias, and

3. Promoting the availability of flexible working options at all levels.

4 - Within a tolerance of 10% (i.e. 36% - 44% of senior managers)
