Why equal pay and the gender 
pay gap are not the same
A hypothetical Company X has  
50 employees (25 of each sex),  
5 grades and equal pay between  
men and women at each grade,  
but different numbers of men  
and women in each grade:
Level 1 

£60,000

GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

Introduction

This report contains BBC Worldwide’s statutory 
disclosure of the company’s gender pay gap using 
data from permanent and fixed-term staff based in 
the UK. It also contains additional voluntary findings 
of other pay gap and gender analysis, including data 
from an Equal Pay Audit, commissioned by BBC 
Worldwide and conducted by Evershed Sutherland 
(International) LLP (“Eversheds”). The headlines 
from this voluntary review are featured on page 02 
of this report and the full report can be found here.

  www.bbcworldwide.com/
about-us/who-we-are/

In addition, the calculations and results have been 
independently assured by Ernst & Young (EY), 
as set out on pages 05-07.
All companies with 250 or more UK employees  
are now required to publish their gender pay gap 
under new legislation that came into force in  

April 2017. Employers have to publish the gap in pay 
between men and women on both a median basis 
(pay per hour based on the person “in the middle” of 
the distribution of pay) and a mean basis (average 
hourly salary). 
As a commercial business we are required to report 
the data by 4 April 2018. We welcome and support 
gender pay gap reporting across the public and 
private sector. Along with our parent company – 
the BBC – we have a long standing commitment 
to ensuring we deliver equal opportunities for 
all. Nevertheless, we are not immune to broader 
societal issues affecting women in the workforce.
To accompany this report we are also publishing 
today a management response setting out the 
actions we will take to address the gender pay gap 
set out in this report.

Key Definitions

Methodology 
The methodology required to identify 
the pay gap between men and women 
includes both a median basis (pay per 
hour based on the person “in the middle” 
of the distribution of pay) and a mean 
basis (average hourly salary) for the 
snapshot date of 5 April 2017. In addition, 
employers are required to disclose the 
distribution of gender by pay quartile – 
in other words splitting the workforce 
into four groups based on their pay, 
and showing the proportion of men 
and women in each group. We are also 
required to disclose the percentages of 
staff receiving bonuses by gender and 
the gender bonus gap.

Gender pay gap: The gender pay gap  is the difference between the hourly rate of pay of male employees and female employees (as set out in the regulations), expressed as a percentage of the hourly pay rate of the male employees. The gender pay gap is reported on both a mean (average) and median (mid-point on a distribution) basis.  Equal pay: UK law has, since the 1970s, prohibited paying different amounts to men and women who are doing “like work”, “work of equal value” or “work rated as equivalent” unless there is a “genuine material factor” for the difference. Median vs. mean: The gender pay gap reporting regulations specifically require both the mean and median to be reported. These metrics are complementary, and illustrate different aspects of the distribution of pay across an organisation. The median is a statistic commonly used in analysing both internal pay tendency and external market norm, because it looks at the central tendency of the market or sample, showing the middle-most salary of a sample. Calculating the median involves taking all salaries in a sample, lining them up in order from lowest to highest, and picking the middle-most salary. The mean is the overall average of the whole sample and can thus be subject to the influences of any extremely high or low salaries at the top or bottom of the sample. In other words, the mean is much more subject to skewing by a small number of outliers.GENDER PAY GAP REPORTOUR PERFORMANCE 

The gender pay gap  
at BBC Worldwide

As of 5 April 2017, our overall gender pay 
gap was 16.9% on a median basis (18.9% 
using mean pay). These figures are 
comparable to the UK median of 18.1%. 
Our analysis also shows that 14.5% points 
of our mean gender pay gap of 18.9% 
is driven by the fact that we have more 
men in senior roles and conversely more 
women in junior roles. As an organisation 
we are not alone in identifying this issue 
– the UK Government and others have 
recognised that the structural pay gap is 
the single most significant factor in the 
overall pay gap. We are not complacent 
about this and we are working hard to 
improve this by increasing representation 
of women in senior roles.
This structural gap is further demonstrated 
in the charts to the right, which set out 
the gender profile by pay quartile. This 
confirms that we have more women 
in the lower quartile and more men in 
the upper quartile, highlighting that the 
primary driver of our gender pay gap is an 
imbalance in the representation of women 
and men in both junior and senior roles. 
After taking this structural issue into 
account, the mean gender pay gap would 
be 4.4%. This difference can arise from 
a number of factors including differing 
levels of skills and experience for people

doing otherwise similar jobs as well as 
the effect of market factors, which can 
affect pay. 
Alongside this report, we wanted to 
take the opportunity to conduct an 
Equal Pay Audit to analyse any causes 
of pay differences between employees 
graded 1-4, Senex and Senex1. We 
commissioned Eversheds to conduct 
this independent audit and the full report 
can be found at www.bbcworldwide.
com/EqualPayAudit. We are reassured 
that the conclusion of this audit confirms 
that Eversheds found no evidence 
from the pay data reviewed for grades 
1 to 4, Senex and Senex1 of systemic 
discrimination in BBC Worldwide pay 
systems.
All of this data provides a useful insight 
into where we need to focus our efforts in 
order to address the current imbalance. 
We have also analysed the gender pay 
gap by pay quartile as shown in the table 
below. This analysis shows that the 
gender pay gap is smaller within each 
quartile than the overall BBC Worldwide 
figure, which is consistent with the 
explanation given above that the main 
driver is the distribution of men and 
women across senior and junior roles 
within the organisation.

GENDER PAY GAP REPORTOUR PERFORMANCE 

The gender bonus gap  
at BBC Worldwide

The final data analysis required as part 
of the legislation is to provide details of 
bonus payments made in the financial 
year 2016/17 by gender. This data takes 
bonus payments made in July 2016 for 
the financial year 2015/16, as well as 
‘celebrating success’ vouchers paid 
throughout that year. 
BBC Worldwide’s annual bonus plan is a 
simple design calculated on our headline 
profit with no discretionary element. 
All profit targets are set by the BBC’s 
Remuneration Board. All BBC Worldwide 
employees were eligible to participate in 
the scheme, other than employees who 
have transferred in under the Transfer 
of Undertakings (TUPE), although 
this applies only to a small number 
of individuals. The bonus scheme is 
operated on a percentage salary basis 
within grades and therefore applies 
equally to all men and women across 
the business.

Bonus eligibility criteria

Our gender bonus gap is a median 
of 21.7% (with the mean at 33.9%), 
reflecting a higher percentage of men 
in more senior roles and therefore 
receiving both a higher bonus 
percentage and that percentage being 
applied to higher base pay figures. The 
higher percentage bonus for senior roles 
is in line with market practice and takes 
into account the fact there is a greater 
‘pay at risk’ element to bonuses for those 
in senior positions being paid out versus 
those in junior roles. 
The proportion of women who received 
a bonus and were still employed on 
5 April 2017 is 74.7%, with the proportion 
of men at 81.5%.

Of those employed at the 5 April 2017 reporting date almost a third were not eligible for a payment or only received a part year payment for the following reasons: •  Employees who received a bonus in July 2016 but were no longer employed by 5 April 2017 were excluded•  Employees who joined after 9 January 2016 were not eligible for a payment in July 2016•  Employees who joined part way through the 2015/16 financial year were only eligible for a pro-rata paymentGENDER PAY GAP REPORTDIVERSITY AT THE BBC WORLDWIDE 

Creating a  
diverse culture

Creating a diverse culture at BBC 
Worldwide is incredibly important to 
us and investing in and developing 
our people is one of the four strategic 
priorities of our business. It enables us 
to draw upon a wealth of experience, 
original and creative ways of delivering 
our strategy and it ensures our 
organisation is a more inclusive place  
to work. 
We already have a number of initiatives in 
place to ensure we deliver against these 
commitments. These include offering 
a full and varied training curriculum for 
all employees, leadership programmes 
to support employees to the next stage 
of their careers, and an employee 
engagement programme covering 
community relations, volunteering and 
sustainability. 

One way in which we seek feedback from 
our employees on how we are delivering 
against our inclusivity and inclusion 
targets is through our regular employee 
engagement survey. In 2017 we had an 
86.0% participation rate revealing an 
engagement score of 73.0%, versus  
the global market median of 58.0%. 
(IPSOS MORI). 
Within UK-based roles the data also 
highlights that overall we have a good 
gender balance with women comprising 
54.4% of our total population, and with 
51.0% of our middle manager roles 
and 36.0% of our senior manager level 
positions being held by women. In the 
year to which this report relates to at an 
Executive Committee level, we had four 
out of ten UK based positions held by 
women. Our only Executive Committee 
level position outside of the UK is also 
held by a woman, with our Americas 
President based in North America.

Pay gaps on other  
diversity measures
Alongside the data required for this 
report, we wanted to include additional 
voluntary analysis for diversity.
In 2017, the BBC UK-wide Diversity 
and Inclusion Census (based on staff 
self-reporting) confirmed that our 
performance is in line with or above 
BBC targets at 54.4% women; 20.3% 
BAME and 7.5% with a disability. 
While these figures are encouraging, 
we are committed to building on 
these to further increase diversity 
and representation throughout 
our organisation. We aim to tackle 
this through a number of initiatives 
including the recent introduction 
of a Diversity and Inclusion Council 
whose purpose is to drive change 
and deliver against our targets and 
on this commitment.
Based on the information available, 
the analysis concludes that our 
pay gaps in BAME and disability 
are smaller than those for gender. 
However, they reflect that the driving 
factor is the same, with a lower 
proportion of BAME or disabled 
employees currently in roles at senior 
levels across the organisation.

GENDER PAY GAP REPORTINDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
TO BBC WORLDWIDE’S MANAGEMENT 

EY statement 

The BBC requested that we perform an 
assurance engagement on selected 
performance data and related 
statements presented in the British 
Broadcasting Corporation’s (“the 
BBC”) 2017 gender pay gap statutory 
disclosures for BBC Worldwide (“the 
Report”). The engagement is designed 
to provide a limited level of assurance, in 
accordance with the ISAE3000 (Revised) 
standard1.
Respective responsibilities
The BBC’s management are responsible 
for the collection and presentation 
of the information within the Report. 
Management are also responsible 
for the design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal controls relevant 
to the preparation of the Report, so that 
it is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
Our responsibility, in accordance 
with management’s instructions, is to 
carry out a ‘limited level’ assurance 
engagement on selected data in the 
Report.
We do not accept or assume any 
responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person or organisation. Any 
reliance any such third party may place 
on the Report is entirely at its own risk.

What we did to form our 
conclusions
Our assurance engagement has been 
designed to provide a limited level of 
assurance in accordance with ISAE3000 
(Revised). The criteria we have used to 
evaluate the selected data (“the Criteria”) 
are described in the gender pay gap 
legislation2 and within the Report as 
footnotes.
The procedures we performed were 
based on our professional judgement 
and included the steps outlined below:
1.   Interviewed a selection of 

internal stakeholders from Senior 
Management, Legal, Compliance, 
Human Resources and Payroll to 
understand the current status of 
the gender pay gap within the BBC, 
the methodology, definition and 
approach used to calculate the 
gender pay gap, and structure of the 
data processes and current controls 
to support data quality.

 

2.   Carried out the following activities to 
review gender pay gap data samples 
and processes:
a.   Reviewed disaggregated gender 
pay gap data from BBC Worldwide 
to assess whether the data had 
been collected, consolidated and 
reported accurately.

 

 

b.   Reviewed and challenged 

supporting evidence provided.

c.   Tested whether gender pay 
gap data had been collected, 
consolidated and reported 
appropriately and accurately at the 
aggregate level.

3.   Challenged and reviewed disclosures 
in the Report relating to selected data 
to assess accuracy and balance, and 
consistency with observations made 
during work steps 1 and 2 as set out 
above.

Our review of the data processes 
was limited to the following statutory 
disclosures:
• 

the difference between the mean 
hourly rate of pay of male full-pay 
relevant employees and that of 
female full-pay relevant employees;
the difference between the median 
hourly rate of pay of male full-pay 
relevant employees and that of 
female full-pay relevant employees;
the difference between the mean 
bonus pay paid to male relevant 
employees and that paid to female 
relevant employees;
the difference between the median 
bonus pay paid to male relevant 
employees and that paid to female 
relevant employees;
the proportions of male and female 
relevant employees who were paid 
bonus pay; and
the proportions of male and female 
full-pay relevant employees in the 
lower, lower middle, upper middle and 
upper quartile pay bands.

Our assurance engagement did not 
include procedures over any additional 
disclosures or content within the Report.

GENDER PAY GAP REPORTThe limitations of our review
Our evidence gathering procedures 
were designed to obtain a “limited 
level” of assurance as set out in 
ISAE3000 (Revised) on which to base 
our conclusions. The extent of evidence 
gathering procedures performed is less 
than that of a ‘reasonable assurance’ 
engagement (such as an audit of 
financial statements) and therefore a 
lower level of assurance is provided.
Completion of our testing activities has 
involved placing reliance on the BBC’s 
controls for managing and reporting 
gender pay gap information, with the 
degree of reliance informed by the 
results of our review of the effectiveness 
of these controls. We have not sought 
to review systems and controls at the 
BBC beyond those used for gender pay 
gap data.
Our conclusions
Based on the scope of our review our 
conclusions are outlined below:
How complete and accurate is 
the gender pay gap information 
in the Report?
•  With the exception of the exclusions 
described in the Report (in particular 
on page 3), we are not aware of 
any material payroll accounts or 
employees that have been excluded 
from the gender pay gap statutory 
disclosures.

•  Nothing has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that the 
selected gender pay gap data has 
not been collated properly from BBC 
systems.

•  We are not aware of any errors that 
would materially affect the selected 
data as presented in the Report.

Our independence
With the exception of this work, we have 
provided no other assurance services 
relating to the BBC’s gender pay gap 
reporting.
We have implemented measures to 
ensure that we are in compliance with 
the applicable independence and 
professional competence rules as 
articulated by the IFAC Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants and ISQC1.
