 

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

 

 

1.  What is the gender pay gap report?  

 
Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees from April 2017 
to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male 
and female employees. There are two sets of regulations. The set of regulations that apply to 
Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (‘QVH’) are those determined for the public sector, 
where a snapshot of pay is taken with effect from 31 March 2017 and data presented in line with 6 
key indicators.   
 
Gender pay reporting presents data on the difference between men and women’s average pay 
within an organisation.  It is important to highlight the distinction between this and equal pay 
reporting, which is instead concerned with men and women earning equal pay for the same (or 
equivalent) work.  Across the country, average pay of women is lower than that of men and this 
tends to be because there are fewer women in senior high earning positions in organisations than 
men. Whilst a workforce may be predominantly female, if the most senior positions are taken up by 
men, the average pay of women in that organisation could well be lower. The Regulations have 
been brought in to highlight this imbalance, the aim being to enable employers to consider the 
reasons for any inequality within their organisation and to take steps to address it.1 
 

2.  The gender pay gap indicators  

 
An employer must publish six calculations showing their:  

  Average gender pay gap as a mean average  
  Average gender pay gap as a median average  
  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest to 

highest pay.  

  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average  
  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average  
  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a 

bonus payment  

 

3.  Methodology  

 
The statutory calculations have been undertaken using the national Electronic Staff Record (ESR) 
Business Intelligence standard report.  In line with NHS Employers guidance Clinical Excellence 
Awards and the approach taken to award them at QVH these have been categorised as bonuses.  
Pay includes: basic pay, full paid leave including annual, sick, maternity, paternity, adoption or 
parental leave, bonus pay, area and other allowances, shift premium pay, pay for piecework. 
 
Pay does not include: overtime pay, expenses (payments made to reimburse expenditure wholly 
and necessarily incurred in the course of employment, e.g. mileage for use of vehicle), 
remuneration in lieu of leave, the value of salary sacrifice schemes, benefits in kind (e.g. child care 
vouchers), redundancy pay and tax credits. 
 
Technical guidance on how these indicators are calculated can be found on the ACAS website.2

6.  Narrative  

a.  Mean vs. median averages  

 
QVH is broadly comparable to all other NHS Acute hospitals who have published their reports (see 
Appendix 1).  Both the mean and median hourly pay gap percentages for the sector are 
significantly affected by the presence of the Medical Consultant body due to both their high base 
wage and the Clinical Excellence Awards bonus scheme (that follows national guidelines).   
 
As the second smallest NHS Foundation Trust in England, we comparatively have a very small 
denominator of staff and the specialist nature of the work undertaken at QVH means the Medical 
Consultant body forms a much higher proportion of our overall workforce.  This means that the 
median pay gap percentages are much affected by this staff group.  Median calculations do not 
account for a concentration of high earners in such a small hospital given.  The difference between 
the number of male Consultants (n = 50) compared to female Consultants (n = 24) is considerable. 
The mean can therefore be seen as more accurately reflecting the gender pay gap due to the 
higher proportion of men in these highest paid senior positions, as demonstrated in the quartile-
based data in Section 5b.3     
 

b.  Band / grade related average gender pay gaps 

 
Taking the mean average as the more representative of scores, two potential outliers are 
highlighted when looking at bands/grades (Section 5a, Tables 3): the Medical Consultants group 
and the Agenda for Change [AFC] Band 8+ group 
 
When comparing the gender pay gap as a mean average solely within the Medical Consultant 
body (Section 5a, Table 3) there is still an undesirable gap of 11.9%.  Historically across the NHS 
the medical profession has been predominantly male and only in recent years have equal numbers 
of females been entering the profession as junior doctors.  Across all staff groups, deeper analysis 
highlights a very strong correlation between longer length of service and higher pay-rates, which is 
determined by national pay-scales.  However this is most pronounced within this Medical 
Consultant staff group where the 2003 Consultant Contract pay-scales stretch the highest pay-
award to 19+ years of service as a Consultant.  Only 6 female Consultants have 9+ years’ service 
and earn the sixth payment threshold of £92,078 (or more) compared to 24 male Consultants.  
Preliminary discussions around both revised national Consultant Contract and AFC terms and 
conditions suggest that a reduction in the number of points available on tenure-linked pay scales is 
likely which will be the systematic way of equalising this area.  
 
When examining the AFC Band 8+ group differences, the relatively small number of individuals (n 
= 45) means that the variation across Bands 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d and 9 has a big effect.  11 of the 15 
males in this group are Bands 8b and above (73%) which compares to 15 of 30 females (50%) 
resulting in the pay gap.

c.  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average  

 
The average bonus gender pay gap is caused by the same ‘long years of service’ phenomenon 
outlined above, as the higher bonuses are earnt through cumulative awards based on longer years 
of service.   
 
Although the crude statutory reporting figure of ‘who received bonus pay’ [Section 4c] shows 2% of 
males compared to 1% of females receiving a bonus, the only staff eligible for a bonus at QVH are 
Medical Consultants earning Clinical Excellence Awards.  When looking at the comparative data 
specifically for this eligible staff group it is reassuring to see that QVH goes against the national 
trend with more females being awarded bonuses (66.67%) compared to the male comparator 
group (48%).   
 
With a higher proportion of female Consultants applying for QVH roles and being appointed in 
more recent years, the proportion of those eligible for bonuses will continue to increase.
