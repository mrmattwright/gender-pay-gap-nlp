Engagement  Guiding principle   We want employees to be proud to work for us. We want them to understand our vision and goals, and to commit to EMCOR UK’s larger objectives so they feel motivated to produce high-quality work aligned to our strategy for the best possible result for our customers.  Initiatives   EMCOR UK’s differentiation strategy is based upon putting employees and customers at the heart of our business to make our customers’ lives easier. Through customer and employee surveys, we have established a clear link between employee engagement and customer satisfaction.  To increase the level of engagement, we have developed and reviewed our major people processes including: recruitment and induction; training; reward and recognition; appraisals; and employee communications.  Directors and senior managers have conducted leadership visits at our employees’ workplaces. This has been well received by our employees, and has laid the foundation for improving employee engagement at every level within the organisation.  Goals    Identify, consolidate, integrate, and embed new people processes.  Continue employee engagement surveys.  Continue year on year improvement of employee satisfaction through the employee engagement survey.   2. Living the values  Guiding principle   It’s not just what we do that matters; it’s how we do it. Our values must always translate into behaviours that deliver superior customer service and differentiate us from the competition.  Initiatives   The annual appraisal process (Personal Performance Planning, or “PPP”) has been redesigned to include an assessment of every employee’s approach and competence to behave in accordance with our values. The EMCOR UK Competency Framework defines our expectations and includes a list of positive and negative indicators, so all employees and managers are working toward common and consistent standards.  Demonstrated adherence to our values is the basis for a new employee reward and recognition scheme. The scheme, called GEMS, was launched in 2014, and gives employees the opportunity to nominate their colleagues for an award.  Goals    Line managers continue to issue the competency framework, appropriate for their team member’s roles, as part of PPPs.  Fully implement and embed the GEMS scheme across the whole business.   3. Diversity  Guiding principle   Across the UK, we operate within diverse communities. We want our workforce to recognise and reflect this diversity because it brings insights and behaviours that enable us to better relate to our customers and by doing so we can continually improve our performance.  Initiatives   EMCOR UK recognises that tackling big issues like diversity needs to be driven from the top. An executive board member is responsible for identifying mega trends, including diversity, in the UK. Through this integrated approach, we identify diversity risks and opportunities for our business and use our findings in the formulation of our business strategies.  Our management teams also participate in diversity training through our recruitment skills training course, which includes a section on unconscious bias.  Goals    Complete rollout of the new recruitment skills training course for all hiring managers, including senior and executive directors.  Implement and rollout a senior manager’s diversity awareness and training programme for directors, executives, and senior managers.  Recruit, develop, promote, and retain outstanding people who reflect the diversity of our customers and the communities in which we work.   4. Skills and development  Guiding principle   We will increase opportunities for our people to develop their work skills and personal competency, generating more career progression within the company, whilst simultaneously harnessing and deploying the extensive talent within our business.  Initiatives   Many of our employees receive an annual performance and development review from their supervising manager, which is recorded using our online PPP system. We have also developed an on line training tool which is aimed at improving the accessibility of essential training for all employees. As an enhancement, we developed a series of compliance, technical, and health and safety modules, and much of our workforce regularly attends classroom soft skills and personal development training. We offer over 500 courses annually.  Goals    Annual performance and development reviews are given and recorded using the online PPP system. This review includes discussions on job skills, competency framework, career development, and how employees can progress within the company.  Continue conducting bi-annual management capability reviews and succession plans across the business.  Continue expanding the range of soft and non-technical job-specific skills training courses available to employees.  Continue determining new skills profiles for our standard job roles, including the identification of courses that need to be completed.  Continue requiring employees to demonstrate understanding of skill sets and career-enhancement avenues.   5. Employee management  Guiding principle   We are committed to establishing a working environment free from bullying, harassment, and victimisation. This work environment promotes high levels of care and fairness for everyone. We do this so that all our employees know that their needs are taken into consideration when business decisions are made.  Initiatives   Senior managers and directors complete our code of conduct and business ethics training. Also, line managers and supervisors complete a course on communicating across a diverse workforce, as well as a training module focused on workplace harassment issues.  Goals    Explore the development of an information and consultation forum.  Develop a leadership programme for senior managers that raises awareness, knowledge, and skills in the areas of best practice and contemporary leadership skills.  Complete the leadership programme for experienced managers, with a target goal of 100% of delegates being awarded a level five qualification from the Institute of Leadership and Management.  Update the front line management development programme to improve the alignment of the course content to the requirements of the level three certificate from the Institute of Leadership and Development.  Continue the “Managing Employees the EMCOR Way” training course.  Review online training records for the diversity, harassment, and bullying at work programmes.
