This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/natural-england-gender-pay-gap-report-2017/natural-england-gender-pay-gap-report-2017        Background  Earlier this year, the government introduced world-leading legislation that made it statutory for organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on their gender pay gap. Government departments are covered by the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which came into force on 31 March 2017. These regulations underpin the public sector equality duty and require organisations to publish their gender pay gap data by 30 March 2018 (and then annually), including:   mean and median gender pay gaps  the mean and median gender bonus gaps  the proportion of men and women who received bonuses  the proportions of male and female employees in each pay quartile   The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with. Individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are.  The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.  Natural England supports the fair treatment and reward of all staff irrespective of gender. The Defra group equality, diversity and inclusion ( EDI ) strategy 2017 to 2020 sets out:   our ambition to be a top performing organisation with a diverse range of talent  our commitment to creating a culture where everyone can bring their whole self to work and their uniqueness is truly valued   This report fulfils Natural England’s reporting requirements, analyses the figures in more detail and sets out what we are doing to close the gender pay gap in the organisation.  Context  Natural England uses a staff framework ranging from Support Adviser to Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), this follows a similar structure to Civil Service grading as follows:     Natural England staff framework  Civil Service grade equivalent      Support Adviser  Administrative Officer    Adviser  Executive Officer    Lead Adviser, Specialist, Group Coordinator  Higher Executive Officer    Senior Adviser, Senior Specialist, Team Leader  Senior Executive Officer    Principal Adviser, Principal Specialist, Manager  Grade 7 / Grade 6    Director  SCS Pay Band 1    Chief Officer  SCS Pay Band 2    Chief Executive Officer  SCS Pay Band 3     Levels of role vary according to the level of responsibility that people have.  Each role level has a pay group and each pay group has a set pay range with specific pay points:   minimum - the recruitment threshold or starting salary  midpoint - between the pay group minimum and the target rate  target rate - the rate of pay for someone who, over a period of time, is demonstrating all the required capabilities for their role, ways of working and contribution expected of them at this level of the organisation  higher performance ceiling - the maximum rate of pay   People are expected to move through the pay range for their pay group. The longer the period of time that someone has been in a pay group the more we would expect them to earn irrespective of their gender.  Natural England currently employs apprentices, and we have differentiated the pay of those in year 1 of their contract and those in year 2.  This is because first-year apprentices were paid in line with government guidelines at the time before a rule change in the following year, which Natural England has also applied.  To present combined gender pay figures for the 2 sets of apprentices would suggest a significant gender pay gap when there isn’t one. Showing these two groups separately demonstrates the actual real position.     Grade (increasing seniority)  Number of men (% of workforce)  Number of women (% of workforce)  % female    Apprentice (year 1)  1 (0%)  4 (0.2%)  80%    Apprentice (after year 1)  3 (0.1%)  2 (0.1%)  40%    AO  132 (6.1%)  148 (6.8%)  54%    EO  160 (7.4%)  253 (11.6%)  61%    HEO  344 (15.8%)  458 (21.1%)  57%    SEO  233 (10.7%)  252 (11.6%)  52%    G7  97 (4.5%)  62 (2.9%)  39%    SCS 1  7 (0.3%)  5 (0.2%)  42%    SCS 2  4 (0.2%)  0 (0%)  0%    SCS 3  1 (0%)  0 (0%)  0%    Board Members  8 (0.4%)  2 (0.1%)  20%     55% of Natural England’s workforce are women.  29% of Natural England’s Senior Leadership Team and Directors (SCS equivalent) are women  Gender pay gap     Mean gender pay gap  Median gender pay gap      10.9%  13.2%     The gender pay gap figures are based on hourly pay rates.  Bonus pay gap     Mean gender bonus gap  Median gender bonus gap      20%  0%     Natural England’s performance awards were paid as a set value depending on the performance rating awarded under guidelines set out in the Natural England performance management system, irrespective of grade or gender.  Bonuses were pro-rated for people who work part-time.  Proportion of men and women receiving a bonus     Men  Women      87%  89%     Pay by quartile     Hourly pay quartile  Women  Men      Lower quartile  56%  44%    Lower middle quartile  66%  34%    Upper middle quartile  58%  42%    Upper quartile  39%  61%     The lower quartile of people comprises 56% females and the upper quartile comprises 39%.  As 55% of Natural England’s people are women, this illustrates that the pay gap is largely as a result of a higher concentration of women in more junior roles and fewer females in more senior roles.  This is particularly demonstrated by:   Principal Specialist/ Principal Adviser/ Manager - 61% male, 39% female  Chief Officer - 100% male, 0% female  Board Member - 80% male, 20% female   The CEO (SCS 1 equivalent) and Board Members group both show widened gender pay gap by virtue that the CEO and Chair are male.  Working to reduce the gender pay gap  Natural England is committed to improving its gender pay gap and delivering a number of initiatives through its EDI strategy to support women in the workplace.  There is active support for women returning to work following maternity or adoption leave.  We offer shared parental leave, job share, part-time opportunities and flexible working.  We equally offer these opportunities to men to enable all employees to fulfil their caring responsibilities irrespective of gender.  Natural England intends to have all its people managers undertake training to help support the process of performance ratings, which are made mid-year and at year end and ensure that there is no unconscious bias when determining ratings.  These ratings are subject to monitoring on a number of characteristics, including gender.  We help women to progress their careers through schemes such as:   Positive Action Pathway - a talent programme for under-represented groups  Crossing Thresholds - a year-long career development programme for Women in the Civil Service, recently opened up to Non-Departmental Public Bodies  Natural England Future Leadership Scheme   We provide a range of employee led networks supported and championed by Natural England’s senior leadership and EDI teams.  Natural England’s gender champion aims to help women reach their full potential by providing advice and support, contributing to policy development and establishing good practices.  We monitor pay to identify any pay differences and take targeted action, where appropriate and where budget constraints allow.  We have improved the recruitment process through anonymised application processes, ensuring that all interviewers have undergone unconscious bias training and using diverse interview panels for selection. Recruitment data is monitored through the attraction, recruitment and selection process to identify areas for further improvement in recruiting a diverse workforce.
