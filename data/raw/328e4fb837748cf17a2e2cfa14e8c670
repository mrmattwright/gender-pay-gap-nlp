GENDER PAY GAP 
REPORT 2017

“

Diversity is a business imperative. It fosters better decision making, enriches our talent pool and drives 
innovation. A cornerstone of our diversity agenda is gender equality.

This report shows that Strutt & Parker had both a gender pay gap and a bonus pay gap 
on 5 April 2017. Strutt & Parker is now part of the Real Estate arm of BNP Paribas UK.
It is clear that there is work to be done to address this gap, and that it will take a 
collective and sustained effort from everyone to do so.
We take this issue very seriously and we are committed to making sure that we become 
more diverse, at every level of our business. We believe the future success of our business 
depends on it.

Understanding the gender pay gap

IS THE GENDER PAY GAP THE SAME 
AS EQUAL PAY?
No. They are two separate matters, as explained 
below.

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP? 
The gender pay gap concerns the hourly pay 
of all men who work in a company compared 
to the hourly pay of all women who work in the 
same company. It does not account for different 
types of jobs or levels of seniority.

WHAT IS EQUAL PAY?
Equal pay is when a man and a woman are paid 
the same for doing the same or similar work. 
We take our moral and legal responsibilities 
on equal pay seriously, and conduct reviews 
regularly to ensure salary and bonus decisions 
are fair and gender neutral.

•  There are two main reasons for the gender pay gap both  
  across the Real Estate industry and at BNP Paribas: 

37%

45%

•  There are more men than women in senior positions. 

•  The higher salaries that senior roles attract, relative to  
  other positions, significantly increases the average male  
  pay both in the market and at BNP Paribas Real Estate.

 

 
 

GENDER BONUS GAP

Overall, we have significantly higher mean and median bonus 
gaps than hourly pay gaps. This is because:

• 

 Bonus amounts tend to increase with seniority and we 
currently have more men than women in senior roles.

•  We have more men than women in surveying roles,    
  which typically attract larger bonus opportunities.

• 

  More of our part-time employees are women. The calculation 
for the bonus gap does not account for bonuses being 
pro-rated for part-time employees.

POPULATION BY QUARTILE 
Pay quartiles are calculated by ranking the hourly pay of all staff, 
then splitting the range into four equal quartiles and calculating 
the proportion of men and woman in each quartile. The higher 
proportion of men in the upper quartiles reflects the fact that 
there are more men than women in senior positions, and client 
development roles, which attract higher rates of pay.

Advocating for gender equality and addressing the gender pay gap is a responsibility that we 
take very seriously. Only by being open and transparent about the challenges that we face can 
true change come. This report represents the Real Estate arm of BNP Paribas UK and I’m pleased 
to have this opportunity to share some of the initiatives that we have already put into place to 
close the gap, as well as our future plans.
