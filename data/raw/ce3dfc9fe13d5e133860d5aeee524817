Recent Gender Pay Gap Analysis in the U.K.  The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men and women, and is always expressed as a percentage of male earnings. These U.K.-required reporting statistics are not the same as equal pay, which deals with pay discrimination and the differences in pay when members of the opposite sex are paid differently but yet they carry out the same work, similar work or work of equal value. A pay gap is not necessarily evidence of pay discrimination in the workplace; a pay gap can exist for a variety of legitimate non-discriminatory reasons. This is the case at VMware.    Our disclosure for The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 in the UK reveals an issue which is common across the technology industry: There are simply not enough women in senior technology roles.
