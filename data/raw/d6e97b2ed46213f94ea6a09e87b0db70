As well as publication on this website it has also been made available to all Council employees and workers.  It is also included in the Government Gender Pay Gap website with the reports of other public and private sector employers.  Promoting equality  The Council is committed to promoting equality in all of its activities including the provision of its services and employment of its staff.  The Council’s Equality Strategy is available on the website and sets out how it engages with the equality principle.  The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 came into force on 31 March 2017.  The Regulations require public authorities with 250 or more employees to publish specific information about differences in pay between male and female employees and workers based on the pay period in which 31 March 2017 falls.  The information which is closely defined to allow comparison with other public authorities and with other organisations has to be published by no later than 30 March 2018.  Preston City Council Gender Pay Gap Statistics  The information for Preston City Council is shown below:      Female  Male  Difference      Number of staff  421  419     Mean hourly rate  11.8557  12.2524  3.24%    Median hourly rate  10.3349  10.3349  0.00%    % age - Lower Quartile  54.69%  45.31%     % age - Lower Middle Quartile  45.08%  54.92%     % age - Upper Middle Quartile  52.64%  47.36%     % age - Upper Quartile  48.06%  51.94%      Comments  There is a small percentage gender pay gap on the mean hourly rate but a zero gender pay gap on the median hourly rate.  The Council already subscribes to many of the actions listed in the recommendations made by the Government Equalities Office and Chartered Institute of Personnel Development . These include policies aimed at:   Ensuring recruitment processes are free from gender bias  Providing opportunities for flexible working wherever possible  Ensuring best use of parental leave and encouraging returners  Fair pay structures through job evaluation and fair distribution of development opportunities   There are some limitations to the impact of the above policies. For example, there are concentrations of male employees in occupations within waste collection, parks and street scene which are mostly in the lower middle quartile pay band.  It is more difficult in these work areas to provide the kind of flexible working which is available in office-based environments.  The Council will however look in more detail at specific areas where there is an apparent gender disparity to see whether there is scope for improvement.
