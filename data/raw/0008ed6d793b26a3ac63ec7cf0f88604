Further Information & FSCS       Anti-Slavery Statement Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2018 This Statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”) and sets out the steps that Arbuthnot Latham & Co., Limited has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chains or any part of its business or that of its subsidiaries (“AL Group”). Introduction Arbuthnot Latham does not tolerate modern slavery or human trafficking within the AL Group’s business operations and is committed to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking. This Statement sets out the actions that Arbuthnot Latham has taken and will continue to take, to understand and combat slavery and human trafficking risks within the businesses of the AL Group. Our business Arbuthnot Latham is a private limited company registered in England and Wales and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Arbuthnot Banking Group PLC (ABG). Arbuthnot Latham provides private banking and commercial banking services, with offices in London, Manchester, Exeter, Bristol and Dubai. Renaissance Asset Finance specialises in asset-backed lending to both private and commercial customers. The AL Group prides itself on quality of service and reputation built on understanding client needs. Our policy on slavery and human trafficking We operate a Modern Slavery Act Policy which reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our business or supply chains. We also operate a Whistleblowing Policy, which encourages our employees to report any concerns or wrongdoing. Supply chain risk We operate within a professional and regulated environment and do not have complex supply chains or obtain material services from suppliers with a high risk of slavery or human trafficking. We have adopted a risk-based approach to review existing suppliers and will adopt it for any new supplier that we contract with.  We provide all suppliers rated as high risk with a copy of the Arbuthnot Latham Modern Slavery Act Policy and require them to adhere to it. Where applicable, contractual provisions will be included in agreements or terms of business with suppliers, which is reviewed at least on an annual basis. Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking, we carry out appropriate due diligence when engaging and working with suppliers, whilst also ensuring that the diligence undertaken is proportionate to the services provided. In order to fulfil our obligations under the Act, Arbuthnot Latham will:  Request information regarding the supplier’s working practices and require the relevant supplier to confirm that it is aware of, and adheres with, its requirements and obligations under the Act.  Make all existing and potential new suppliers aware that we have a zero tolerance approach with regards to slavery.  Provide training to relevant stakeholders and parties on slavery and our obligations under the Act.  Include reference to, and compliance with, the Act prior to enter into a contract or terms of business or any other contractual agreements with all third party suppliers.  Training and policies Training is fundamental to raising awareness and educating all Group staff members on the issues highlighted in the Act. We therefore provide relevant training and development for all staff members. This is to ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and business and our obligations of the Act. Furthermore, as part of our commitments under the Act, we have developed an internal policy which is available to all our employees which provides further guidance on how to identify, manage and report such risks. All directors have been briefed on the subject. Approval procedure This Statement has been reviewed by key stakeholders, senior management and has been approved by the Board of Directors of Arbuthnot Latham for the financial year ending 2017. This Statement will be reviewed annually and updated as required. Conclusion We reiterate our ongoing commitment to the Act and its underlying principles.

Important information about compensation arrangements We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”). The FSCS can pay compensation to depositors if a bank is unable to meet its financial obligations. Most depositors – including most individuals and small businesses – are covered by the scheme. From 1st January 2016 all eligible depositors are entitled to claim up to £85,000. For joint Accounts each Account holder is treated as having a claim in respect of their share so, for a joint Account held by two eligible depositors, the maximum amount that could be claimed would be £85,000 each (making a total of £170,000). The £85,000 limit relates to the combined amount in all the eligible depositor’s Accounts with the bank including their share of any joint Account, and not to each separate Account. For further information about the compensation provided by the FSCS (including the amounts covered and eligibility to claim) please speak to your Private Banker, refer to the FSCS website www.FSCS.org.uk or call the FSCS on +44 (0)20 7741 4100 or +44 (0)800 678 1100.
