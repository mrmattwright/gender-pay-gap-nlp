Forticrete are pleased to comply with these new regulations and believe firmly in providing equal opportunities regardless of gender or ethnicity.  As a building products manufacturer, Forticrete has traditionally attracted a very high proportion of male employees, especially within factory based production roles.  Office based support roles have a more even split of male and female employees, including high representation of women in customer support roles.  We are working hard to encourage more females into the business. Our current employee population reflects the traditional nature of the industry, with around 85% of roles being occupied by men, including a high percentage males employed in factory based production roles.  Our employee population is therefore reflective of the manufacturing sector as a whole, and especially within building products manufacturing where men have traditionally performed factory based production roles.  We are proud of the steps we have already taken, and continue to take, to encourage more females into the business.  However we clearly believe further continued action needs to be taken to increase the representation of women within our production facilities, which offer diverse roles suitable for all.  This gender pay gap data is a valuable tool to help understand why our own business and our industry are missing out on female talent.  We see gender pay gap reporting as a critical step in our drive to attract, retain and develop a diverse workforce at Forticrete.  What impacts the pay and bonus gap at Forticrete?  Manufacturing and the Building Materials industries face a challenge to attract more women into the sector.  Forticrete is no different in this regard.  Due to the demographics of our workforce, there is an under-representation of women holding managerial and senior roles in production and in central functions which is the main factor causing our mean and median pay gaps in favour of men.  Bonus pay gaps are impacted by our demographic make-up, also whereby:   The vast majority of our people are employed in production with the roles filled predominantly by men.  At Forticrete, the pay structure for our weekly paid production employees includes an element of weekly variable pay which is linked to the delivery of production targets.  This is captured in bonus pay.  As a result, a higher proportion of male employees receive bonus compared to females (who on the whole are in salaried roles that have less variable pay elements).  More men hold senior management roles that participate in our management bonus schemes, which are paid with respect to company and personal performance, and these can provide a significant proportion of overall pay.  With more men in the roles that are eligible for these schemes, this results in a bonus gap in favour of men.     Forticrete Limited’s gender pay gap 2017     Taking action  Our results show we have more work to do. Our mean gender pay gap of 21% is slightly higher than the national average of 17.4%.  However we are taking action to close the gap and we are committed to regular analysis, monitoring and continuing work to remedy the gap that we have.  At Forticrete we are committed to providing equal opportunities and increasing the diversity of our workforce. We are already undertaking several initiatives to increase diversity across our business:   Recruitment: We are taking a number of steps aimed at encouraging a diverse and wide range of candidates internally and externally for all roles within the company, including our production areas where there is a significant under representation of women for instance.  We are working with our recruitment partners to ensure that we are attracting high quality candidates from a wide range of cultural backgrounds regardless of gender or ethnicity. We have recently seen a small increase in the number of females joining us in production roles in our main Leighton Buzzard site which is encouraging.  We are reviewing our websites and advertising material to ensure we are showing a true reflection of a company which genuinely encourages and celebrates diversity within our businesses.  This will include showcasing the success we have already enjoyed where we have a number of women in roles which traditionally may have only attracted male candidates.  We are carrying out refresher diversity training and highlighting areas such as unconscious bias, so we change mind-sets and put at the forefront of our managers and employees minds the importance of diversity and the benefits of having a culturally diverse workforce.    Flexible working: We have always offered a number of flexible working arrangements including part time working and job sharing. These arrangements are open for all employees and decided on a case by case basis in line with our operational requirements.  Mentoring: We are working with our sister company Ibstock Brick Limited and have established an internal networking and mentoring scheme to provide more female role models and to support and encourage our female employees to develop and grow their careers with us. We have also formed a link with Aspire, an internationally recognised leadership, management and communication skills organisation. Aspire are currently leading a “MAD” (Making A Difference) movement focused on coaching and development for women in business.     We know it will take a long-term commitment to significantly change the make-up of our workforce – and of the manufacturing sector. We will continue to drive these efforts to make Forticrete a diverse employer of choice.
