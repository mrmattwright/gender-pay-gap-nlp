In Cleethorpes (well someone has to be!) I started my catering career on Grimsby docks filleting fish, and look where that’s got me.    After studying business and catering management in both Grimsby and later Norwich where I met Tracy my long-suffering wife, I worked as a chef, hotel manager and finally moved into contract catering. In this arena I worked in operations and sales, where after too many years to mention I met Tim and started T(n)S Catering in June 2003.    I have been married to Tracy for over 26 years and have two fantastic daughters, Caty and Megan. As well as my family my other passions in life are holidays, country sports and my Harley Davidson Motorcycle.    My favourite restaurant is Ernie Beckett Fish and Chips, Cleethorpes Market Place.         Natasha    My working life started as a telephone operator at BT, but soon realised that working in finance would be my vocation in life.  I have worked in an accounts environment since 1993 and still love the work I do.    I met my husband, Dave, over twenty years ago during a Banger racing meeting at Wimbledon.  (No I didn’t drive in any races!)  We have two wonderful daughters, Emily & Hannah and a mad cocker spaniel called Max.    When I am not busy at work, my family is the centre of my life.  We spend our time walking the dog, riding our bikes, trips to the cinema and gardening.    I love listening to music and my favourite artist is Jamie Cullum who I have seen in concert quite a few times (and have been lucky enough to meet!).    My claim to fame was dancing with Bananarama on Saturday Superstore back in the 80’s!       Rocky    Started my catering career in East Sussex, making sandwiches and salads and loads of washing up, a good place to start!    Moved to work in London; loved it and decided to go to Catering College in Eastbourne for 2 years.    Various positions in the East for independent Restaurants & Hotels then into contract catering for Gardner Merchant (now Sodexo), finally ending up as Head Chef at Ashdown Park where I met my wife Josephine, my boss at the time…!    Moved to Cambridgeshire with Jo and our two sons Elliott & Jacques at Nelson Hind’s first venture into Private Schools, then onto Ops Manager and finally Ops Director, until settling with T(n)S from the very beginning in 2003 as Ops Director.    23 Years of marriage, 2 intelligent sons (take after their mother), 1 Cocker Spaniel – Remy, a free tasty lunch every day, 11 years of T(n)S & working with a great team on the exciting Roller Coaster ride that is T(n)S…..         Tim    I was born in Manchester but raised in Chester with my younger brother, Nick, who also owns his own company called Alpkit . Never thought I’d move from Chester as it’s such a beautiful city and my youngest two boys Ben and James were born there. I got my first Job in Catering at a local fast food Restaurant called Tony’s – washing dishes and flipping burgers! I ended up working in The Chester Grosvenor with 1 Michelin star.    I then moved to Norwich with Sandra, my wife where our two younger boys, Matt and Wibby (long story) he’s called William, were born. I was running the Norwich Union contract for Nelson Hind which fed some 7000 people a day. When Nelson Hind sold I became a Board Director at Avenance and moved to a village called Brixworth in Northamptonshire.    Then in 2003, I started the greatest Adventure of my life when I started T(n)S with Phil, soon joined by Rocky and Natasha who all worked at Nelson Hind and Avenance with me. When I’m not working I love gardening, cycling, running, movies, eating and cooking great food! and walking our Rhodesian Ridgeback, Tia. Needless to say the last 10 years have been a roller coaster of delights and some heartache but I wouldn’t change a thing. I consider myself extremely lucky to have met such a talented and warm group of people to work with.    They’re not just my colleagues but also my friends.         Steve    My catering career started when I was 15 when I decided to drop Physics at school to work every Tuesday afternoon at The Little Chef in Tewkesbury to gain work experience. After a 2 year catering course in Cheltenham I worked in various hotels and restaurants in Gloucestershire, Runcorn, Essex and Sussex before moving back to Gloucester and getting married to Karen in 1996.    On our wedding anniversary each year we have dinner at the fantastic Champignon Sauvage in Cheltenham but my sons Jack and Harry prefer the BBQ ribs at the Beefeater!    Apart from spending time with my family, I am a passionate Aston Villa fan and have followed them home and abroad over the years. You can also find me on the golf course from time to time playing golf wearing a big Sombrero…          Previous  Next        Case Study: Business and Industry    Financial Sector B&I Contract  Fact Box  2800 people on site  Multi tenanted and multi cultural site with a wide demographic  Services include Cafe, Restaurant, Hospitality and Vending    Achievements:   Reduction in Subsidy 33%  Increase in sales 7.5% year on year  Redesign of cafe area and introduction of a self service concept coffee bar and soup station at lunch saw a labour saving of 30K and increased sales of £10.5K per annum.

National Caterer puts Heart and Sole into Fish Sustainability    from L to R: Steve Hughes and Caroline Scott of T(n)S Catering   National Caterer puts Heart and Sole into Fish Sustainability[1]  Thousands of workers, school children and patients will be offered ‘alternative’ sustainable fish species, as T(n)S Catering sign the Sustainable Fish Cities pledge. The pledge means that diners will be offered only fish from more plentiful populations, caught using lower-impact methods, as rated by the Marine Conservation Society[2]. These include dab, coley whiting, sardine, pouting and hake landed in Plymouth; species rarely seen on menus in the UK, even though they are frequently caught by local boats and populations considered to be in good shape.  Ruth Westcott, Co-ordinator of Sustainable Fish Cities, said: “This is a fantastic commitment and will affect the fish served in millions of meals every year. Particularly impressive is the range of species that T(n)S serve. Serving unusual, sustainably-caught species supports the whole local catch and will inspire and educate our consumers about the many delicious species caught in the UK. Well done to T(n)S catering, I hope their commitment will inspire other caterers and restaurants to follow suit.”  T(n)S Catering serves approximately 13,325 meals per day across the UK, and the pledge will help support the growing number of towns and cities that are working towards becoming Sustainable Fish Cities, by gathering pledges from local schools, care homes, higher education sites, workplaces and restaurants.  Caroline Scott, Operations Manager from T(n)S Catering said: We are delighted to have signed the Sustainable Fish Cities pledge – we have a responsibility to serve food which will ensure our customers and the environment are healthy for many generations to come, and we hope we can send a signal to the rest of the fish industry that all fish served in the UK should be sustainably sourced. T(n)S Catering already have strong commitments to sourcing locally-grown and produced food, including meat, fruit & vegetables, dairy products and locally baked bread. We feel by committing to this pledge that we are supporting the local fishing community in the south west.”  Notes [1] The Sustainable Fish Cities Pledge commits fish-serving businesses to serve only fish which can be demonstrated as sustainable, according to the following principles: –  Avoid the worst: Remove those rated as ‘fish to avoid’ by the Marine Conservation Society –  Promote the best: Serve sustainably managed fish – MSC/ASC certified, organic, BAP 3* rated or GlobalGap certified, and those rated as ‘fish to eat’ by the Marine Conservation Society – Improve the rest: Influence wider progress by supporting fishery improvement, telling supplier(s) that they only want to serve sustainable fish, and take time-bound action on any species considered ‘fish to eat occasionally’.  The campaign is organised by an alliance of not-for-profit organisations, sustainable catering advisors and marine conservation specialists. Members of the Sustainable Fish City working group include Marine Conservation Society (MCS), the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and Pisces Responsible Fish Restaurants. Sustainable Fish City is coordinated by Sustain: The alliance for better food and farming, see: www.sustainweb.org/sustainablefishcity/  [2] The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is the UK’s leading charity for the protection of our seas, shores and wildlife. The voice for our seas for almost 30 years, MCS champions protection for marine wildlife, sustainable fisheries and clean seas and beaches.

New Business and Industry Contract at Redgate Software in Cambridge    From L to R: The Redgate Catering Team: Jonas, Pawel, Margaret, Chris and Operations Manager, Jack.  T(n)S are delighted to announce that our latest business and industry contract has opened in Cambridge.  Redgate Software, based on Cambridge Business Park, employ approximately 200 people at their headquarters in the UK, they have another office in the USA.  Redgate make software developed to be the world’s most trusted tools for SQL Server development and administration. It’s all about “simple communications” which might be why they all communicate via post-it notes all over the offices! We all think Redgate is a cool place to work, with a fun vibrant atmosphere.  The big thing to note is that all food and drink is free to the employees, which includes breakfast, lunch and all tea, coffee and juices.  We employ four staff members based in the restaurant; Chef Manager, Chris, is very experienced, having worked in the catering industry for many years. Margaret (who really runs the joint) has been at Redgate since 2007. Pawel, recently promoted to Assistant Chef, has been at Redgate since 2009 and is enrolled on our T(n)S Chef’s Academy training plan. Jonas has been at Redgate for 3½ years and loves to confuse our support manager, Paul, by talking to him in Russian.  Jaime Doig from Redgate said: “This was the first time we had been through the tender process since we first launched our restaurant back in 2009, so when we handed the reigns to T(n)S we were in new territory. However, I felt incredibly at ease with their plans to relaunch the restaurant and I believe this is down to their friendly and personable nature. T(n)S understood exactly what we wanted and collaborated with us perfectly, and we built up a very good working relationship from the start. The detail that went into the relaunch was beautiful and our relaunch week went amazingly well – staff were totally wowed, and most importantly the food tasted great.”  To quote our Operations Manager, Jack Sturdy: “From the very first visit, it was clear that we were dealing with like-minded people at Redgate. I feel that our company values and personalities are well aligned, and this is helping to form a strong relationship from the outset. Our opening menu developments and promotional ideas have been very well received, with some really positive comments from customers appearing on our comments board every week.”  We are very proud and excited to be working with Redgate to provide a truly valued partnership going forward.

The Tash Is Back!    “Can you keep a secret?” one of the marketing & brand organizers asked us. (Us being a three strong T(n)S Catering team located at Go Compare, Newport Wales.)    “What do you mean?” we asked.    “We would like you to provide a free lunch for everyone on site, Italian themed followed by Buck’s fizz & Cornetto’s but I can’t tell you why!”    So on Thursday the event was staged.    An Events company came & dressed the restaurant with a backdrop of sparkling black floor to ceiling curtains, (like a stage set) rows & rows of ornate chairs waiting to be filled.    Then the secret was out… it was to be the prelaunch of Go Compare’s new advert and the comeback performance of the man with the tash, Gio Compario aka Welsh opera singer Wynne Evans!    We served the meal in three sittings with high praise all around as well as empty plates! We served a selection of pasta dishes including, tortellini, Lasagne & Spaghetti Carbonara, various pizzas, ciabatta garlic bread & side salads.    However the main event everyone was waiting for finally arrived, at 3pm the restaurant became awash with people. Buck’s Fizz was served as well as Cornetto’s to eager & excited workers. Whispers started among the rows of chairs, and hand held moustaches were handed out – a clue?    Lights go down, silence… then it starts…    The new advert – wow, he’s back! Love Him or hate him he’s the brand!    The advert sounded good however the best was to come. Our very own mini advert/concert with the man himself on stage. OUR STAGE!! Belting out rousing comparison themed arias.    Apart from the odd slurp of Buck’s Fizz or lick of Cornetto, everyone was spellbound & transfixed.    The advertisement aired to over 8.7 million on its opening night. It featured a new version of the iconic ‘Go Compare.com’ song however we feel very privileged to have heard it live… something we won’t forget.     Ride for Life Beyond Sight Loss!    Our very own Phil Tyas, and H.O.G. member from the Rolling Hills Chapter will be riding across four counties in one day to raise money for Blind Veterans UK, and he’s encouraging other Harley-Davidson owners to join him!    On Saturday 15th August, Phil, along with his wife Tracy will be riding his 2008 FLSTF Fat Boy during the Ride for Life Beyond Sight Loss, the charity’s second annual motorcycling event. He will be riding from his home in Llangrove, Herefordshire, to Gloucestershire, and will then continue his journey 140 miles to Brighton, before returning to Llangrove later that evening.    Phil was inspired to join the ride by the experience of his late grandfather who was blinded in an explosion during World War I.

Interesting Facts and Trivia    Pale yellow or ivory in colour and shaped like a slightly bulbous carrot, parsnips are one of the tastiest and most appealing root vegetables. Cheap and simple to prepare, their soft, fragrant, slightly sweet flesh adds a warm, comforting element to dishes.    Parsnips have been cultivated by humans for at least 2,000 years. In ancient times parsnips and carrots were often referred to by the same name (pastinaca was used by Pliny to describe both).    Flavour and sweetness are increased by frost, so parsnips are better during mid/late winter or from December through to February.    The parsnip’s unique flavour comes when its starches change to sugar. This happens after the first frost, when the vegetable is still in the ground.    In Europe, parsnips were used to sweeten jams and cakes before sugar was widely available.    It’s no coincidence that the parsnip resembles the carrot. The two veggies are close relatives.    But it’s not related to the “cow parsnip,” which is a member of the parsley family.    Half a cup of sliced, cooked parsnips has 3 grams of fiber and only 55 calories. They are a good source of vitamin C (11% of the recommended daily allowance), folate (11%), and manganese (10%).    Parsnips are native to Europe and Asia and were introduced to North America in the 17th century.    Keep in a perforated, unsealed plastic bag in the bottom of the fridge. They can last for 2 or 3 weeks but keep a check and use them before they get soft or withered.

Ingredients for the filling    225g good quality dark chocolate, broken into pieces  1tbsp brandy  2 large free-range eggs, separated  350ml double cream  3tbsp Baileys Irish cream  2tbsp icing sugar  8 to 12 physalis  50g dark chocolate, melted  50g white chocolate, melted     Method  1. First, make the sponge. Heat the oven to 180 C, 160 C fan, 350 F, gas 4. Put the egg yolks and sugar into a large bowl and beat with an electric hand whisk until the mixture is thick and pale, and the whisk leaves a trail. Sift the cocoa and fold it in with a hand whisk.  2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks – the mix will just hold up when you lift it with the whisk. Take a large spoonful of the egg whites and stir them into the egg yolk mix to loosen it. Now fold in the rest of the egg whites. Take care not to knock all the air out. Pour it into the tin, then bake for around 20 minutes. It should be risen and springy to the touch. Let it cool in the tin.  3. Meanwhile, make the mousse filling. Place the chocolate, brandy and 25ml (1fl oz) water in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Warm on a low heat until the chocolate has melted, then leave to cool for 5 minutes. In a small, clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Add the egg yolks to the chocolate mixture one at a time, beating well after each addition. Whip 150ml (1 quarter pt) of the cream, then fold into the chocolate. Fold in the egg whites in 2 batches. Put the mousse to one side. Make the Baileys cream by whipping the remainder of the cream with the Baileys and the icing sugar to form soft peaks.  4. To assemble the roulade, sprinkle a large piece of greaseproof with cocoa and flip the sponge over on to it. The top of the sponge should be touching the greaseproof. Remove the lining paper. We rolled this roulade using the short side to make it thicker. For smaller pieces, roll from the long side. Spread the chocolate mousse in a thick layer all over the sponge, making sure it goes right to the edge of the long sides. If the mousse is too firm to spread, dip a palette knife in hot water and use that. Top with the Baileys cream in a smooth layer. With one of the short sides nearest to you, and using the greaseproof to help, roll the roulade firmly and fairly tightly away from you, so that it forms a short, fat roll. Don’t worry if it cracks – it adds to the look. Leave the roulade wrapped in the greaseproof in the fridge overnight to firm up.  5. While it’s chilling, carefully pull up the physalis leaves, so they resemble wings. Dip half into the dark chocolate and half into the white, then rest on a sheet of greaseproof in a cool place until the chocolate has set. To serve the roulade, carefully remove the greaseproof and cut the very end of using a sharp knife to give you a neat edge. Transfer to a serving plate and balance the physalis in alternating dark and white along the top. Dust lightly all over with icing sugar and serve in thin slices.

Interesting Facts and Trivia    In 1971, a group of high echelon managers at Gilbey’s of Ireland had the idea for a unique Irish drink.  No one had managed to blend cream and whiskey before and the first Bailey’s Irish Cream appeared in a ten gallon milk churn.    It took three years of patient work, plus a little chocolate and vanilla, to create the truly amazing taste. Finally, on November 26th 1974, by way of an accident, Bailey’s Irish Cream Liqueur was born.    Baileys only uses milk from Irish cows and a lot of it. The brand goes through 72.6 million gallons of milk a year.    The liqueur is so popular that people around the world drink 2,300 glasses of it every minute of every day.
