Research shows that companies which have better gender diversity are also more likely to show better financial results.  At Steinhoff UK, we are confident that men and women are paid equally when working in equivalent roles and we welcome the introduction of gender pay gap reporting.  At the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, the overall difference between average male and female earnings is 12.6% (mean) or 7.5% (median), based on hourly rates of pay. Whilst our gap is better than the UK average of 18.1%, we strive to close the gap entirely.  As a leadership team, we are committed to proactively challenging ourselves about the underlying reasons for the gap and are working across the business to address it. Steinhoff UK Retail has more men than women at all levels and this is particularly pronounced at senior levels. Our gender pay gap of 12.6%, like most organisations in the UK, is primarily caused by having fewer women in senior more highly paid roles.  We want to be sure that we fully maximise the talents of all our people. We have recently run insightful sessions with female employees in management roles to better understand where our opportunities lie to maximise gender diversity. We want to recruit more women right across our business and to ensure that there is an opportunity for them to progress. These are helping to inform our plans.  It has been reported that the gap in gender pay in the UK is likely to exist until 2040. At Steinhoff UK we are committed to closing our gender pay gap within a much more ambitious time-frame.  I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate.
