Our first retailer was opened in Sawston, Cambridgeshire in 1960.  Until April 2013, the Company was jointly managed by Frank’s sons, Gary and Nigel; who had both been involved in the business from a very young age. Astute businessmen; their passion for motor vehicles, and the core family values they instilled into the company resulted in the continued development that the Group has enjoyed. The loss of Nigel through illness in April 2013 was a loss not only to his family but to every employee within the Vindis Group.  In May 2013, Gary Vindis announced the appointment of his son, Jamie, into the position of Managing Director, from his role as Operations Director for the Group. Jamie’s focus is on continuing to deliver Gary and Nigel’s aspirations for the Group and to support Gary in his position as Chairman.  Vindis Group is a family owned business that has grown by delivering both a personal and professional service. We have a network of Audi, Bentley, ŠKODA, Volkswagen and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicle retailers, spanning six counties. In 2016, Vindis Group announced the launch of two new Ducati stores to its portfolio and also acquired Milton Keynes SEAT.  In addition, we have two trade parts divisions located in Bishop’s Stortford and Cambridge; a Head Office function in Huntingdon; and a large Fleet Centre situated at Alconbury Weald. Whilst we have continued to expand, we have been careful to nurture the core family values our business was founded upon.  The Vindis Vision The Group today focuses on our vision:  We are committed to delivering customer service that is truly experiential. Our specialist Sales Executives and Service Advisors are trained to ensure that the experience you have in any one of our dealerships is one of extreme satisfaction. In particular, the experience of purchasing a vehicle is one that should be enjoyable and our intention is to help you find the perfect vehicle for you.  It is not our intention to be the biggest motor group in the UK but to be the most recognised for our commitment to exceeding both business objectives, and customer expectations.  We look forward to welcoming you to a Vindis Group retailer in the near future.
