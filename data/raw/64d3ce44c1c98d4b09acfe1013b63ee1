For the same role, regardless of gender, all our hourly paid employees are paid the same hourly rate.    Our analysis shows that our Gender Pay gap is fairly equal across the organisation, however it shows in the upper quartile that we employ more male employee’s in the more technical roles, moving forward we can assess this gap on recruitment dependent on career choice.
