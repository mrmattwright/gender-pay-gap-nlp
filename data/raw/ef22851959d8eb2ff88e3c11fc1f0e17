The Gender Pay Gap does not compare men and women in like-for-like roles, but it does highlight that there are less women in more senior positions within the company than men. This is something that we are committed to improving.  At 16.1% our Gender Pay Gap is less than the that of the UK overall, however we firmly believe that this can be reduced further.  O’Neill & Brennan will endeavour in this aim by maintaining recruitment processes that are free from bias. To help us attract more women to work within the industry, we are creating roles that allow the option of flexible working. In addition, we have started to introduce more benefits that would appeal to women and we have increased our annual leave entitlement.  We believe that by attracting more female candidates and then by providing excellent training and development programmes, over time more women will excel and rise to senior positions within the company.
