gender pay gap 

report 2017

We believe in creating a workforce that reﬂ ects
our customers and the communities we serve
and helping our team members be the best
they can be.

We recognise how important it is to recruit the 
right team members and as we continue to grow, 
we’ll have opportunities across lots of different 
areas of the business. Wherever we can, we’ll 
look to develop our people internally through 
great training and development. Our recruitment 
policy helps ensure we meet our commitment 
to equal opportunities and diversity. In our recent 
engagement survey, 88% of team members said 
that ‘everyone is welcome at wilko and treated 
equally, regardless of their culture, background, 
sexual orientation, gender, age, sex, or if they 
have a disability’.

We’ll continue to challenge ourselves to be more 
inclusive and understand the challenges our team 
members face so that we can look at how we 
overcome these. We’ll do this by continuing to listen 
to our team members through our listening forums, 
In The Loop and our recognised trade union,
the GMB.

New legislation came into force in April 2017 which 
requires a UK employer with 250 employees or 
more to publish their gender pay gap each year. 
The gender pay gap has to be calculated based 
on pay information as at 5 April 2017. So our ﬁ rst 
gender pay gap report is for wilko retail ltd based 
on 5 April 2017. Our gender pay gap report next 
year will be based on the new group structure.

At wilko, every single team member plays a part in 
delivering our strategic plan, helping us to create a
world where stuff gets done – no matter how big or 
small. From people who stack and shift product to
those who serve and smile at every customer on
every visit, our people are at the heart of everything
we do and without their support we wouldn’t be 
able to deliver great products at great prices.

We all share a common value, in that we’re 
people who want the best for you and we love 
nothing more than helping our customers get stuff 
sorted. But what gets us equally excited is when we 
can support our team members to get everything 
they want too – whether that’s career progression, 
personal development, ﬂ exible working or a work 
life balance. 

88%of our team members said 

everyone is welcome at wilko and 
treated equally, regardless of their 
culture, background, sexual orientation, 
gender, age, sex, or if they have 
a disability.

Intro

What is the gender pay gap?

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average hourly* rate of pay between

women and men in a company. A gap may exist because different jobs pay 
different rates of pay and the number of women and men in those jobs varies. 

A gender pay gap is not unlawful.

Gender pay is different to equal pay, which is where women and men are paid

differently for doing the same or similar job. This is unlawful.

How is the gender pay gap calculated?

Median (the middle)
hourly pay gap
If we lined up all of our female team
members from lowest to highest paid and
did the same with our male team members,
the median gender pay gap is the difference
in hourly pay between the female and the
male in the middle of their lines.

Mean (the average)
hourly pay gap
If we add up all the hourly rates of pay for
our female team members and divide that
by the number of female team members
we have in the company that gives us the
average hourly rate of pay for a female
team member. If we then do the same
for our male team members, the difference
between the female and the male average 
rate of pay is the mean gender pay gap.

(the minus % means that on average our female team members

were paid a higher ‘bonus’ than our male team members) 

Although we didn’t pay a cash bonus to our team members in 2017, the gender pay gap legislation recognises things like our £10 celebratory voucher 
and long service awards as a bonus which is why we have such a high percentage of our female and male team members that received a ‘bonus’.

What we are already doing to be a more inclusive employer

Flexible working

At wilko, we appreciate the diverse needs of our team members 
and we encourage open conversation. We look at individual needs 
and circumstances and how we can best help our team members 
to balance their work life with personal responsibilities. We offer a range 
of ﬂ exible working options, including career break, term time/holiday 
working, home working, job share, part-time
working, along with maternity, paternity,
adoption, fertility and shared parental leave.

Training and 
development

Our team members have an important role to 
play in the success of our business and we believe 
that by investing in training and development, we’ll be able to provide
our team members with the knowledge and skills, to not only do their job,
but also fulﬁ l their potential.

Diversity and 
inclusion

We employ a diverse range of team members and we’re 
totally committed to applying our equal opportunities and 
diversity principles at all stages of the recruitment process right 
up to retirement. We employ the right people to do the job, 
regardless of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, 
ethnic or national origin, gender reassignment, marital status, 
trade union membership, part-time working or age.

“One of the things I absolutely love about working for wilko 
is that they understand that there are points in people’s 
lives where ﬂ exibility is required. I am a mum of one and 
soon to be a mum of two. Wilko has enabled me to have 
the best of both worlds, the ability to be an amazing 
mum whilst maintaining my career ambitions. I job share 
and by working only three days, I am able to balance 
demanding roles in both my home and work life. 
Wilko values your skills and experience and understands 
that working part time doesn’t mean that you have to put 
your career on hold.”
Rebecca Clarke, 
Culture and Performance Partner, HR

A group of our talented team members took on 
The Prince’s Trust Million Makers challenge, as part of 
our Aspire development programme. The team came 
up with a great idea and developed a re-usable bag 
to sell in our stores with all the net proceeds going 
to the charity. The team raised over £50,000 and 
were crowned winners of the Yorkshire and Humber 
Challenge. They were also invited to The Prince’s Trust 
Success Awards where they won third place in the ﬁ nal 
and were awarded the national teamwork award.

and development programmes in 2017

“I’ve worked for wilko for almost 20 years and for me what makes wilko 
a great place to work is its commitment, understanding and ﬂ exibility 
towards team members. During the last six years, since having my 
children, I’ve worked part time and this hasn’t had a negative impact 
on my career development at all. This year I was selected and 
passed the Aspire development programme which 
has put me in great stead for the next step in my career. I’ve been 
able to take part in this great opportunity as well as maintaining 
a great work life balance.”

Trade Planning Manager

What have we 
done so far…

As a retail business we decided to focus on 
our stores ﬁ rst and we’ve started with store 
management. We want to be an inclusive 
employer and so we need to understand 
what we get right and what we could
be better at. 

We ran listening groups with some of our 
store management and they gave us some 
really clear areas for us to improve on.

Results

•  Simplify processes and materials that 
better support our store management
in progressing their careers with wilko

•  Improve our senior retail

management team skills in spotting
and developing talent

•  Create opportunities that support 

balancing career progression
with family life

Our current plan…

Our long-term plan…

We have a plan to help to address these areas 
and we’ve outlined this below. There are some 
areas that we can make improvements in quickly 
and others will take some time to work through 
and implement. We will make sure that all of the 
feedback from the listening groups is explored as 
we aim to create a transparent talent approach
that engages team members.

Our long-term plan is to run these listening groups across 
the business to help us achieve our three main commitments 
to our team members:
•  Improve our 2017 engagement survey results where 

88% of our team members feel welcome at wilko and 
are treated equally

•  An agile and ﬂ exible workplace that enables team members 

to balance their work life with personal responsibilities 

•  An inclusive culture that enables our team members to be 

the best they can be

are working 
on now

will be 
doing next

Encourage inclusion through 
workshops and sponsors

•  Starting with a Directors workshop in May 2018 on 

diversity and inclusion

•  Introducing a digital booklet that helps our team 

members understand how they can progress their 
careers in retail and/or across the wider business
•  Making better use of opportunities for our store 

management teams to get an insight into more 
senior roles

•  Part of our senior retail management training will 

include how to spot and develop talent

•  Exploring part time 
store management 
positions and job share 
opportunities

Reviewing
our interview 
process

I conﬁ rm that wilko’s 
gender pay gap 
calculations are 
accurate and have 
been collated in 
accordance with 
the requirements 
of The Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay 
Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017.

This statement was 
approved by wilko 
retail ltd.
