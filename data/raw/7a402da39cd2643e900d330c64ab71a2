Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
 
Trinity  Multi  Academy  Trust  are  an  employer  required  by  law  to  carry  out  Gender  Pay 
Reporting  under  the  Equality  Act  2010  (Gender  Pay  Gap  Information)  Regulations  2017.  
This  involves  carrying  out  six  calculations  that  show  the  difference  between  the  average 
earnings of men and women in our organisation but does not involve publishing individual 
employees data. 
 
We are required to publish the results on our own website and to a government website.  As 
a public sector employer we will do this within one calendar year of 31 March, from 31 March 
2017. 
 
We can use these results to assess: 
• 
• 
•  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded. 
 
Gender  Pay  Reporting  requires  us  to  make  calculations  based  on  employee  gender.  We 
have done this by using our existing HR and payroll records.   
 
Hourly rate for teaching staff is calculated on a 1/1265th basis of the annual full time salary.  
Support staff hourly rate is published in JCNC scales.   
 
We are confident that Trinity trust’s gender pay gap is not a pay issue, we know this because 
our  approach  to  pay  is  gender  neutral  and  we  have  in  place  job  evaluation  structures  to 
ensure  there  is  pay  parity  across  the  trust.    We  use  pay  scales  based  on  the  School 
Teachers Pay and Conditions Document and for non-teaching staff we use pay scales set by 
the NJC.   
 
On  the  snapshot  date/period  there  were  399 full-pay  relevant  employees.    31% male  and 
69% female staff. 
 
In  the  four  quartiles  there  is  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  women  in  the  Lower  and 
Lower  Middle  Quartile.    This  indicates  that  a  higher  proportion  of  women  are  in  the  more 
junior grades.  In the Upper and Upper Middle quartiles there is a high proportion of female 
staff, showing in the higher pay levels women are represented strongly.  
 
The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay that male and female full-pay relevant 
employees receive is 26.89%.  The difference between the median hourly rate of pay that 
male and female full-pay relevant employees receive is 44.67%.   
 
One male employee received a bonus, therefore the gap for mean and median pay is 100%. 
 
For further analysis the staffing groups are broken down as follows: 
 
•  Senior  Leadership.    This  group  includes  the  trust  executive  team,  Principals,  Vice 

Principals, Assistant Principals and other named Senior Leaders.   

•  Middle  Leadership.    This  group  includes  trust  leaders,  teachers  in  leadership  posts  or 

TLR holders.  It does not include support staff who are middle leaders. 

•  Teachers.  This group are classroom teachers. 
•  Support staff.  All other non-teaching staff.

A breakdown by role type shows: 
 
•  Although there are the same number of M/F staff in senior leader roles Male staff earn 

37.73% more than their female counterparts. 

• 

•  Within middle leaders and classroom teachers there are more women than men in these 
roles.    The  mean  hourly  rate  indicates  that  there  is  a  less  than  1%  pay  gap  in  these 
groups.   
In middle leadership the median hourly rate is lower for women (although there are more 
of them), indicating that the fewer male staff earn, on average, more than their female 
counterparts.    Across  classroom  teachers  the  median  hourly  rate  is  slightly  more  for 
women, but this is less than 1%. 

•  There is a significantly higher proportion of females in non-teaching support roles (76% 

female staff).  The pay gap for women in these roles is 11.67%. 

 
The gender pay gap exists in two significant areas: 
•  Senior Leadership.  There is balance between female and male leaders. However, male 

staff earn on average nearly 40% more than their female counterparts.   

•  Support staff.  The group is made up of 34% male staff who earn (on average per hour) 

11.67% more than their female counterparts. 

 
Although  the  majority  of  women  are  in  junior  grades,  there  is  a  significant  percentage  of 
women in middle leader roles, therefore the organisation should consider how it can support 
the leadership development of these female staff to the higher paid senior roles.
