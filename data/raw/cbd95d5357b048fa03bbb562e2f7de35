Ensuring equality
At Ericsson, we work proactively 
to improve diversity and 
inclusion globally.
Our goal is to encourage a gender-intelligent 
organization which recognizes and values the 
differences that both men and women bring 
to the business. 
Over the past few years, Ericsson has made 
steady progress in increasing the number of 
women at senior-level positions.

We welcome the introduction of
new legislation by the UK Government
that requires all companies in the UK with 250 or 
more employees to publish their gender pay 
gap* data.

*The gender pay gap differs from equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between 
men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful 
to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The Gender Pay Gap shows the 
differences in the average pay between men and women. If a workplace has a particularly high 
gender pay gap, this can indicate that there may be a number  of issues to deal with, and the 
individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are. In some cases, the gender 
pay gap may include unlawful inequality in pay but this is not necessarily the case.

Ericsson TTE in numbers

Ericsson Television, Ltd. (TTE) represents 
Ericsson’s core media solutions business 
in the UK.
Ericsson Television Ltd, Ericsson’s Media Solutions 
business in the UK, reported a mean pay gap of 32.5% 
and a median pay gap of 30.0%. 
We believe this is predominately due to the majority of 
roles within the business being technical. It is widely 
publicised that there is a disproportionate number of 
females within the engineering and technology 
sectors. This finding is true within our organisation. As 
such, the low number of females employed within our 
business has impacted our Gender Pay Gap.

Committed to closing the gap

Ericsson Television 
Ltd. is wholly 
committed to 
closing the gap in 
gender pay in the 
UK and we realise
there is a great 
deal more work to 
be done to bridge 
the gap in our 
business.

We are currently working in partnership with the Engineering 
Development Trust, promoting STEM in schools, colleges, and 
universities with the aim to encourage young girls into engineering 
at an early age.
On January 31, 2018, Ericsson partnered with One Equity Partners.  
As such, Ericsson Media Solutions, which is currently part of 
Ericsson. will become a part of a separate global company. 
Ericsson Television Ltd. will be included under the new terms.
As part of this transition, Ericsson Television Ltd. will work to place 
a significant focus on attracting and retaining females into the 
business.

Moving towards the future

Moving forward,  we will be reviewing our internal policies and practices for 
recruitment and internal career opportunities to support and help address the 
gender pay gap. Our ambition is to have a much better gender-balanced 
workforce at all levels in the organisation.
