GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

“

Being  an  inclusive  and  diverse  business  is  critical  to  our  success.  Diversity  fosters  better  decision 
making, enriches our talent pool and drives innovation.

This gender pay gap report reflects the fact that we have more work to do to increase the number 
of women in our most highly paid roles. We already have a number of targeted programmes and 
initiatives underway to increase the number of women in senior roles and are committed to making 
progress in this regard.

Understanding the gender pay gap
Is the gender pay gap the same as equal pay? 
No. They are two separate matters, as explained below.

What is the gender pay gap? 
The gender pay gap concerns the hourly pay of all men who work in 
a company compared to the hourly pay of all women who work in the 
same company. It does not account for different types of jobs or levels 
of seniority.

What is equal pay?
Equal pay is when a man and a woman are paid the same for doing the 
same or similar work. We take our moral and legal responsibilities on 
equal pay seriously, and conduct reviews regularly to ensure salary and 
bonus decisions are fair and gender neutral.

There are two main reasons for the gender pay gap both across the financial services 
industry and at BNP Paribas Securities Services: 
£  There are more men than women in senior positions.
£  The higher salaries that senior roles attract, relative to other positions, significantly 
increases the average male pay both in the market and at BNP Paribas Securities 
Services.

Overall, we have significantly higher mean and median bonus gaps than hourly pay gaps. 
This is because:
£  Bonus amounts tend to increase with seniority and we currently have more men than 
women in senior roles and roles which typically attract larger bonus opportunities.
£  More of our part-time employees are women. The calculation for the bonus gap does 

not account for bonuses being pro-rated for part-time employees.

Population by quartile 
Pay quartiles are calculated by ranking the hourly pay of all staff, then splitting the range 
into four equal quartiles and calculating the proportion of men and woman in each quartile.  
The higher proportion of men in the upper quartiles reflects the fact that there are more men 
than women in senior positions, which attract higher rates of pay.
