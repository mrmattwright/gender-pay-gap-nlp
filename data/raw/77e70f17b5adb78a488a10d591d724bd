UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017            Home » Gender Pay Report   Impact of our vision and values  BuroHappold strives to be a diverse and inclusive practice that reflets the varied communities and clients we serve. Our vision is to ensure that all our people are given the support and opportunities they need to reach or exceed their potential.  We welcome the UK Gender Pay Gap Report as a chance to examine the reach of the initiatives we have in place to address gender bias, highlight the challenges we face, and achieve greater gender equality in our practice and the wider engineering industry.  “We are a diverse, one-firm culture. When we get it right, it sings. Internal barriers are always to be overcome through inclusivity.”  From the BuroHappold Principles      ‘We confirm the information and data reported is accurate as of the snapshot date 5 th April 2017’       Neil Squibbs Chief Executive Officer BuroHappold Engineering     Misti Melville Global HR Director BuroHappold Engineering       What is the Gender Pay Report?  As part of the UK government’s approach to achieving gender equality, all employers with more than 250 employees must collect and publish data on the difference between their average male and female salaries, as of 5th April 2017.  Following the required reporting, this Gender Pay Gap Report focuses on hourly pay and bonuses paid to both male and female employees, and examines:  •  Mean and median hourly pay  •  Mean and median bonuses  •  Proportion of males and females receiving bonus  •  Pay distribution by gender.    The numbers       Hourly pay rates and bonus payments  Difference between males and females   The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average earnings of male and female employees and is expressed as a percentage of male earnings (e.g. females earn X% less than male employees). The data is taken as per the regulations requirements, from a ‘snap shot’ date of 5th April 2017 and so does not represent our current position. The results show there is a 0.9% variation between mean and median hourly pay.    Proportion of employees receiving a bonus   In accordance with the regulations, the calculations are taken from the 12 month period ending 5th April 2017, hence they are 2016’s bonus payments. The results show that 3.3% more male employees received bonuses than female employees. As the majority of our technical staff are male, and the majority of our non-technical staff female, this has resulted in more male employees overall receiving a bonus.      Pay quartiles – proportion of males and females in each quartile band      Our findings       Historically, more males have been drawn to careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) industries, so it is not surprising that the findings of our report echo the greater gender pay gap found across the engineering sector.    BuroHappold has been working to address this imbalance for many years, and we are proud of our efforts to effect meaningful change.  Our gender split for technical/senior roles already exceeds the UK standard, with 24% of these positions occupied by females, despite females accounting for only 11% of the engineering population across the UK.      ↓ Download the report (PDF)        What our leaders say... “This report focuses on understanding and explaining the gender pay gap in our UK business. As a global practice, we think it is also equally important to understand the gap in the rest of the world where we operate.  According to the most recent World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report, it will take 170 years to completely close the overall gender pay gap across all industries and countries around the world. This sobering finding ‘from more than a decade of data has revealed that progress is still too slow for realising the full potential of one half of humanity within our lifetimes.’  Our intent is to take action ourselves and influence the communities in which we operate in order to not only close the gender pay gap but to generally encourage diversity and inclusion in every form.”  Misti Melville, Global HR Director   “This report provides us with a UK wide benchmark, that not only allows us to compare ourselves with our peer firms, but also a point from which we can measure our progress.  We work in an industry which is very reliant on education in STEM subjects, an area which has traditionally not had anything like gender parity in terms of numbers participating. Therefore, our challenge is to not only ensure that our own internal practices provide equality of opportunity to all but we recognise our responsibility to influence externally to ensure that our industry truly reflects the society in which we live.  Neil Squibbs, Chief Executive Officer    “Improving the representation of women in the upper pay quartiles is imperative. This will require dedication and the involvement of all of us, as we actively foster and promote a culture of inclusion and equality for everyone.”  Dr. Sarah Prichard, UK Engineering & Operations Director        Change comes from within  The data we have gathered as part of this UK Gender Pay Gap Report has played a critical role in helping us understand the impact of our policies and practices. It has also proved invaluable in helping us identify areas for improvement so that we can continue to work towards achieving greater diversity and greater gender balance.  To create significant impact, we must work together to make BuroHappold an inclusive environment and this is why we are committed to encouraging far-reaching cultural change across the practice, in every discipline, and at every level.     Closing the gap  As a signatory of the Women In Engineering and Science (WISE) Ten Steps we are committed to improving our internal practices with a view to ensure our female engineers are afforded the same opportunities to progress as their male counterparts. We recognise the need to continue to nurture, develop and promote female talent within our practice. We will progress existing successful approaches, which include:      Graduate intake  Our graduate intake for 2017 comprised an almost 50/50 split of males and females.  Returner programme  We will be refreshing a Maternity Returners programme in 2018 designed to support women as they return to work after leave.  Manager training  Career conversations with employees of any gender should include discussions around overcoming barriers to progression.  Flexible working  We promote flexible working practices with the aim of providing all employees with options that will allow them to grow and thrive within the business.    Recruitment and selection  Our most recent resourcing data illustrates that a combination of inclusive recruitment practices, manager training and the use of technologies, has enabled us to increase the number of UK female applicants. Although the UK engineering population is 11% female, 22% of applications to our roles were female and the number of female technical hires was 33%, with a 10% increase in the number of senior female hires.  Inclusive leadership  In assisting managers to understand the principles of inclusion and recognise bias, we create an environment where everyone feels welcome, able to be authentic and showcase their talent in diverse teams. Career conversations with employees of any gender should include discussions around potential barriers to progression or development, and how these can be overcome.      ↓ Download the report (PDF)      Want to find out more?
