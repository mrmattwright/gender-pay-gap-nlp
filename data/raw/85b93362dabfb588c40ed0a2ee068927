As a charity, having a diverse workforce is a key part of achieving that vision. Not only is this the right thing to do, but external research has consistently demonstrated diverse teams outperform those teams that are not, across a number of performance indicators.  Our median gender pay gap is 2.7%, compared to the UK national median gender pay gap in 2017 of 18.4% (Office of National Statistics).
