We strive to eliminate any gender bias in our pay and remuneration systems and understand that equal pay between males and females is a moral obligation and a legal right. The information we are required to publish in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 is detailed below.  Mean Pay Gap 18.5%  Median Pay Gap 0.0%  Mean Bonus Pay Gap -30.0%  Median Bonus Pay Gap -30.0%  Males receiving Bonus Pay 0.5% Females receiving Bonus Pay 0.4%  Quartile Distribution Female / Male   Commentary Due to the size and structure of the organisation and the relatively low number of employees the statistics detailed above are susceptible to an element of skewing if there are outliers at either end of the range.  The Mean Gender Pay Gap of 18.5% and the upper quartile consisting of a higher proportion of Males is not an indication that females are paid less than males for similar roles, as evidenced by the Median Gender Pay Gap of 0.0%; rather it is a reflection that of the available roles in the top quartile a higher proportion are currently filled by males. Nonetheless it does identify an area of consideration during staff recruitment and pay reviews.  Conversely the Bonus Pay Gap figures of -30.0% indicate that overall female employees received a larger bonus payment than male employees which further demonstrates that there is no gender bias inherent at the company.
