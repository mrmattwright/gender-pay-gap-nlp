Hanley and Jones Limited Gender Pay Gap Reporting Statement 2. MSG Contracts Limited Gender Pay Gap Reporting Statement    1. Hanley and Jones Limited Gender Pay Gap Reporting Statement  The company’s gender pay gap report for the pay period including the 5 April 2017 is as follows:      Pay quartiles        Male    Female          Band A (lowest)    19.7%    80.3%          Band B    15.4%    84.6%          Band C    14.1%    85.9%          Band D (highest)    28.2%    71.8%                        Mean gender pay gap %    -0.2              Median gender pay gap %    0                                Mean gender bonus gap    N/A              Median gender bonus gap    N/A                                Percentage paid bonus        Nil    Nil         I confirm that the above information is accurate.  Kevin Jones  DIRECTOR  Date: 21/03/2018  EXPLANATORY NOTES  As can be seen from the above quartiles our company is predominantly female and our highest earners are also female.  The majority of our workers are part time employees earning the national living wage.  Whilst the mean figures show that female workers earn slightly more than their male counterparts this figure is slightly skewed by the fact the management team (and thus the higher earners) are predominantly female.  The company does not pay a bonus to any worker.  The company operates an open recruitment policy and all vacancies are suitable for both male and female workers.  The reality is that most of our applicants (and thus workers) are female.  We do not envisage making any changes to our plans or our policies as the current gender pay gap, although very small, is in the favour of female workers.    2.

Rob Wilson  DIRECTOR  Date: 04/04/2018  EXPLANATORY NOTES  Our company employs a majority of  female staff and generally our highest earners are also female.  Our staff are mainly part time employees earning at or above the national living wage.  Whilst the mean figures show that female employees earn very slightly more than their male counterparts this figure is a little distorted by the fact that the majority of our long term office staff are mainly female.  The company does not pay a bonus to any worker.  The company operates an open recruitment policy and all vacancies are suitable for both male and female workers.  The reality is that most of our applicants (and thus workers) are female.  We do not envisage making any changes to our plans or our policies as the current gender pay gap, although very small, is in the favour of female workers.
