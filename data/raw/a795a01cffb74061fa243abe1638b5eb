To support this, our approach to pay is gender neutral by design.  As a business that firmly believes in fairness, equality and inclusion, we are committed to reducing our gender pay gap.  New efforts to improve corporate transparency include a requirement for UK companies with over 250 employees to report publically on their gender pay gap.
