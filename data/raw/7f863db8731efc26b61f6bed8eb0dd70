We are committed to ensuring that all of our employees are given a fair chance to fulfil their potential, without discrimination or prejudice.  Gender Pay Gap legislation requires all companies with 250 or more workers to publish statutory calculations every year showing the size of the pay gap between their male and female employees.  An analysis of our hourly pay rates has shown that average male pay is 47.5% higher than average female pay. This means that the Gender Pay Gap for M&Co is 47.5%. This is driven by the way the measure is calculated, rather than giving a true reflection of pay equality in the company.  The table below sets out the Gender Pay calculation for different parts of our business and shows that in most areas the gap is flat. At board and senior leadership team level, females are well represented and we have many examples of internal promotion and appointment of women into senior roles.   In line with many similar fashion retail companies, the gender pay gap is heavily-influenced by the fact that our stores are staffed by a predominantly female workforce. The majority of our employees (91%) work in stores, where pay rates are typically lower.  Female employees make up 98% of our store workforce and this lowers overall female pay rates. Males make up 6% of the workforce and are situated mainly in Support Office roles, where pay rates are typically higher.  We are confident that women and men are paid equally for doing the equivalent jobs across our business.  We have a number of initiatives across the company that give opportunities for all colleagues to develop their careers at M&Co and we are firmly focused on ensuring that our culture and working environment supports our ambition of being a great place to work. This is reflected in our recent placing as the Sunday Times 14th Best Big Company to Work For in 2017, based on feedback from our employees.
