Governance and CSR       Gender pay report       It's James Fisher's ambition to close the gender pay gap and increase representation of women.  Calculating the gender pay gap:  Private sector organisations which are part of a group must report individually if they qualify as relevant employers under the UK Government’s gender pay gap reporting regulations. James Fisher has two subsidiaries that require separate reporting, James Fisher Nuclear Ltd (JFN) and JFD UK Ltd (JFD).  In the interest of transparency, we are also reporting gender pay gap information for the whole James Fisher Group UK workforce which consists of approximately 1500 people. These Group figures include those individuals in legal entities with fewer than 250 employees.
