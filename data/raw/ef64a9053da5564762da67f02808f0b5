Commentary: 

 

  A  small  disparity  in  mean  and  median  hourly  pay  can  be  explained  by  a  slightly 

higher proportion of male employees in the top quartile of the company’s payroll.  

  There is a fairly even proportion of males and females in the top, upper middle and 

lower quartiles.  

  The  gender  pay  gap  results  across  all  sectors  that  are  available  on  the Gender  Pay 
Gap Service website at the time of publishing (02/03/2018) show that NIAB’s gender 
pay gap results are considerably better than the national average. The comparison of 
the results against the national average is summarised below:
