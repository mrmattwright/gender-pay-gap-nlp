The company was founded in Woodbridge, Suffolk in 1770 and currently employs over 450 people.  The company comprises retail, property, training and business services activities (incorporating security and cleaning services).   Our Gender Pay figures  These figures represent the difference in pay between men and women in our business:  Mean difference (women’s hourly rate is lower) 2 3.8% Median difference (women’s hourly rate is lower)  6.7% Percentage of males who were paid a bonus  57.6% Percentage of females who were paid a bonus 67.4% Mean gender pay gap in bonus pay (women’s bonus pay is lower)  85.2% Median gender pay gap in bonus pay (women’s bonus pay is lower)  42.6%   Distribution of males and females per quartile:  Quartiles  Men  Women Upper  48.3%  51.8% Upper middle  35.1%  64.9% Lower middle  16.7%  83.3% Lower  24.4%  75.7%   As an employer of over 250 members of staff, we are required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting. This is the first year of reporting and we recognise that we do have a gap in our pay between men and women, however we are pleased that our median gap of 6.7% is well below the national average of 18.4%. We will use this information as an opportunity to look at this issue and will actively work to reduce this gap over the next 12 months.  The figures represent a workforce where 69% of the workforce are female and a high majority of our entry level positions are occupied by females as shown in our quartile distribution. We are pleased that the upper quartile shows an almost even split between males and females.  The business works to cultivate a culture where all staff have opportunities to progress and develop in the business. Vacant positions are advertised internally and we actively consider internal promotions when progression opportunities become available.  Our base pay for entry level positions are set using a structured hourly rate system that applies to both males and females.   Looking forward and planning to reduce the gap  Actively promoting flexible work patterns  We pride ourselves on fulfilling the majority of the flexible working requests that we receive in our business. Flexible working requests are generally made by females. We will raise awareness of flexible working in our business to ensure that all staff are educated about the right to request to work flexibly. We will also include a statement on our careers page to inform potential candidates that flexible working can be considered for vacancies.  Internal promotion of vacancies  Our current practice is to promote internal vacancies via our job board. We will actively work to ensure that these are communicated through more channels to ensure all staff have the opportunity view and to apply.  Learning about more senior positions  We will seek to share information in order to create interest in various roles. Due to the limitations that come with the size of our business, it is important that we do this responsibly with the aim of creating interest for when a vacancy arises, rather than create an expectation that moving into other positions is always an option.  Targeting a reduction  Our aim is to reduce the pay gap. At the point of publishing our 2018 figures, we will plan to set a figure that we aim to reduce by.
