GENDER PAY 
REPORT 2018

At Honda we believe that having an inclusive 
workplace where people are treated 
equally is fundamental not only to creating 
an environment where our people feel 
empowered and able to be themselves, 
but is also key to the future success of the 
company. Our fundamental belief is based 
around respect for the individual and as part 
of this, Honda is committed to creating equal 
opportunities for every employee. 

We welcome the UK Government’s  
Gender Pay Gap reporting  
initiative and believe 

transparency of the results across all large 
companies will help to make a positive 
difference moving forward. 

As required by UK legislation, the following 
report will detail our gender pay gap

UK’s National Median Gender Pay Gap

The gender pay gap shows the difference between the 
average earnings of men and women. This is expressed 
as a percentage of men’s earnings. Gender pay gap 
reporting is calculated in both median and mean 
averages. This helps give a more balanced overview  
of the gender pay gap across an organisation.
 
•   The median average is calculated by listing all salaries   
      in numerical order and selecting the middle number (if   
      there is an even number of results, the median will be  
      the mean of the two central numbers).

•   The mean average is calculated by adding up all of  
     the salaries and dividing it by the number of people in    
     an organisation.

The chart above shows the gender pay gap for Honda of 
the UK Manufacturing, alongside the UK’s national gender 
pay gap overall figure for comparison. Our results show 
that the median average pay of our women is 4.49% lower 
than our men, significantly lower than the UK national 
average of 18.1%. 

The gender pay gap differs from equal pay, which is the 
pay difference between men and women who carry out the 
same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.

pay schemes which reward all employees for the
