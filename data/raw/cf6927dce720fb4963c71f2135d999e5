The Act took effect in October 2015. The act applies to all companies selling in the UK that have a global turnover of over EUR 41 million. As this applies to Metsä Group, the law requires Metsä Group to post a public statement each financial year. This statement , published in accordance with section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, outlines the steps Metsä Group has taken during the financial year 2016 to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chain or in any part of our business. Slavery, forced or compulsory labour, child labour, servitude and human trafficking (Modern Slavery) are global and growing issues for which no industry is immune to. Metsä Group is committed to social and environmental responsibility and zero tolerance towards any form of Modern Slavery. The concrete actions taken to ensure that we can live up to this commitment should be viewed in the light of our larger efforts to encourage supply chain transparency, accountability and sustainability.
