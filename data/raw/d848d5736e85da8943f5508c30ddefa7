Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

From now on all businesses employing more than 
250 people must publish their gender pay gap.

The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay.  

Equal pay is a law which says that people doing 
equal jobs should get equal pay, irrespective of 
their gender. Men and women in Amey who do 
equivalent jobs are already being paid equally. 

The gender pay gap is the difference in the average pay of men 
and women in an organisation. It is an indicator of how well the 
company is doing to attract a diverse workforce and making sure 
everyone has the same opportunities to develop their careers.
A pay gap of zero would show that an organisation has the 
same number of men and women, at all levels, receiving 
like-for-like pay. The gender pay gap varies, depending 
on occupation, working pattern and age group.

•  The gender pay gap is not 

the same as equal pay. 
Men and women in Amey 
who do equivalent jobs are 
already being paid equally.

•  Our average (mean) 

gender pay gap is 24%.

•  The main reason for our 

pay gap is that there 
are more men than 
women in technical and 
senior roles at Amey.

•  We’re actively focused 

on closing this gap 
across our business.

What is Amey doing to close the gap? 

Our established Women at Amey network of more 
than 300 members, supports women to develop 
their careers, especially in engineering roles.

We’re investing in specialised leadership training to 
support women to reach the most senior positions.

Our 200+ STEM Ambassadors visit schools and 
colleges across the UK, to inspire girls and people from 
diverse and under-privileged backgrounds to take 
up a career in engineering. Our Queensferry Crossing 
school outreach programme has been developed in 
partnership with ICE (Institute of Civil Engineers).

Collaborating with youth groups like Girlguiding, 
with which we have created, designed and launched 
an Engineering badge this year. Our target is 
to reach 5,000 school girls before 2022.

We offer a wide range of support for people with 
families, including above standard maternity 
and paternity pay, childcare vouchers and 
opportunities to work flexibly. Our Returner 
Programme has been developed with ICE.

Working with experts including business community 
outreach charity BITC and the Rowntree Trust to make 
sure we are supporting those who are earning the least.

Training all of our 1,800 managers in good 
equality practices and unconscious bias.

Reviewing our people policies annually against 
equality standards to ensure fairness.

Understanding our pay gap

The main reason for our pay gap is 
that there are more men than women in 
technical and senior roles at Amey.

This is due to the diverse nature of our business. 
We work in the construction, engineering and technical 
consulting sectors as well as the facilities management 
sector. We know that in these sectors there is a 
gender divide, not just in Amey, but across the UK.

For instance, a lot of our higher paid roles are in science, 
technology and engineering related careers. Only 
23% of these roles are currently held by women in 
the UK. National figures show there are more women 
than men in lower paid and less technical jobs. For 
example, 84% of cleaners in the UK are women.

We are actively focused on closing this divide across 
our business and our Annual Gender Pay Gap 
Report will enable us to track our progress.

Statement and declaration

The gender pay gap we have at Amey is a 
gap driven by a sector-wide issue. 

We are working hard, both internally and 
collaborating across our sectors to break down 
the barriers women face in STEM careers and 
accessing senior roles in the organisation. 

Our gap is a problem that I - supported by my 
Executive Team and Amey employees - am 
committed to addressing as a priority. 

Through continuously improving our internal training, 
development and equality practices and inspiring the 
next generation of engineers with our STEM outreach 
programme and by collaborating with groups 
like Girlguiding, we will make a change.

I confirm the information and data 
reported is accurate as of the 
snapshot date 5 April 2017.

Andy Milner, 
Chief Executive Officer
