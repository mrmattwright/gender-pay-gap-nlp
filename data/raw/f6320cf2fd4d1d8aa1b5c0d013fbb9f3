The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women. The data must be reported before 5 April 2018, for the data held by the firm on the date of 5 April 2017.  The gender pay gap is different from equal pay which is about men and women receiving equal pay for equal work.  As the dates of our pay review and bonus payable is after 5 April each year, the statistics for this report are based on salaries pre pay review 2017 and the bonus figures payable for bonus achieved during the 15/16 period.  Gender pay gap and bonus pay gap  At Hill Dickinson, we have an overall mean hourly rate gender pay gap of 25.9% (median 23.5%) and a bonus pay gap of 69.3% (mean) and 53.4% (median).  An insight into our gender pay and bonus pay gaps  As with many professional service organisations, we are aware of the issues which are attributed to an imbalance in gender pay. In relation to our bonus reporting, there are two significant influencers for this data:  There are a small number of very senior fee earners categorised as employees, who are male and who receive enhanced salary and bonus arrangements.  Non-fee earning senior employees, who were eligible for bonus, were predominantly male in 2015/2016. In support services, only senior managers or directors are eligible to participate in the bonus scheme. This is a small number of employees overall, within what is a predominantly male group.  Our top quartile of earners is broadly balanced between men and women, reinforcing our on-going commitment to employing women in more senior roles.  The gender balance of our non-fee earning senior teams, in all directorates, has changed significantly since 5 April 2016. There are now women in senior roles in IT and finance and whilst HR and marketing have traditionally been a more popular career choice with women in the past, our directors have all been male. This is no longer the case. Going forward the bonus scheme for directors has changed, as has the gender balance.  We provide incentives to all employees such as an additional day’s holiday on birthdays, although the bonus scheme is only currently available to fee earning teams and a small number of senior employees in business support. The bonus scheme was not available to the volume claims division. This accounts for the overall percentage numbers of men and women who received a bonus during the snap shot period.  Our commitment to closing the gender and bonus pay gaps  We are determined over the coming months and years to make progress to reduce the gender pay gap and bonus percentages but we know realistically this will take time. There will be further questioning and rigour applied to pay review and bonus decisions, ensuring all criteria is applied consistently.  We recognise that gender balance is both crucial and beneficial to the success of any business. It is not just morally and ethically the right thing to do, but it will ultimately create a better firm, with increased levels of employee engagement and will ensure we attract, recruit and retain outstanding talent across all levels of the business leading to our clients being provided with a higher level of service.  Over the past 12 months we have rolled out a number of diversity and inclusion initiatives across the business and have made some good progress but we acknowledge there is still a long way to go. The current initiatives we have in place and the new ones we are looking to roll out shortly are not limited to issues around the pay gap but are more focussed on supporting our women to thrive and progress to senior roles across all areas of the business.  What are we doing to close the gaps?  We have working parties in place to address the following key agendas:  Equality leads across the firm  Setting and monitoring our aspirational targets in relation to partners and legal directors  Developing a client code of conduct  Monthly story board, focussing on our employees and diversity  Setting up of a tender project team  Exploring mentoring and reverse mentoring scheme  Commitment to address the gender pay gap  Promoting agile and flexible working  Commitment to address any bias in promotions, recruitment, selection and client events  Launching ‘Parenting Matters’  Overall we are determined to improve our figures and we will continue to develop ideas and initiatives to do this. We will continue to have working parties involved in the decisions that we make whilst appreciating that there are no short-term quick fixes or solutions. This is a long-term issue which demands long- term thinking. We know that there is a lot to do but we want to get it right and we are committed to reducing both our gender pay gap and our gender bonus gap.            Stay informed.
