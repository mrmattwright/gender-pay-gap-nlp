Protecting People. Enhancing Lives.

Our Gender Pay Gap Report 
For 2017

Forward

At Rentokil Initial, our ambition is to become a world-class employer of choice. We 
believe that by doing what’s right for our colleagues we will in turn deliver a brilliant 
service for our customers and ultimately create shareholder value. This is at the heart 
of our RIGHT WAY plan.

Creating a diverse and gender balanced workforce is part of putting this plan into 
action. We value diversity and inclusion and Rentokil Initial is committed to treating all 
colleagues with fairness, dignity and respect. 

This report shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap for all UK colleagues 
based on hourly rates of pay.  It also captures the mean and median difference 
between bonuses paid to men and women. For added transparency, we have reported 
our data using four quartiles from the lowest paid quartile to highest paid.  

Rentokil Initial has had a global grading and reward structure in place for several 
years, supporting the principles of fairness and equity. This can be evidenced by the 
absence of a gender gap between men and women (0% mean, -2% median) versus 
the national median gender pay gap for full-time employees that now stands at 9.1% 
according to the Office for National Statistics (as at October 2017).

Over the following pages we also provide a breakdown of the results for our three UK 
businesses, which have over 250 employees. 

While these are encouraging results overall, and align with our recent employee survey 
where 95% of colleagues believe that we do not preclude male and female colleagues 
from having equal opportunities to succeed, we remain focused on making Rentokil 
Initial an even more diverse and inclusive place to work in line with our RIGHT WAY 
plan.  

We confirm that the information provided in this report is accurate and in line with 
mandatory requirements.

The table above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap for all UK 
colleagues based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date, 5 April 2017. It also 
captures the mean and median difference between bonuses paid to men and women in 
the year up to 31 March 2017, i.e. for the 2016 performance year and in the 12 months to 
31 March 2017.

Rentokil Initial has had a global grading and reward structure in place for several years, 
which supports the principles of fairness and equity, and as a result we are confident that 
men and women are paid and rewarded similarly for doing equivalent jobs across the UK 
business. This can be evidenced by the low gender pay gaps recorded for hourly pay.

When looking at the bonus results, where the gap is more pronounced, this is due mainly 
to there being more men in senior roles who command higher short and long-term 
variable pay opportunities, in line with our global grading and reward system. We are 
currently seeking to address this by recruiting, developing and internally promoting more 
women into senior roles.

The above image illustrates the gender distribution at Rentokil Initial in the UK across 
four equally sized quartiles, each containing around 820 colleagues, and the pay gap 
between men and women in each quartile.

Rentokil Initial is committed to addressing gender diversity and we are approaching this 
in a number of ways including:

•  Building our employer value proposition to encourage females to work for Rentokil 

Initial

•  Building female representation in our frontline operations roles that will create the 

pipeline of women for middle and senior manager roles

•  Monitoring  and reporting on a monthly  basis the diversity split throughout the 

organisation

Rentokil Initial has several employing entities within the group. Under the gender pay 
reporting regulations there is a requirement that we publish the gender pay statistics for 
those companies that have more than 250 employees and these are set out over the 
following pages.

Peter Cox was acquired by Rentokil Initial in 2015. Females are generally employed in 
more junior administrative roles. Surveyors, technicians and managers are usually male, 
as is typical within the building industry. 

We are developing our employer value proposition to encourage more females to work 
for the business.

The senior roles within this company are predominately Finance and IT roles and have 
tended to attract more males due to the nature of the business and the function, which 
is why we have a relatively higher pay and bonus gap between men and women in this 
company, than in other parts of our business.

We are building our employer value proposition to encourage more females to work for 
Rentokil Initial and are looking to develop our key female talent across all functional disciplines.
