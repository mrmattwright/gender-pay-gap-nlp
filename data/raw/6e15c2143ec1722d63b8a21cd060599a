Because different jobs pay differently and the number of men and women performing these jobs varies, a 
gender pay gap exists.  The mean gender pay gap shows the difference in the average hourly rate of pay 
between men and women across all jobs in HHA.  This is different from ‘equal pay’, which is the difference in 
pay between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs.
