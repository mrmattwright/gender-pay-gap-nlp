Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
 
The North Essex Multi-Academy Trust as an employer is required by law to carry out Gender Pay 
Gap Reporting in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017. 
 
The overall gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the mean (average) or median 
(actual midpoint) hourly rate of pay of male and female employees. 
 
The results of these statutory calculations across all staff across all three schools in the Trust, 
based on pay data at 31 March 2017, are as follows: 
 
Mean and Median Pay 

Mean Pay Gap 
Median Pay Gap 

20.25% 
34.51% 

 
According to the Office of National Statistics, the overall UK mean gender pay gap is currently 
18.1% which means that the North Essex Multi-Academy Trust’s mean pay gap across all staff is 
higher than the national average.   
 
According to the Chartered Management Institute 2016 Gender Pay Survey, the overall UK 
median gender pay gap is 23%, which means that the North Essex Multi-Academy Trust’s 
median pay gap across all staff is higher than the national average. 
 
The above figures indicate that across teaching and associate staff, on average female 
employees receive lower pay than male employees.

Women 
81.82%

78.00% 
67.33% 

 
The above figures indicate that the North Essex Multi-Academy Trust has a much higher 
proportion of women in all quartiles but especially in the lower, lower middle and upper middle 
quartiles. 
 
No bonuses were paid to staff for the reporting period. 
 
The Trust uses pay scales for all teachers that are aligned to the School Teachers’ Pay and 
Conditions document, which is reviewed on an annual basis.  Staff move through the pay scales 
in line with performance related criteria. 
 
For associate staff the Trust uses pay scales set by the National Joint Council for Government 
Services.  Staff move through the pay scales for their grade until they reach the top of their 
contractual pay range. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Breakdown of gender pay gap across North Essex Multi-Academy Trust 
 
Because of the disparate range of salaries across the spectrum of associate staff and teaching 
staff, the Trust has further analysed the figures for teachers and associate staff as follows: 
 
Teaching Staff 
Mean Pay Gap 
Median Pay Gap 

9.59% 
4.96%

Women 
79.66% 
82.46% 
82.46% 
81.03% 

6.28% 
0.00% 

 
Separate analysis of teaching and associate staff pay demonstrates mean gender pay gaps of 
9.59% and 6.28% respectively which are significantly below the UK average of 18.1%. 
 
Similarly median gender pay gaps are 4.96% and 0.00% respectively which are significantly 
below the UK average of 23%. 
 
Separate analysis of teaching and associate staff obviously still indicates that the Trust has a 
much higher proportion of women in all quartiles but the spread across all four quartiles is more 
even. 
 
Supporting Statement 
 
The North Essex Multi-Academy Trust operates as an equal opportunities employer and does not 
discriminate in any way (as defined by the Equalities Act 2010 and other relevant legislation), 
regarding recruitment, performance management and employee career development 
opportunities.   
 
The majority of staff roles in the Trust are part-time, either aligning closely to the hours of 
attendance of pupils or for part of that time.   This includes the number of hours worked per week 
and also the number of weeks worked per year.  Whilst this impacts on average salaries, the 
family friendly employment opportunities offered by the Trust influence the decision of applicants 
and the continuation of employment of our (predominantly female) staff.  The overall gender pay 
gap therefore reflects workforce composition and personal working pattern choices rather than 
gender pay inequality. 
 
The Trustees have reviewed this data and will consider the progress made on reducing the 
gender pay gap regularly.
