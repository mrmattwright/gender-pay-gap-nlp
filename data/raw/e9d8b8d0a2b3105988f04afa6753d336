The agency staff are overall warm, friendly & reliable and genuinely want to be working in the nursery.  Constructive criticism is listened too and Sian is very proactive with addressing any issues with her staff team and this is reflected in their performance on return to the nursery. Sian works tirelessly to cover our needs with effective communication keeping us up to date.

We are very grateful for their help, efficiency and professionalism.  Emma at Julia Durbin Nursery – Childbase Group     Wizard are always able to help us with staff when we need them. Helen is helpful and always informs us of any changes such as staff sickness etc. She tries her best to replace them but even if she fails to do so she will keep us updated.
