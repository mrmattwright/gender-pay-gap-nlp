Gender pay gap report

GENDER PAY GAP

Hazlewoods is an equal opportunities employer, we are committed to achieving an inclusive working 
environment that encourages all of our employees to develop to their full potential regardless of gender, 
race, religion or disability.

Under new legislation that came into force in April 2017, UK employers with more than 250 employees 
are required to publish their gender pay gap.

The gender pay gap is an equality measure that shows the difference in average earnings between 
women and men.  It should not be confused with equal pay, which refers to being paid the same amount 
for the same or similar work.

If we were reporting on equal pay, for the same or similar work, then there would be no gap 
between women and men, as it is our clear policy to reward without any form of differentiation. 

OUR GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

The tables below show our overall mean and median pay and bonus gap at the first snapshot date of 5th 
April 2017

Our mean gender pay gap of 8.2% represents the difference in men and women's average earnings, 
regardless of their role or seniority.  By way of comparison to the previous year our mean pay gap was 
14.6% and the median 11.4%.

UNDERSTANDING OUR GENDER PAY GAP

The analysis of our gender pay gap figures tells us that our total workforce is 60% female, and that at 
every quartile we employ more women than men. Women make up the majority of our support and 
administrative staff, which mostly fall into the lower middle quartile. The mean gender pay gap amongst 
our client facing staff is 2.7% (median -3.4%). Our detailed analysis shows that the pay gap is negligible, 
or even negative, in all but the upper quartile where, like many UK businesses, there are fewer women 
in senior leadership positions. Although women make up 60% of the upper quartile, this segment 
includes staff from Associate Manager through to Director, with more women currently concentrated at 
the lower end of this scale as shown by the table below.

We do not operate a bonus culture at Hazlewoods, and less than 1% of the workforce are part of a 
bonus scheme. In the year to 5 April 2017, one male and one female employee received bonuses. Due 
to the two very different bonus scheme structures, the resulting figure of 87.5% is completely 
unrepresentative of our overall approach to remuneration.
