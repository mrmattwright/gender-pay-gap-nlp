requiring companies with over 250 employees to annually disclose their gender pay gap. 
Trelleborg Sealing Solutions UK Limited had a workforce exceeding this limit in April 2017 and 
consequently is required to share the context of the results and our approach to closing the 
underlying gap.

Analysis  

Trelleborg Sealing Solutions UK Limited is committed to the principles of equal pay for all of our 
employees. Our current gender pay gap as at April 2017 was 26% (UK average 18.4% in 2017 
Office for National Statistics). However, the analysis of our gender gap figures tells us that this 
arises because women hold fewer positions within the upper quartile of the Company. The 
mean bonus pay gap is also heavily skewed and driven by males occupying more senior 
positions.   

Trelleborg actively works to achieve a balanced mix of genders, ethnicities and ages in its 
operations.  We have an open policy to recruitment both internally and externally from people of 
all genders. We recruit and promote based on skills and experience. We do find that 
significantly more male colleagues apply for positions in the Upper Quartile. There are 
longstanding societal patterns and perceptions that have led to certain occupations (e.g. 
engineering) and certain sectors (e.g. manufacturing) being heavily dominated by one gender 
and we are actively working to increase the number of females at all levels in our Company, 
particularly at senior management leadership level.
