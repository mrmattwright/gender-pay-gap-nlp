Gender Pay Gap - Reporting 
 
Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish 
statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female 
employees. 
 
Thanet District Council has published its  gender pay gap on GOV.UK .

Council does not have bonus payments)
