Greenways  New residents and garden!     Honeysuckle Farm  Honeysuckle Farm Have been awarded 3 certificates at a ceremony at the Chambers of Leicestershire County Council offices, we are the first Community Opportunities service to receive this award in Leicestershire. We Have a Dignity award for the home and one for C/O service. Our third award is a certificate of Commendation given to us for demonstrating a commitment to developing exceptional person-centred plans and Health action plans for our service users. This apparently is a rare thing and not issued lightly, there were only us and one other home to receive it out of 70 homes. Photos etc will be in the Leicester Mercury and also in our local papers. And on top of that we are having Radio Leicester coming to Honeysuckle to interview us, great hey!!!!!!!  Southleigh  We have another recommendation on Care Home UK !!! All residents are happy at Southleigh with the majority enjoying their annual holidays in June. Several clients went to a hotel in Weston Super Mare enjoyed dancing and bingo but were also able to enjoy day trips to Chedder Gorge and Bath to take in the historical sites. They enjoyed the weather and were lucky to have seen the sun for their visit (we had rain). A second and third holiday group enjoyed the delights of Blackpool; we tried a new hotel which they all said provided “great grub”. This hotel was situated at the heart of Blackpool rather than the outskirts and so all clients were able to access the Zoo, sea life, shops and entertainment close at hand. Residents are happy with the current refurbishment on-going in the main areas of the home – one family member asked if we had won the pools and going up market, as if!! We have also been on days out sampling the delights of Skegness and Twycross Zoo , disco nights with the Lions and live music from Barry in the home to help us celebrate BIG BIRTHDAYS.  Fairhaven  Some pictures when we had a very nice day, some of Fairhaven Service users visited Abbington Park and walked around the bird area and finished off have coffee and cake in the cafe. All Service users enjoyed and another trip planned in the near future if the weather holds out.  The baby chick was born on the 8th of May to the delight of all the service users and has been named after a former resident of Fairhaven who will be greatly missed. It will remain at Fairhaven for a few weeks and then re-homed with the managers.      Southleigh  We have been in the party mood at Southleigh we have had a couple of BIG BIRTHDAY EVENTS. All residents enjoyed getting down and grooving with Barry. He always gives them a good time. Now that the better weather is here at last we are able to access the town more frequently ( and the extra staff is a bonus). They also enjoy the involvement of local students from the college to paint etc. We have had in house movie days – including the popcorn !!!  Thurston House  One of our client currently plays for MK dons football in the learning disability group. Also in March one of our clients was given complimentary tickets to watch Crawley town FC play against MK dons .Our clients also attend the learning disability disco called the ghetto club. This takes place every 2 weeks in Milton Keynes city centre.  The Highlands  We had a ‘Saint Patrick’s Day’ whereby the unit was decorated and we had a lovely buffet with some Irish recipes e.g. Kerry Apple Cake, Bailey’s Cheesecake etc. We had a quiz which everyone enjoyed and they enjoyed the day – unfortunately we didn’t have any photos taken. Some of the residents are going on holiday in June to Haggerston Castle Holiday Park and are really looking forward to it  Stanway – In bloom!  Staff & clients have been working to create a beautiful patio area for all to enjoy. We have created a memory garden in the back garden, this was created for Sylvia, as she wanted a peaceful area to sit in and to remember her parents – who passed away a few years ago. Sylvia helped choose the flowers, and the main pink rose is called – Mum in a Million. The other clients benefit from the bench, as they enjoy sitting out there either to enjoy a cup of coffee or to read a book or complete puzzle books. For our visual impaired clients, we have created a sensory herb garden – containing various textured and scented herbs. For the more able bodied clients, they have grown tomato plants from seed, and as from the photos, you can see that they have developed well, and are about to produce a fine yield of tomatoes, which we will be able to offer to our friendly neighbours. In the patio, we have 2 raised flower beds, which enable our wheelchair users to assist in our gardening projects and with the beautiful hanging baskets – this provides a relaxing area for the clients to eat their lunch or evening meal, or to enjoying a peaceful environment with their family and friends.         Avenue Road  Meal out with service users at Wetherspoon in Wolverhampton, and one helping to prepare lunch       The Grove  One of our young person’s has just passed an interview with a company, and will do a ten week course on employability and personal development, customer services and sector based training. This is a massive achievement for him as when he came to us he was not attending school. After completing this course he would have the opportunity to do an apprenticeship and learn a trade or possibly even get a job out of it. This young lad has completely turned his life around and has turned into a lovely thoughtful young man. I feel that he should be highly commended for this, well done on this massive achievement.  2012  Wallace Mews  From the local paper   Greenways  Some pictures from our residents recent holidays 14-18 July on a boat cruise from Great Bedwin Wiltshire     Ashleigh House  Olympic torch relay went past Ashleigh House           Queen’s  60 Jubilee  Celebrated  by all!

Southleigh  Jane and Brenda had a” ball” at the community dancing Jubilee dance. Both residents enjoyed dressing up for the occasion with red, white and blue flowers in their hair. All had a great time. Jane has celebrated her birthday (1/6/12). She enjoyed visits from her family and going out shopping for the day with staff. She also enjoyed her party with her friends in the evening.      Fairhaven  Fairhaven celebrates the queen jubilee in style at the penny lane pub followed by a general knowledge quiz with prizes for 1st and 2nd. Clients had the opportunity to watch old film on DVD from the 50 upwards all enjoyed and brought memories flooding back. All enjoyed the buffet lunch provided by staff.     New Ridley  New Ridley celebrated the Queens Jubilee with a BBQ wearing their England hats and waving their flags to the music on the TV. Great fun was had by all.  Mountview  Mountview had a huge indoor party with the whole of indoors and out decorated for the occasion. One client also celebrated her 60th Birthday.  Parkdale  Parkdale celebrated the Diamond Jubilee with 3 parties over Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. This included a Hog roast on the Sunday and events such as face painting, games. Old time music and buffets on the Monday and Tuesday with the service users toasting the Queen. The home was decorated with bunting and union jack flags as well as decorations made by the service users.  Newlands  Newlands had a Jubilee BBQ and Cream Tea with homemade scones and cakes that the Service Users baked. The party moved indoors as the weather was not in their favour. 4 Service Users at Newlands are actively taking part in Gateway Awards doing activities, meeting new people and doing volunteering in the local community. 2 Service Users at Newlands at taking part in a performance at the local college with their Drama Group. 2 Service Users took part in an Animation Course and made a short film using plasticine models that they made.  The Highlands  We had a lovely jubilee party on 5th June to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee – the unit has been decorated to reflect the celebrations We had quizzes, played hangman and had traditional games like ‘shove halfpenny’ which everyone really enjoyed.  We had a traditional English tea and had cup cakes decorated in the Union Jack colours. Everyone received a gift on the day of a Commemorative Celebration mug and a keying or similar. We have all enjoyed watching the celebrations on TV with pride!     News from one of our homes: We have one young person who has recently started to work in a charity day centre 3 days per week, massive achievement! Also another big step for one of our young people going back to school and he loves it!  Avenue Road  Busy service users and staff happily mowing, laundry, snacking and enjoying the beautiful weather. WELL DONE!       The Highlands  Nicola had been in a road traffic accident aged 15 years and spent 5 months in a coma. She always said Boy George’s music brought her out of her coma. Nicola spends regular respite stays with us at The Highlands and we realised that Boy George was having a concert while she was here – so we arranged for her to go. We then asked Boy George to meet her and he agreed. Nicola spent quite a while with the group after the concert and they were absolutely lovely with her. They all stayed in stage costume until they met her. George’s brother pushed her wheelchair and they all chatted and had photos taken. Nicola was delighted and has her photos to help her remember her wonderful experience – courtesy of The Highlands!    The Highlands – Email to the director regarding the staff: I am just mentioning how brilliant the staff has been at The Highlands during 11 days of horrendous conditions. We have had about 13-15 inches of snow here and the roads have been treacherous now for over a week. Some staff have walked in through about 5 miles in the snow. The staff that live locally have covered loads of shifts for those who were snowed in at home. Also staff have had some staff sleeping at their houses (who live here) to save them risking the journey home, and to help them get to work the next day. All this to ensure our guests have had the correct care – they have been exceptional!! I think they are commendable. Regards A  Thurston House  Matthew (Golden Balls) Matt plays for the MK Dons Learning Disability Team, he was chosen to attend trials in Bolton in January this year. After scoring an impressive Hat Trick he has been chosen to represent Great Britain in the Special Olympics 2011 to be held in the world Games Athens. Matt will be travelling to Athens and spending 3 weeks there playing for Great Britain. Matthew is very excited as football is his passion and this will be his first time travelling abroad, the next few months will be a busy time for Matt, the team and staff. Staff in partnership with MK Dons will support Matt with every aspect of the trip from understanding the Special Olympics code of conduct to the extra training he will need to ensure he is at his best Matthew said it is wicked and his going out there to bring the cup home for MK Dons and Thurston House Well done Matt!  The Highlands  ‘The Circus Comes to Town’ we’ve had our residents to a circus over the last few days.

Thanks everyone  Southleigh  BP – has enjoyed her Mum and Dad’s Golden Wedding party this week. B visited her family home for the first time in 3 years. JP is looking forward to going to Wales next week. He remembers fondly time he spent on his uncle’s farm as a young boy. Let’s hope the weather improves.  Fairhaven  Zoological afternoon was fab all service users took part and enjoyed the bug snakes and rats. Comments from service users were Claire from Zoological passed on some interesting and informative information and were looking forward to the next visit. Some of the animals looked horrid but we had the chance to touch and hold. One service user said he took them back to their child hood when they use to play with creepy crawlies.     A singing and dancing afternoon to the songs from stage and screen. Service users shouting and singing along to the music of Rogers and Hammerstein The King and I, South Pacific and Oklahoma.

Avenue Road  Busy service users and staff happily mowing, laundry, snacking and enjoying the beautiful weather. WELL DONE!       The Highlands  Nicola had been in a road traffic accident aged 15 years and spent 5 months in a coma. She always said Boy George’s music brought her out of her coma. Nicola spends regular respite stays with us at The Highlands and we realised that Boy George was having a concert while she was here – so we arranged for her to go. We then asked Boy George to meet her and he agreed. Nicola spent quite a while with the group after the concert and they were absolutely lovely with her. They all stayed in stage costume until they met her. George’s brother pushed her wheelchair and they all chatted and had photos taken. Nicola was delighted and has her photos to help her remember her wonderful experience – courtesy of The Highlands!    The Highlands – Email to the director regarding the staff: I am just mentioning how brilliant the staff has been at The Highlands during 11 days of horrendous conditions. We have had about 13-15 inches of snow here and the roads have been treacherous now for over a week. Some staff have walked in through about 5 miles in the snow. The staff that live locally have covered loads of shifts for those who were snowed in at home. Also staff have had some staff sleeping at their houses (who live here) to save them risking the journey home, and to help them get to work the next day. All this to ensure our guests have had the correct care – they have been exceptional!! I think they are commendable. Regards A  Thurston House  Matthew (Golden Balls) Matt plays for the MK Dons Learning Disability Team, he was chosen to attend trials in Bolton in January this year.
