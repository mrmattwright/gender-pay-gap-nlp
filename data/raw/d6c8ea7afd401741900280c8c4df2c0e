The challenge for Hertsmere Leisure as an organisation, is to attempt to eliminate any gaps in gender pay as far as 
possible. However this challenge is difficult due to the part time nature of our industry which tends to attracts females 
to many of the roles within the business. Hertsmere Leisure will continue to monitor these figures on an annual basis 
and are determined  to ensure  that wherever  possible  we have  a balanced workforce  in terms of age,  gender and 
ethnicity, in order to represent the communities that we serve.
