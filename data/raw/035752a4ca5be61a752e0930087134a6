•  In addition, significantly more 

of our female staff work on  
a part-time basis than our 
male staff which has had some 
impact on our bonus gaps 
because we have to report on 
bonus figures based on actual 
amounts paid and not on  
a full-time equivalent basis.

•  This exercise has provided us 
with renewed focus and some 
new ideas to add to our already 
strong commitment to gender 
diversity. In particular, we 
are redoubling our efforts to 
improve our gender balance in 
the most senior positions within 
each quartile.

Understanding  
our gender pay  
and bonus gaps

We are confident 
that we pay men 
and women fairly 
for equivalent 
roles, and are 
pleased that the 
gender pay gap for 
each of our four 
pay quartiles is 
smaller than our 
overall average.  

•  In 9 out of our 12 quartiles  
the gender pay gap is small  
or even negative, and while we 
still have some way to go to 
close the gap, especially in the 
fourth (highest) quartiles, we 
are encouraged by the ongoing 
concerted efforts to attract and 
retain females in current and 
new senior positions across  
the business.

•  The most significant gender 

imbalances are caused by 
the fact that, like many 
law firms, the roles that sit 
within the lower quartiles are 
predominantly secretarial 
and junior business services 
positions, and the majority of 
these roles are held by women. 

•  This structural factor also 
affects our bonus pay gap.  
While we are pleased that 
women are as likely (in fact, 
slightly more likely) to receive 
a bonus as men, as a firm 
the roles that are eligible for 
bonuses tend to be in the higher 
pay quartiles, where we have a 
higher proportion of men. This, 
together with the fact that a 
number of our most senior roles 
(and those that are likely to pay 
proportionately higher bonuses) 
are held by men widens the 
bonus pay gaps further.

Closing the 
gender pay gap 
at Clyde & Co 

We recognise 
that we have 
more work to do 
to achieve greater 
gender balance at 
senior levels in the 
firm. Achieving 
our goals in this 
area will take 
sustained focus 
and time. Some 
of the actions 
we’ve already 
taken include:  

•  We appointed our first Global 

•  We are committed to providing 

•  We recognise that career paths 

Head of Diversity and Inclusion 
in 2017 to develop and oversee 
the implementation of our 
diversity strategy and support 
our efforts to address our 
gender pay and bonus gaps 
ensuring that diversity and 
inclusion are embedded 
across the organisation and 
its business processes.

•  As part of a wider review, 

we are currently considering 
further diversity and inclusion 
initiatives for partner and 
management positions.

•  In recent years we have been 

applying a more rigorous 
approach to the gender mix of 
candidates at all levels during 
our recruitment processes,  
promotion to partnership and 
to senior leadership positions. 
While there is still a long way 
to go, we are pleased to have 
achieved greater diversity at 
the global and regional board 
levels and among our senior 
management team.    

fair and competitive rewards 
to all our people, irrespective 
of gender and actively review 
our talent identification, annual 
performance, pay, and bonus 
activities to ensure fairness in 
the process and in outcomes.

for men and women are not 
always linear or uniform. With 
this in mind we are looking into 
a more consistent approach to 
maternity coaching and a back 
up care provision programme, 
among other measures.

•  We are working hard to 

ensure that all high potential 
employees have equal access 
to our successful Senior 
Leadership Programme 
designed to help fee earners 
reach the partnership – since 
the programme started in 
the UK in 2016 nearly half of 
participants have been women. 

•  We recognise the value of 

mentoring in driving diversity 
and career progression and 
are committed to making 
better use of it throughout our 
organisation. We currently have 
a series of informal mentoring 
and coaching programmes 
across the organisation, 
including membership of the 
30% Club’s cross organisational 
mentoring scheme, which we 
are looking to formalise and 
expand. This will ensure that 
we better meet the different 
needs of employees of all 
backgrounds and levels across 
the firm.  

We conﬁ rm that the data reported 
is accurate
