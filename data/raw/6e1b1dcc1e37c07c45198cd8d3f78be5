Its aim is to achieve greater transparency about gender pay difference. The analysis is based on data as at 5 April of each year. The gender pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women. This is different to equal pay. Equal pay requires that men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs - or work of equal value - are paid the same. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.          What We Publish Companies with 250 or more employees are required publish and report information on the following calculations:    The mean gender pay gap    The median gender pay gap    The mean gender bonus gap    The median gender bonus gap    Men & women receiving bonuses    Salary quartiles     OUR STATEMENT DETAILING OUR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE GENDER PAY DOWNLOAD NOW       THE CALCULATIONS IN OUR REPORT MAKE USE OF TWO TYPES OF AVERAGES:    A MEAN AVERAGE Involves adding up all of the numbers and dividing the result by how many numbers were in the list.    A MEDIAN AVERAGE Involves listing all of the numbers in numerical order. If there is an odd number of results, the median average is the middle number.    Using these two different types of average is helpful to give a more balanced overview of an employer’s overall gender pay gap.
