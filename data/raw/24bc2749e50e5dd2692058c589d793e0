This requires us to carry out six calculations and publish the results each year, showing the size of the pay gap between our male and female employees.  We have calculated the relevant figures for Field Sales Solutions Limited, set out below, using the mechanisms that are set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation.  I can confirm that these figures have been verified and checked to ensure their accuracy.
