Originally based in the UK, JZ Flowers is a vibrant and growing organisation with established operations now in Holland, Ireland, Miami and Turkey where we carefully select and pack over 450 million stems per year.  JZ Flowers is the largest importer of Fairtrade Flowers in the UK and over the last 5 years we have sourced over 160 million Fairtrade stems resulting in over £1.3 million of Fairtrade premiums being paid back to workers across Kenya, Ethiopia, Sri-Lanka and Tanzania.  We also focus heavily on British Grown Flowers and we have a JZ office based in Spalding, the heartland of the Lincolnshire growing community to continue to build the excellent relationships we hold with our local growers.  At heart, we’re florists and what we do is floristry. Our business has been founded on a commitment to design, innovation and quality, but we have developed and grown to become a market leader and champion sustainable, ethically sourced flowers on an industrial, global scale.  Our business is built on trust, reliability, knowledge and that personal JZ touch!  JZ Flowers is pick of the bunch!
