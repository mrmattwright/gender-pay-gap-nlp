Therefore this shouldn’t be confused with equal pay.  We will use the results to address any inequalities.  Due to Canute’s business of haulage and transportation the majority of employees in the reporting company are male drivers. This is not due to a lack of effort to recruit female drivers where possible.  The breakdown of our 663 employees:   Male drivers and warehouse staff – 634  Male admin staff – 14  Female drivers and warehouse staff – 8  Female admin staff – 7   Pay gap calculation  Pay gap summary for mean and median  We understand the importance of our clients to the future success of the Canute Group. It’s important for us to demonstrate integrity to our clients and be professional and respectful at all times.   Overall there is a mean pay difference of 1.6% with female employees having an hourly pay rate of £10.47 and male £10.64. Median pay difference is 2.8% with female on £10.43 per hour and male £10.73.  While these pay figures differences are generally low we will bear them in mind when recruiting going forward.   Pay gap summary for salary quartile bands   There is a consistent representation of females in each quartile of pay. Although as discussed above this only ranges from 1% – 4% due to the nature of the business.   Pay gap summary for bonus payments   Bonuses are performance and attendance related and generally paid to drivers not admin staff.  The mean pay gap is 0.32% and median 0.28%.  There is a discrepancy with only 48% of females receiving a bonus compared to 82% of males but this is due to job roles.   Conclusion and recommendations  The figures highlight the need to be aware of the gender pay gap when recruiting and also when calculating pay reviews for current staff. Canute Distribution is keen to eliminate as much of the difference as possible, especially in an industry that leans towards male employees.
