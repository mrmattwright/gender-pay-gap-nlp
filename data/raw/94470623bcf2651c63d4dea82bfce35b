Gender pay gap      As of April 2018, all organisations that employ 250 people or more are required to report on their gender pay gap.  Who makes up Marie Curie’s workforce?   The vast majority of our employees (87.6%) are women.  We employ at least 80% women at every level of seniority within the charity.  Five of our seven executive directors are women, including our Chief Executive, Dr Jane Collins .   What is the gender pay gap?  The gender pay gap is the difference in the average salaries earned by men and women in an organisation. It does not compare salaries earned by men and women in similar roles.  What is Marie Curie’s gender pay gap?  Our mean gender pay gap is 12.4%.  Our median gender pay gap is 7.2%.  Both of these figures are significantly below the UK average and the average for organisations of a similar size.  Why does Marie Curie have a gender pay gap?  Although we have relatively few male employees at any level of the organisation, more of those men are in higher-paid roles than lower-paid.  For example, we have particular challenges around recruiting more men into front-line care roles, where they are under-represented in the sector as a whole.  You can see this in the table below, which shows the breakdown of male and female employees from the lowest paid quarter of staff (A) to the highest paid quarter (D).     Band  Males  Females    A  114 (11.6%)  870 (88.4%)    B  91 (9.2%)  893 (90.8%)    C  121 (12.3%)  863 (87.7%)    D  162 (16.4%)  823 (83.6%)    Total  488 (12.4%)  3,449 (87.6%)     What is Marie Curie’s gender bonus gap?  All organisations with more than 250 employees are also required to report on the gender gap in bonuses paid.  Marie Curie does not pay bonuses to any staff in the traditional sense.  We do, however, have a Chief Executive’s Award scheme, which recognises individual achievements from time to time with a one-off award of £250.  In 2017/18, 0.6% of male staff and 0.6% of female staff received one of these awards.  As these awards are a fixed amount, Marie Curie’s gender bonus gap is zero.  What will Marie Curie be doing to address the gap?  We will now consider what steps we might be able to take to increase recruitment of men into front-line care roles where they are currently poorly represented.
