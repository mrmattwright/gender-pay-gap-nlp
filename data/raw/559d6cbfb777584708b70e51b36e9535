GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

RIDGE AND PARTNERS LLP 
Gender Pay Gap Report 2017
Annual Gender Pay Gap reporting became a legislative requirement for all companies with 250 or more 
employees in April 2017.  Ridge and Partners LLP believes that it is an all-inclusive and diverse organisation 
where anyone can reach their full potential, we are keen to support this Government initiative and 
committed to carrying out the actions identified in this report.

The above table shows our mean and median hourly gender pay gap at the snapshot date 5 April 2017.   
Bonus data is based on bonus eligible and bonus earned during the period Jan-Dec 2016 and paid in 2017.

Our analysis of the gender pay gap shows that as a company we employ more men than women overall and 
that we have more men than women in our top quartile pay band while at the same time men are under-
represented in our lower quartile pay band.  

This is largely explained by the fact that we are a technical services company supporting the construction 
industry.  Historically more men than women have chosen to enter these professions and whilst this has 
changed over recent years, it has yet to have a significant effect at the senior levels throughout the industry 
sector.  As can be seen from the graphs above, most of the women employed at Ridge are working in 
administrative/support roles, which are lower paid and generally require fewer qualifications.   

At Ridge & Partners we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across 
our business, and this is confirmed by the data in the graphs above, and in the data provided below.    
We continue to act to address any gaps and to make sure our policies and practices are fair.  This includes 
actively reviewing decisions around recruitment, assessment, training and development, pay and bonus.

Eligibility for inclusion in a bonus scheme is restricted to relatively senior roles, and achievement of a bonus 
payment is based on various business and personal performance metrics.  As more men than women are 
employed in our senior roles, more men than women are eligible for a bonus and this explains the gender 
gap regarding bonus. 

100% of women eligible to participate in the bonus scheme received a bonus, compared to 70% of men 
receiving a bonus. We are confident that men and women in the scheme have an equal opportunity to earn a 
bonus.
