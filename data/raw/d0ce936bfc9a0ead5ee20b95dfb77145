A history of high jinks  Hello everyone, and welcome to Wicksteed Park! I’m Charles Wicksteed, the fellow who created this park back in 1913. I wanted it to be a place where children and adults alike could get out and have a bit of fun, whether they fancied zooming down a waterchute, or taking a gentle stroll.  A century later, I reckon we’re still Britain’s best day out. There’s lots more to discover about our story.  Wicksteed’s History                   is for Wicksteed Charitable Trust  The Wicksteed Charitable Trust, which recently celebrated its centenary, has kept alive Charles Wicksteed’s dream of providing healthy play for children and families.  The Trust strives to bring the history of the park alive to all visitors and reflect its rich heritage but it is also looking forward to ensure a vision for the future that is both innovative and ambitious.  More about the Trust            Memberships and Accredditations                    Wicksteed Park is a member of BALPPA (British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions) and welcomes visits by people with disabilities to its amusement park.
