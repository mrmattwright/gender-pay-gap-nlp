As a publicly-listed company, the Group's Board of Directors follows corporate governance standards that promote integrity, transparency, and accountability in order to protect and enhance Intertek’s value to stakeholders and the long-term success of the company. We guide many of the world's largest multinational corporations and best-known brands to improve the social, ethical and environmental consequences of their products, services and supply chains. We have adopted a framework approach to our own corporate responsibility. We believe that local managers are best placed to understand and react to their local business environment, within this framework. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Report contained in our Annual Report shows how these policies are being implemented around the Group. Our integrity is crucial to our business. Intertek is committed to high standards of professional conduct, and to ethical and fair business dealings with our employees, stakeholders, and third parties.
