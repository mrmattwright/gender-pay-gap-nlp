MINDING THE GAP 

THE OPEN UNIVERSITY GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

Summary

The Open University believes that, although our mean 
gender pay gap is lower than that of the higher education 
sector and the median is on a par with it, any gender pay 
gap is unwelcome. The University is committed to making 
every attempt to reduce the gender pay gap. Women make 
up 60% of the total OU population. We have substantially 
more women than men in lower paid roles, which is a key 
contributor to the pay gap.

* The Open University has excluded Consultants as the data required to calculate 
the gender pay gap isn’t available – this is in line with the regulations. However, the 
OU will be looking at how this data can be captured.
** Data taken at the snapshot date ie 31 March 2017 (pay) and in the 12 months 
reference period to 31 March 2017 (bonus). 

Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile 
What does this mean?
The data shows there is a greater proportion of women across all pay quartiles. However, more than 60% of the 
population are women in the lower and lower mid quartiles (1 and 2) and this will be contributing to the overall 
median pay gap figure between men and women of 14.9%.

Employee Groups
When we look at our main employee groups, there 
is no pay gap at a median level between female 
and male Associate Lecturers. The pay gap for our 
academic and non-academic staff is lower than at  
the overall OU level.

Why the gender pay gap and 
equal pay are not the same
Analysing and reviewing a gender pay gap is not the 
same as doing an equal pay review.

Bonus gender pay gap
The median bonus pay gap is 17.9%. This is a result 
of the different types of bonus being paid and a larger 
proportion of women receiving our ‘going the extra mile 
awards’*, which are used to recognise specific actions 
that go beyond normal day-to-day expectations.

How is the OU addressing the gender pay gap? 

  By continuing with our strong 
commitment to Equality and Inclusion

 

Inclusion is one of our institutional values to 
ensure it is at the forefront of all that we do

  Our highly commended Equality Scheme  

2016–2020 sets out our commitment to developing 
an inclusive University community where people 
are treated with dignity and respect

  The OU is a member of the United Nation’s 

HeForShe campaign

  The OU is a member of the 30% Club – with a 

focus on gender balance on management boards. 
Representation on our VCE exceeds this target  
by 6% 

  Our ambitions are to:

  increase the proportion of women in senior 

professional and academic roles in the  
medium term

  increase the leadership potential of women by 

at least 25% of Aurora* participants having a 
career move within two years of completing the 
development programme

* AURORA is the Leadership Foundation’s women-only leadership 
development programme

 To help drive these ambitions

  The OU’s Gender Equality Steering Group provides 
leadership for gender equality across the University 
– we continue to build on the work of the Athena 
SWAN** action plan

  Aurora: a women-only leadership programme is 

now running in its fifth year and is aimed at giving 
women more confidence to work at senior levels in 
the organisation

  The Vice-Chancellor’s Executive Team (VCE) 
has completed unconscious bias training. An 
unconscious bias online training module is now 
available to all staff

  Associate Lecturer mentoring scheme is available 

to all new Associate Lecturers

** Athena SWAN is a scheme that recognises and celebrates good employment 
practice for women working in STEM in higher education and research

 Our approach to Reward

Our approach to Reward is underpinned by nationally 
agreed pay scales and an annual pay review process 
which supports an unbiased approach. We continue 
to look at our Reward framework with the intention of 
improving transparency and reducing any gender bias 
gaps in our pay.
