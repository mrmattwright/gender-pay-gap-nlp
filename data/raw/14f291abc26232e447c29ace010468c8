At  Alpha  Flight  we  recognise  that  a  diverse  workforce  enables  us  to  provide  a  richer  and  more  engaging 
 
environment for colleagues and delivers huge benefits to the business. Our analysis has demonstrated a mean gap 
 
of 12.6% which is below the national average of 17.5% (XpertHR). The jobs that fall within the 1st pay quartile are 
 
 
primarily  working  in  the  Flight  Packing,  Operations  areas  and  Kitchens  in  the  Production  facility  and  whilst  the 
 
Company  advertises  these  roles  without  a  gender  bias  the  majority  of  candidates  are  female  and  therefore  the 
 
pool from which selection is made is predominately female.  Where males do apply and are successful, they are 
 
paid exactly the same rate as females.  The difference in pay is mainly due to the bulk of upper middle rate roles –  
 
drivers  and  chefs,  being  predominantly  filled  by  men  so  we  are  actively    encouraging  more 
 
 
women 
into  these  professions  through  recruitment  practices  and  our  apprenticeship 
 
programme.    The  Company  is  also  looking  to  encourage  more  internal  promotion  to  shift 
 
manager  roles  through  succession  planning  and  training. We  are  confident  that  we  meet  our 
 
equal pay obligations across the business and we continue to operate robust controls for new 
 
positions  to  ensure  fair  pay  and  to  attract,  retain  and  develop  a  diverse  and  talented 
 
population.
