March 2018  Background From April 2017, Employers with 250 or more employees are required to publish information each year to show the difference in average pay between male and female employees.  All of the information in this report is based on salary data at a ‘snapshot’ date of 31st March 2017.  The gender pay gap report must set out the Councils results in relation to 6 calculations:  Mean Gender Pay Gap   The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full pay relevant employees and that of female full pay relevant employees   Median Gender Pay Gap   The difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full pay relevant employees and that of female full pay relevant employees   Mean Bonus Gap   The difference between the mean bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female relevant employees   Median Bonus Gap   The difference between the median bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female relevant employees   Bonus proportions   The proportions of male and female relevant employees who were paid bonus during the relevant period   Quartile Pay   The proportions of male and female full pay relevant employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands   The council must publish its result both on its own website and the government gender pay gap service website all results for the snapshot date of 31st March 2017 can be found on the link below:  https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/Viewing/search-results?p=1&search=&y=2017  The data analysed relates to all employees of Tamworth Borough Council employed in temporary or permanent contracts on the reporting snapshot date (known as relevant employees).  It includes those under an apprenticeship or contract to provide a service which falls under the IR35 regulations. Pay is based on ordinary pay which includes basic pay (hourly rate), contractual enhancements (such as stand by or essential car user) and sick pay.  Pay excludes expenses, overtime pay, pay in lieu of leave, benefits in kind and redundancy pay.    Gender Pay Gap Outcomes The results of the 6 required calculations are outlined below, based on data for the snapshot date of 31st March 2017.  Gender  Full-pay relevant employee count  Female  214  Male  132  Total  346    Mean Gender Pay Gap The mean (average) gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly pay rate of relevant male employees and that of relevant female employees as a percentage of men’s earnings.  Gender  Mean hourly rate  Female  13.11  Male  14.79  Total  13.75  Therefore in TBC the hourly rate for women is 11.37% lower than for men.    Median Gender Pay Gap The median (middle value) gender pay gap is the difference between the median hourly pay rate of relevant male employees and that of relevant female employees as a percentage of men’s earnings.  Gender  Median hourly rate  Female  12.18  Male  12.97  Total  12.8  Therefore in TBC the hourly rate for women is 6.05% lower than for men.    Bonus Pay Gap Tamworth Borough Council do not pay bonus payments to employees in line with the criteria within the scope of the data requirements and therefore we are unable to report on this element.    Quartile Pay Bands The proportions and male and female relevant employees in the four quartiles.    No. employees  No. female  No. male  % female  % male  Lower quartile  61  47  14  77.05%  22.95%  Lower middle quartile  109  65  44  59.63%  40.37%  Upper middle quartile  103  66  37  64.08%  35.92%  Upper quartile  73  36  37  49.32%  50.68%  It should be noted that in all but the upper quartile we have a significantly higher percentage of female employees than male employees and the upper quartile is evenly balanced in terms of gender. It is therefore concluded that as our pay gap is 11% that we do have some work to do to redress the balance especially as we have a ratio of 1.62 female employees to every male employee.    Comparison to other organisations The table below shows ONS data detailing the sector gender pay gap for 2017. TBC’s gender pay gap is significantly lower than the national averages for both public and private sector organisations.     Our Next Steps  Develop an action plan which endeavours to improve our gender pay gap to support our diversity and equality action plan.  Include the gender pay gap details and action plan in our annual pay policy.  Review our Diversity and Equality scheme to take into account gender pay gap issues.  Calculate the gender pay gap for the snapshot date of 31st March 2018 by 31st May 2018.
