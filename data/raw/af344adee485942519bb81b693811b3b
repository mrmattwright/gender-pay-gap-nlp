OUR 2017 GENDER PAY GAP REPORT  

  

 

Our business is dependent on recruiting, retaining, developing and motivating talented people. The 
talents we need do not depend on gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnic or national origin, race 
colour, age, disability or socio-economic background. We recognise that we need to do more to appeal to 
everyone who could help us to success.

The data shows that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across the business in the 
UK. The gender pay gap is driven by the underrepresentation of women in the upper quartiles, which 
include the senior leadership teams. We are committed to a number of actions that will close that gap 
and redress the gender imbalance at the top of the organisation.  

We confirm the data reported is accurate.
