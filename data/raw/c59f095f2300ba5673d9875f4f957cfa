The trust is committed to ensuring an equitable workforce and we will continue to work towards achieving the following actions:   Undertake an annual review of gender split across all bands as part of the annual Public Sector equality Duty process and take action where appropriate.  To continue to encourage women consultants to apply for CEA awards.  Review exit and retention data to better understand any concerns raised relating to gender pay progression and to identify and implement actions to improve this.  To consider our approach to flexible working for all staff, to establish whether more can be done to improve flexible working within North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust.   The requirement to undertake gender pay gap reporting became mandatory for all public sector employers from 31 March 2017 in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
