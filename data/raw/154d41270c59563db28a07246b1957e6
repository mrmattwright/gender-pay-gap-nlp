Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 2

The gender pay 
gap explained

The new Gender Pay Gap Regulations in the UK 
require employers with greater than 250 employees 
to report their gender pay gap in line with specific 
criteria. This report is based on data at April 2017. 

The gender pay gap is different from ‘equal pay’. Equal pay is the 
difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same 
or similar jobs or jobs of equal value.

What is a gender pay gap?

The gender pay gap represents the difference in the average hourly 
earnings of men and women across a business regardless of the role 
they do. The gap can be impacted by a number of factors, including the 
number of men and women in all roles throughout the company. As a 
result of different jobs paying different rates and the number of men 
and women performing those jobs being variable – a gender pay gap 
may exist.

The gender pay 
gap explained
Median gender pay gap
The median shows the middle point of the
group. If all employees within the company
were lined up in a female and male line, in
order of pay – the median pay gap is the
difference between the hourly rate of pay for
the woman in the middle compared with the
hourly rate of pay for the man in the middle.

Understanding the 
pay gap at Vision Express

At Vision Express 89% of the total 
employees in quartiles 1 and 2 are store 
based employees on fixed rates of pay 
linked to training level and expertise. If we 
were to calculate the gender pay gap for 
this population (Q1 & Q2) of our team there 
would be a median pay gap of 0% and a 
mean pay gap of 0.6%.

UK national average pay gap estimated at median 18.4% and mean 17.4% at 2017*.

Quartile four 
accounts for the 
highest paid 
and/or more senior roles 
within Vision Express.

77.8%  

of these are registered 
optical professionals.

*Source Office for National Statistics.

Recruitment into registered optical professional roles is highly competitive and has been for many 
years. Pay for those roles is commensurate to the qualification and determined by several factors 
including experience, time qualified and the level of competition within the job market at the time 
of recruitment (often the supply of optical professionals is significantly less than the demand for 
them). The variable mix of these factors at a point in time can contribute to a gender pay gap.

Whilst overall the percentage of females within our business is higher than males, 
there is a greater proportion of men than women in more senior and / or higher 
paid roles resulting in a gender pay gap.

Gender Gap - Bonus

Performance related bonus schemes operate for a number 
of management and registered optical professional roles 
within our business.

investment in variable performance related bonus.
