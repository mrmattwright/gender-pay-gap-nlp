It’s about investing in our colleagues – helping them to be as professional, successful, happy and healthy as possible.  There are three pillars to the Programme; Career, Mind and Body.

Head Shed  The Head Shed programme provides the opportunity for employees to participate in an engaging and innovative set of activities and workshops from leading experts and academics focusing on promoting positive mental health and wellbeing in the workplace and at home.

The full programme of events varies from location to location with the initiatives being led by local Be at Your Best champions.      Living Partnership  Bank of Ireland UK brought its unique partnership strategy to life for colleagues who work in and support the business as part of an engaging series of events in 2016 and 2017 to engage employees in our strategy. More than 2,000 employees attended one of 12 ‘Partnership Bank Live’ events, held in 5 different locations across Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Colleagues learnt about Bank of Ireland UK’s purpose, strategy and values, and heard about Living Partnership – a common thread which connects our business strategy with how we work together and deliver, in partnership, for our customers, partners, stakeholders and each other.  More than 300 colleagues have now signed up to be Living Partnership shapers, helping to shape the next steps on our partnership journey during 2017, and strengthening the importance of partnership in the offices and Branches where we work – all with the aim of creating a collaborative, empowering and successful place to work for themselves and their colleagues.
