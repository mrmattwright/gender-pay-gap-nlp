LCP Gender Pay  
Report 2017

This report shows a snapshot of the 
difference in average earnings for LCP’s 
employees as at 5 April 2017, as required 
by law.
LCP is already committed to supporting increased Diversity and 
Inclusion and has a number of initiatives in place to support this aim, 
with others planned for the future.  Further details of these are set out 
on our website.  We expect a number of these initiatives to result in 
our gender pay gap reducing in the future. 

Understanding the gap
The gender pay gap is different to equal pay - LCP does not pay men and 
women differently for the same or equivalent work.  

Our gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women 
work within the firm, and the salaries that these roles attract.  Like 
many other professional services firms, LCP currently has more men 
than women in senior, higher paid positions and more women than 
men in lower paid positions.  

Our gender bonus gap is predominantly driven by two factors. The 
first is that there are more men in senior positions where bonuses 
as a percentage of salary are higher. Secondly, whilst the pay gap 
calculation adjusts for the impact of part-time hours (by calculating 
average hourly pay), the bonus calculation does not. Many of our part-
time members of staff are women, and typically working fewer hours 
leads to a lower bonus.

Pay quartiles by gender

The mean gender pay gap is calculated as the 
difference between the mean hourly rate of pay 
of male and female employees expressed as a 
percentage of the mean hourly rate of pay of  
male employees.

The mean gender bonus gap is calculated as the 
difference between the mean bonus of male and 
female employees expressed as a percentage of the 
mean bonus of male employees.    

The median figures are calculated in a similar way.  

Pay quartiles are derived from standard hourly rates.

All numbers shown in this report have been 
calculated using the standard methodologies 
used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017.
