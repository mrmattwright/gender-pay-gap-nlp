As an employer with over 250 employees, North London Collegiate School is required to submit a 
Gender Pay Gap Report annually.  The information is available on the School’s website and on the 
government online reporting system and is based on April 2017 data.  The data has been signed off 
by the School Governors. 
 
Please note that the gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay.  Equal pay is the requirement that 
men and women doing the same job should be paid the same. The purpose of the gender pay gap 
report is to identify any differences in the average hourly earnings of all men and women, enabling 
organisations to take remedial action. 
 
The results for North London Collegiate School are as follows: 
 
Mean Gender Pay Gap:  7.5% 
Median Gender Pay gap:  7.1% 
 
The current national average is 18%. 
 
The proportion of males and females in each quartile is as follows: 
 
Pay Quartiles 
Lower Quartile 
 
Lower Middle Quartile 
Upper Middle Quartile  
Upper Quartile 
 
The School does not pay bonuses so the requirement to report on this is not applicable.  
 
I confirm that the calculations are an  accurate representation of the School’s position at 5th April 
2017.
