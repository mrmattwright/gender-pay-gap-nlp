The Chair of the Trust is Nikki King OBE, Honorary Chairman of Isuzu Truck (UK) Limited and the CEO is Andy Reese, formerly the Head teacher of Greenacre Academy.  The Trust is governed by an overarching Trust Board, with significant powers delegated to the local governing bodies.  The Trust vision is for Skills for Life to pervade the curriculum and extra-curricular activity. In addition to the normal school diet, the Trust aims to prepare our students for the adults that they are to become through teaching life skills and exposing them to a whole range of potential careers and mentors from the business world both locally and regionally.  Our Trust facilitates the sharing of good practice across all our academies so that the impact of the best strategies is felt by all. This approach enables governors, leaders, teachers and support staff to come together supported by a common ethos.  Each academy is a giver and receiver of support irrespective of their Ofsted grading or performance table position.  The following central services have been set up to enable school leaders to concentrate on the quality of teaching and the raising of standards: HR, Finance, Admin, Data, IT Network and Skills for Life. Each academy pays a levy which pays for them.
