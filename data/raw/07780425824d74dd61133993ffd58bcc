Vaulkhard Group Limited – Gender Pay Gap Report 2018       Meet The Directors       Oliver Vaulkhard  Ollie has worked in the licensed industry since the late 80’s and at all levels of the trade. In 1995, he opened the companies first venue, the Quilted Camel on Newcastle’s Quayside, a venue the company still owns today and is held close to the hearts of the directors. In the subsequent years, the group has grown its number of venues, but always tried to keep the family feel, which culminated in a group re-structure when the Vaulkhard name became the brand. Working alongside Harry and Sarah and a tight team of senior management, Ollie’s responsibilities have changed from the early days as ‘the Quilted Camel dogs body ‘to his current role as ‘Vaulkhard Group dogs body’. If a decision needs making it’s often crossed Ollie’s desk. The business activities have grown to include gastro bars, late night venues, coffee shops, tea rooms and delis as well as a prestigious property portfolio in the city of Newcastle. Still actively involved in every aspect of the business and with a passion for the industry and the region, Ollie is proud to call Newcastle home, despite his roots being 100 miles south….       Harry Vaulkhard   Over the past five years Harry has overseen operations at Pacific House and Blakes Coffee & Kitchen. Pacific House is a gastro bar in Newcastle which underwent a major refurbishment in 2012, while Blakes is one of Tyneside’s premier coffee and food outlets situated on the iconic Grey St.  Harry has a keen passion for motor sport, and to-date is three time British Champion in three different categories, having also raced on the World stage in recent years. Harry was also one of the founder members of Bamboo Engineering, a Motorsport team that has won World Championships of which he still sits on the board.  As the new group forms, Harry will take the experience of the existing directors and management team, and inject fresh energy and youthful eyes to ongoing operations.        Sarah Cook  Sarah started her career in the leisure industry as a Bartender whilst studying for a law degree. After graduating she took a job at a newly opened bar, Quilted Camel, on Newcastle’s Quayside. Fifteen years later Sarah is one of five of the original line up still working for Vaulkhard Group.  During that time Sarah was promoted from Bartender to Assistant Manager before joining the head office team in the role of Administrator, responsible for payroll, accounts, EPOS programming and stock control. As the company grew and expanded its workforce,  Sarah’s role within the head office grew and she became responsible for a small team of accounts staff.  Today Sarah is the eyes and ears for the company, ensuring the day-to-day smooth running of the venues, whilst still overseeing the accounts and general office team.                           © Vaulkhard Group 2015.
