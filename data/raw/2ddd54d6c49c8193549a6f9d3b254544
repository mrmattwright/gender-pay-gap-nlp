We challenge our people to deliver the right results for our clients and users and reward them for contributing to our success.    In simple terms, we want all our people to be their best. 

To help them achieve this, we know it's our responsibility to provide the support and opportunity that will enable all our people to grow, learn and develop.      Strength in diversity  As a global business, we recognise and celebrate our diversity; it's a strength that makes us inclusive and cohesive. Having an understanding of different cultures and attitudes, underpinned by our shared values, allows us to embrace different perspectives that increase our ability to listen, learn, create and innovate.              UK Gender Pay Gap  We welcome the Gender Pay Gap legislation and are committed to increasing the representation of women within our business, and especially at senior levels. We’re driven by a continuing desire to make IRESS a great place to work, where the diverse experience, attitude and background of all our people underpins our success.

Our UK people told us that:       believe IRESS values diversity      believe their people leader genuinely supports equality and inclusion for all      believe they have the flexibility they need to manage their work, so they have a good work/life balance          Download our most recent Gender Pay Gap Report PDF   PDF Download (280KB)        Our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion  We have key business priorities that focus on diversity and inclusion. We expect all our people to understand the importance of these priorities and, where possible, contribute to their achievement. All people (and all our new starters) have undertaken inclusion training and all people leaders are expected to recognise and challenge unconscious bias.            Action speaks louder than words  Our enhanced leave policies, flexible working practices, engagement with local STEM programmes, recruitment and selection processes and graduate programmes all support and encourage diversity. We know we can do more and we are committed to doing more.   "The culture at IRESS is one of openness, inclusion and innovation. Whether I am speaking to my local team, colleagues across the globe or our CEO, I feel my opinion is important and considered."  Sara Row - Senior Solutions Consultant   "Following the birth of my second child, I needed to take extended leave to help care for my family - IRESS supported me amazingly in terms of flexibility. "  Stephen Cowdell - Key Account Manager   "My People Leader supports my career growth and development. He encourages me to step outside of my comfort zone, learn new skills and be the best I can."  Megan Smith - Commercial Analyst   "IRESS is a great place to work and I really feel I can make a difference. I love the freedom and opportunity I am given to develop my role, my team and our processes."
