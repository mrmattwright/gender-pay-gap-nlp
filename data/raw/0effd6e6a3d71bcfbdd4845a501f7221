This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee’s data.  The data is drawn from three schools in the Trust:   Writhlington School  Mendip Studio School  Peasedown St John Primary School   We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. We will do this within one calendar year of April 5 th 2017  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace  the balance of male and female employees at different levels  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.     The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.  Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We establish this by using our existing HR and payroll records.  The results of the report for 2017 are as follows:   The Trust follows the trend for the education sector with females making up the higher proportion of our workforce with 73% female and 27% male employees.   In particular, many of the Trust’s support roles are currently filled by female staff.  The majority of support staff, catering staff and cleaning roles are part-time and offer term-time only working with hours that are aligned to the core school day.  These roles attract employees who seek a flexible work pattern.  These posts have historically recruited predominantly female employees.  Dragonfly Education Trust operates as an equal opportunities employer, and takes appropriate steps to ensure that it does not discriminate in any way (as defined by the Equalities Act 2010 and other relevant legislation).   All decisions on pay and performance are made by the Trustees Pay Committee.  Policies and practice will be regularly reviewed to include further identified good practice to tackle and reduce the gender pay gap.   The Trust will monitor this data on an on-going basis.   This initial report will act as a baseline for the Trust to benchmark its data with other organisations and data in future years.  I can confirm that the above information has been prepared from our payroll and financial data from 31 March and fairly presents the Gender Pay Gap information for the Dragonfly Education Trust.
