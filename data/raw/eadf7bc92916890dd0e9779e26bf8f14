−Gender Pay Gap Report 2018 The Gender Pay Gap

The UK government has introduced a requirement on all employers to publish their  
gender pay gap data by April 2018. As an employer, we are committed to equal 

opportunities and since 2015 we have implemented benchmarked pay structures linked to 

the marketplace, promoting fairness and transparency and to reward performance.

We believe that family roots are at the heart of our business and we  

couldn’t do it without our brilliant people!

−Gender Pay Gap Report 2018 Q4

In Quartile 4, we know that this segment largely  

includes highly skilled IT/Technical roles as well as Senior 
Management. Due to a lack of female representation in 

these areas, the majority of employees are male.

Within each quartile, we are confident that men and 
women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs  
due to our pay scales which are determined by skill  

level and performance indicators.

According to the National Office of 
Statistics, the overall UK gender pay gap is 
18.1%. We have a mean gender pay gap 
of 13% (average) and a median (middle) 
gender pay gap of 1% which is smaller 
than the average, but know we have more 
work to do to close the gap. 

We believe in equal job opportunities 
for everybody regardless of gender, but 
we must seek new opportunities to attract 
women into IT/Technical and senior roles 
to widen our female talent pool.

Delivering training and development 
opportunities to our Line Managers to help 
them recognise “unconscious bias” and 
encourage them to shortlist a balanced  
and diverse range of candidates.

We will also continue to ensure that our 
policies and procedures are implemented 
fairly and inclusively, particularly our 
recruitment & selection and performance 
and pay reviews.

In the coming months, we plan to 
implement a “smarter” and more instinctive 
performance management system 
which will enable us to succession plan, 
identifying more talented men and women 
as “high potential” for leadership roles.

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
