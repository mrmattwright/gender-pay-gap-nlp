Responses to Recent Consultations Compensation Cap Factors -  from April 2016 Schemes in Assessment How the PPF is Funded        About Us   In brief, the Pension Protection Fund’s main function is to provide compensation to members of eligible defined benefit pension schemes, when there is a qualifying insolvency event in relation to the employer, and where there are insufficient assets in the pension scheme to cover the Pension Protection Fund level of compensation.  The Pension Protection Fund is a statutory fund run by the Board of the Pension Protection Fund, a statutory corporation established under the provisions of the Pensions Act 2004.  To help fund the Pension Protection Fund, compulsory annual levies are charged on all eligible schemes.  Investing the assets of the Pension Protection Fund effectively is a further key function of the organisation.  The Pension Protection Fund is also responsible for the Fraud Compensation Fund - a fund that will provide compensation to occupational pension schemes that suffer a loss that can be attributable to dishonesty.
