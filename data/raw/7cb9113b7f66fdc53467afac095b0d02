The following information forms part of what HEFCE has described as a Wider Information Set (WIS).  The wider information has two purposes:  To provide information about HE to a wide variety of audiences including: prospective and current students, students’ parents and advisers, employers, the media, and the institution itself;  To form part of the evidence used within quality assurance reviews.

Access Agreement Sets out BGU’s fee limits and the access measures we intend to put in place e.g. outreach work and financial support.
