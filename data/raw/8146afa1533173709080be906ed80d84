O2 welcomes the new legislation requiring organisations with over 250 employees 

to report their gender pay gap. So we’ve put together this report to give more 

detail about our data published on the government’s website.

Statement

Introduction

At O2 we recognise the importance of 
having a diverse, balanced and inclusive 
workforce. To serve our 25 million 
customers best, it’s vital that our workforce 
reflects and understands them.
But beyond making good business sense, 
having a diverse and inclusive workforce is 
about creating happier, more productive 
teams – where everyone is given the 
opportunity to excel and succeed.

Understanding the numbers
At O2, double the number of women work part-time compared to men. Our people tell us 
that they appreciate the flexibility to balance both their professional and personal lives. 

To look at our figures from a different perspective, 
if all these part-time workers became full-time, our 
gap would look very different:

Gender pay gap

Over the years we’ve invested in a range of 
initiatives to create a more diverse, balanced 
and inclusive workforce. We’ve also proactively 
promoted, and participated in, community 
activities to help address the root cause of 
gender pay disparity, such as the shortage of 
women studying STEM subjects or pursuing 
careers in technology.

But our figures highlight that we must do more. 
In particular:

We need more women in STEM and 
senior positions across our business

There are differences in work-life 
patterns between men and women – 
we need to encourage more men to 
embrace flexible working.

What we’re doing 

Supporting 
and developing 
female talent

Our Women in Leadership 
programmes develop and nurture 
top female talent in the business

To help address the lower numbers 
of women in management positions, 
(especially in areas of our business 
that are under-represented), our 
recently launched Career Returners’ 
programme focusses on bringing 
female talent back into the 
workplace.

Leading from  
the top

Creating an 
inclusive culture

Back to  
the future

Our board and executive grades 
show a mean pay gap of 2.0% and 
mean bonus gap of 0.70%.

We encourage the uptake of 
part-time and flexible working 
arrangements.

Diversity and inclusion is a board 
level priority, sponsored by our 
COO Derek McManus. 

We judge performance on quality 
of work, not the number of hours 
our people spend at their desks.

To foster the next generation we 
proactively support, and participate 
in, community initiatives such as 
Speakers for Schools, Step into 
STEM and GoThinkBig.

We specify 50:50 gender short-
lists when recruiting for all senior 
positions.

Statement

Looking to the future
We do not believe in quotas or positive discrimination. We do believe in 
programmes and initiatives that attract the best talent, and foster a culture that 
gives our people the opportunity to succeed, so we also commit to:

50/50 gender short-
lists for all leadership 
roles - not just senior 

positions

Working towards a 

50:50 gender split goal 
for all early career roles 
– i.e. graduates, interns 

and apprentices

Encouraging more 

employees to 

embrace part-time 
and flexible working 

arrangements

 Inspiring more female 
talent into STEM roles 

through work with 

our partners

Ensuring 

unconscious bias 

training for all hiring 

managers
