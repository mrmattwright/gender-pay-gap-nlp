For these reasons, diversity remains a focus for us as a key element of our efforts to ensure AstraZeneca is a great place to work.
In our first Gender Pay Gap Report, we provide gender pay information for AstraZeneca in the UK and outline our plans for supporting women, as well as continuing to improve the diversity of our company globally.
I believe that by truly representing the communities in which we operate, we will both be more successful in developing life-changing medicines and in creating a work environment where everyone can fulfil their potential. That’s why my senior leadership team and I are committed to gender parity and improving diversity at AstraZeneca."
