Each of our schools maintains its own unique identity but we believe that we can achieve more by working together.   ‘A cord of three strands is not easily broken.’ (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12)  PDET is responsible for employing all staff and managing the finances and other central services for the Academies in the Trust. These services include HR support; facilities and premises; procurement and school effectiveness.       Our family of schools seek to serve their local communities; they are inclusive welcoming children of the Christian Faith of other faiths or of no faith, children from all backgrounds and of all abilities.  We believe in the infinite worth of each person: children deserve the very best education and staff merit support to deliver this.  Although the multi-academy trust was formed initially to support church schools, PDET is happy to work with any community school that shares our values.
