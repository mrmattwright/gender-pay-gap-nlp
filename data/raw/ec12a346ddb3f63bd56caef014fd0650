than 250 employees are required to publish details of their gender pay gap and
in particular the difference in average female earnings compared to average
male earnings. The figures for the Thomas Armstrong Group are as follows:   Mean gender pay gap = 27.7%    Median gender pay gap = 21.3%    Mean bonus gender pay gap = 85.4%    Median bonus gender pay gap = 90.2%    Percentage of male and female staff who received a bonus
= 78.5% and 78.1%    The proportion of male and females in each pay quartile:    Lower quartile = 77.1% male and 22.9% female    Lower middle quartile = 91.0% male and 9.0% female    Upper middle quartile = 93.1% male and 6.9% female    Upper quartile = 97.9% male and 2.1% female    For comparison, the workforce is 10% female, 90% male
overall.  The data shows that females are over represented in roles in
the lowest pay quartiles and underrepresented in the top 3 quartiles, in
particular the upper middle and upper quartile. This reflects the traditional
image of the construction and building products industry which is that of a
male dominated workforce operating large machinery, digging holes and pouring
concrete and the dominance of men in the skilled trade’s roles, along with the
associated career routes for these trade-based roles.  Although there is still much that needs to be done, attitudes
to women working in the construction and building products industry have
changed significantly over recent decades. While construction remains a
male-dominated industry, the workforce is at last becoming more gender diverse
and there are now more women working in the industry. Stereotypes surrounding
what are considered to be “male” and “female” roles have also, to a large
extent, been broken down. However, this is not yet being reflected in the
number of women working in the industry. There is obviously more work required
to identify, encourage and equip female employees to take up skilled trade
roles and identify and encourage women who have the potential to grow into more
senior roles.  Thomas Armstrong is committed to working towards closing and
eliminating our gender pay gap in the future and keeping our workforce and
Board regularly updated with progress towards achieving this.
