Our long history of promoting diversity in our ranks began over a half-century ago, with the leadership of one man: Joseph C. Wilson, the first CEO of modern-day Xerox. Thanks to his vision, diversity became a part of our value system.   Today, we have one of the most diverse workforces in the world. Through diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, we gain the benefit of different ways of looking at our business, leading to innovative breakthroughs for our customers and more engaging work for our people.   And we continue to learn and adapt every day. We build and sustain a global workforce and supply base that represent and connect with the different people and communities we serve. In today’s changing, connected world, our shared commitments to respect each other and listen to each other remain critical to our success.

Through teamwork, professionalism, respect and inclusiveness, we create an environment where our people can achieve their goals and make our clients more successful.  We recognize that diversity and inclusion gains will not be sustained unless our workplace promotes and encourages new ways of problem-solving and diversity of thought.  To that end, we promote understanding and inclusion through a comprehensive set of diversity initiatives and strategies:   Our balanced workforce strategy drives equitable people representation in all areas of our company, all around the world.  Our work-life programs assist our people in the many aspects of their personal lives.  We educate all of our people on diversity programs, policies and achievements. And, we ensure diversity and inclusion principles are communicated to all of our people.  We continually develop and evolve strategies that leverage diversity to gain a competitive global advantage and to drive market excellence.  Our supplier diversity program ensures we are actively committed to purchasing supplies and products from small and diverse enterprises.  We address diversity disparities by identifying shortfalls and closing those gaps.\   Gender Pay Gap Report for 2017  UK legislation * requires employers to disclose the percentage difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women.
