There are also specific regulatory bodies we must comply with including the Care Quality Commission and the  Fundraising Regulator .

To apply their expertise in confidentiality and data protection to cases involving patient information.  To oversee all arrangements and relationships with other organisations or individuals involving the sharing of patient information, whether for clinical reasons or otherwise.
