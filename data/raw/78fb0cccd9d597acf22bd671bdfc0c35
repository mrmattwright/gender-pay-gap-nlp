The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings for men and women. This is calculated by adding up all the pay for all the men and dividing it by the number of hours they worked, and doing the same for the women and comparing the numbers. Note the Gender Pay Gap is not Equal Pay for men and women performing the same role, something that has been a legal requirement for 50 years.   Holiday Extras Ltd  Established: 1983  Employees: 680  Male/Female Ratio: 39:61  Average Age: 33  Voluntary Leavers: 12%  Earning >Â£35k: 20%  2018 Times Top 100 Position: 93      Holiday Extras gender pay gap data is as follows:     Mean  Median      Pay gap  36.3%  36.4%           This means that women are paid an average of 36.3% less per hour than men employed by Holiday Extras. The reasons for this are explained below.  Viewed as quartiles (the total Holiday Extras team, split into four equal sized groups from the lowest to the highest rate of pay across the business) the distribution of pay is as follows:     Holiday Extras gender pay gap data is as follows:    Quartile  Female  Male      Upper  32%  68%    Upper middle  57%  43%    Lower middle  78%  22%    Lower  75%  25%     What makes up the gender pay gap?    A large proportion (24% of the 36.3%) of our gender pay gap is made up of two factors. The first is a strong representation of women in the lower to lower mid quartiles as these roles tend to offer more flexible working opportunities, that suit people who wish to work on a part time basis. We have over twice as many women working part time than men in the lower to lower mid quartiles. The second is we have a higher representation of men in the upper quartile roles.          Bonus Data     Mean  Median      Bonus gap  50.2%  30.6%     What makes up the gender bonus gap?  Because we pay bonuses as a percentage of salary the gap between men and women is driven by more men in the Upper Quartile of pay. An equal distribution of men and women across all pay quartiles would close the gap.     Distribution of Bonus     Received Bonus  No Bonus      Women  92%  8%    Men  89%  11%     The number of men and women receiving bonuses is broadly equal. The 3% gap is a result of more women joining the business than men and the business not paying a bonus during our onboarding period.  Actions  These are some of the new things we will be doing to address our gender pay gap:   We will review all recruitment, succession planning, internal progression opportunities and promotions to ensure they are solely based on performance and potential without gender bias.  We plan to extend our flexible working policy to all levels of the team.  We will explore options for moving away from bonuses paid as a percentage of salary to address the distribution of bonus.   Summary  We acknowledge our gender pay gap is above average due to more women in Lower Quartile roles and more men in Upper Quartile Roles.  Holiday Extras has always offered equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. All roles are independently benchmarked by an external organisation every other year. We are an Accredited Living Wage Employer and a Sunday Times 100 Best Company to Work For.  We have clear and fair policies for employing the best people we can find.
