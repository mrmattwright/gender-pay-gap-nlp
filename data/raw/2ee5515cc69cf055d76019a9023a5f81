GENDER PAY GAP  

REPORT 2017

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?

Legislation introduced in April 2017 requires all employers of 250 or more employees to publish 
their gender pay gap as of 5th April 2017. The gender pay gap is the difference between the 
average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings, in an organisation.

Gender pay gaps are common across many industries, and are widely reported to be driven by 
fewer women than men holding senior roles within their respective organisations.

OUR GENDER PAY GAP

“

At Universal Music, diversity and inclusion isn’t driven by 
compliance or obligation. Success in our fast-evolving industry 
depends on us attracting people from all kinds of backgrounds, 
and having a team that truly reflects and supports the incredible 
diversity of our artist roster and society.

“

Uniquely in the UK music industry, two of our five “frontline” labels 
are now led by female presidents – promotions not reflected in 
the period covered by this report.

The Gender Pay Report we are publishing today, which covers 
every Universal Music employee based in the UK, shows a gender 
pay gap which is unacceptable to us. The gap is due to having 
fewer women than men in senior positions, something we are 
addressing.

We have put in place several measures to accelerate our efforts to 
promote inclusion and diversity in all its forms. 

Our industry-leading paid intern scheme has seen more than 400 
interns come through our doors since 2009, more than half of 
them women. It has provided many the crucial first opportunity to 
get their foot in the industry’s proverbial door.

However we understand that encouraging a diverse range of 
people to join us is just one step, so we are also focused on 
career development to foster the advancement of our female 
executives. Growing numbers of our staff are now being mentored 
or coached – especially women embarking on and returning from 
maternity leave. Alongside our family-friendly policies, we offer 
bespoke development programmes, with more than two-thirds of 
those who benefited in 2017 being women.

It’s worth noting that our headline pay gap figures are influenced 
by bonuses paid to senior A&R staff, an area of the music business 
which is still male-dominated. To help address that, we have put in 
place, and are continuing to build, a development plan to increase 
the number of women in our A&R teams to more closely reflect 
the overall 50:50 gender splits in our frontline labels.

The average pay gap between women and men at Universal is 
reducing, although it has been a long-term transition. Since 2007 
our median gender pay gap has fallen from 30.3% to 16.7%, while 
our mean pay gap has reduced from 37.7% to 29.8%. 

Despite this progress, we are very clear that there is still much 
more to be done. Diversity and inclusion is, and will remain, at the 
very top of our agenda.
