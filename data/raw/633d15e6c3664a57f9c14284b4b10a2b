 The Arthur Terry Learning Partnership Gender Pay Gap Narrative  Introduction  All companies, including schools/multi-academy trusts, with 250 or more employees are now required to publish their gender pay gap under new legislation which came into force in April 2017.  The snapshot date for relevant employees is 31st March 2017.  The gender pay gap is the difference between the hourly rate of pay of male employees and female employees (as set out in the regulations), expressed as a percentage of the hourly pay rate of the male employees.    Employers are required to provide data which shows any gap in the hourly rate between men and women, on both a median basis (the middle of the range), and the mean basis (the average of all in the range).    In addition, employers are required to show the distribution of gender, the number of men and women, across four equal quartiles.  Employers are also required to disclose the percentage of staff receiving a bonus and the gender gap in bonus payments.  The Gender Pay Gap at The Arthur Terry Learning Partnership (The ATLP) Breakdown of employees (male/female)  Overall the Trust has 75.5% female and 24.5% male workforce.  The percentage of female members of staff is higher across all four quartiles of the organisation, but in quartiles 1 to 3, the breakdown of females to males is broadly the same, but in quartile four, at more senior positions, there are fewer females.

The overall gender pay gap for The ATLP, as at 31st March 2017, based on the mean hourly rate, is 11.68%.  Narrative  The ATLP are confident that the gender pay gap identified, albeit moderate, is not an issue which arises out of unequal treatment based on gender.  The ATLP approach to pay is gender neutral, with pay decisions based on The ATLP pay policy.  Pay scales within The ATLP are based on the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document, and for support staff we apply the pay scales which were inherited from Birmingham City Council, which are based on NJC pay values, and have been assessed through job evaluation.   The data identifies there are a significantly higher number of female to male employees across The ATLP in all quartiles.  However, the pay gaps in each quartile are different, with women at the lower end earning more than men, and, at the top end, men earning more than women.  What our data shows is that typically, there are more females than males in roles which are at the lower end of the pay band. A large proportion of these roles are part-time and/or term time only.  These roles tend to attract more women to apply, as they offer the hours and flexibility to fit around childcare, which in the UK is still traditionally a female activity.  Males tend to want to apply for roles which are full time.    Having said this in Q1, women earn marginally more than men, with the mean salary for women being 5.65% (0.41p per hour) higher, and the median salary being 2.02% (0.15p per hour) higher.  One explanation for this difference is that at this level, there are more women with longer service than men.  Generally, more women are attracted to working in schools to have shorter working days to match their children’s school day, and time off in school holidays, to fit around child care commitments.  Once working in a school, many women will remain there for many years, working their way through the grade structure, with increases each year based on performance, until they reach the top of the grade.  Men who take up roles in this quartile tend to be more mobile and the turnover is higher, with male employees not always reaching the top of their grade before leaving to take up other jobs which are generally higher paid, or are not pro rata to term time only, outside of the school sector.    In Q2, the salary for women and men is broadly equal, with the mean salary for women being 1.63% less than men.  This equates to 0.18p per hour less.  The median salary is identical and there is no gender pay gap.   In Q3, based on the mean salary, women earn 4.73% (0.80p per hour) less than men, and based on the median salary this is 2.14% (0.34p per hour).  One of the causes of the gap at this level which has been experienced within The ATLP is where, following maternity leave, many female teachers choose to relinquish additional responsibility and hours due to child care responsibilities.  Feedback from these women has been that the role of a teacher is extremely pressurised, with significant marking, planning and preparation being undertaken at home during evening and weekends, coupled with the additional leadership responsibilities, they choose to surrender the additional responsibility of a middle leader role to have more quality time with family.  The ATLP have already put in place a number of work-life balance initiatives and are committed to enhancing these and to promoting smarter working practices.  In addition, we have seen an increase in the number of male teachers requesting flexible working.  In Q4, the gap widens, and women in leadership positions earn £1.31 (4.79%) per hour less than men (mean), and £1.27 (4.92%) per hour less than men on a median basis.  This is influenced by the way the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document determines the salary levels at primary and secondary level.  Salaries are determined according to pupil numbers, age weighting, and school sizes, which therefore translates that secondary heads are paid higher than primary heads, as traditionally primary schools are smaller in size to secondary schools.  Even where primary schools have higher pupil numbers, the ages are weighted with secondary weighting being greater than primary.  Although there are a higher number of women than men in this quartile, the women tend to be predominantly from the primary sector, which has lower pay levels.  There are two executive roles (males) which have transferred from secondary education, and one from primary education (female), and this has also had the effect of skewing the figures somewhat.  Removal of these posts would reduce the mean salary gap to £0.05p (0.19%) in Q4.    The ATLP does not pay any bonus payments and so therefore has no data to present and no gender pay gap relating to bonus payments.  Comparison (data from Local Government Association/.gov.uk website, as at 12th February 2018  https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/Viewing/search-results  There are 27 organisations with “academy” or “academies” in their organisational name: The median “mean hourly pay gap” for this sample is 24.9%  The median “median hourly pay gap” for this sample is 36.3% There are 20 organisations with “school” in their organisational name: The median “mean hourly pay gap” for this sample is 16.1% The median “median hourly pay gap” for this sample is 24.85% The overall figures for these 47 organisations The median “mean hourly pay gap” for this sample is 20% The median “median hourly pay gap” for this sample is 31.9%  What does this mean for The ATLP?  Whilst the gender pay gap data presented for The ATLP compares favourably with many other education establishments and private organisations, we must not be complacent and we must seek to continually close the gap further.    Actions The ATLP can take to support this are:   Continue with equal opportunity recruitment practices.  Using gender neutral language in job adverts  Using a variety of channels to attract a diverse field of candidates  Offer part time and flexible working opportunities for both male and female employees on an equal basis regardless of gender, and work to overcome any cultural views and restrictions to flexible working.  Continue with and seek to enhance, well-being, work-life balance initiatives and promote smarter working practices.   Continue to maximise and encourage development and progression opportunities for all employees, regardless of gender.  Undertake a review of pay scales across the partnership, for both teaching and support staff taking in to account the national changes on support staff pay due to the changes to the minimum and living wage.  Continue with fair and consistent application of The ATLP pay policy across the MAT.  Implement the national pay award recommendations   Work with the children in The ATLP to remove stereotypes and gender bias.        Statutory Information  Difference in mean and median hourly rate of pay  Difference in the mean hourly rate of pay Difference in the median hourly rate of pay Pay gap difference as a % 11.68% 8.95%  Difference in the mean and median bonus pay  Difference in the mean hourly rate of pay Difference in the median hourly rate of pay Pay gap difference as a % Not applicable Not applicable  Proportion of Males and females in each quartile band See table on page 1                  Appendix 1                         Male Mean Female Mean Gap %     Male Median Female Median Gap % Q1 £7.26 £7.67 -£0.41 -5.65   Q1 £7.43 £7.58 -£0.15 -2.02 Q2 £11.02 £10.84 £0.18 1.63   Q2 £10.84 £10.84 £0.00 0.00 Q3 £16.91 £16.11 £0.80 4.73   Q3 £15.90 £15.56 £0.34 2.14 Q4 £27.35 £26.04 £1.31 4.79   Q4 £25.83 £24.56 £1.27 4.92
