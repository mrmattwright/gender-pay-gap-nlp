Our pupils enjoy good teaching and our teachers enjoy the liveliness of bright pupils. Success in examinations is one consequence of this, but we think it more important to encourage boys to love learning.      • Activities • Dons by Department - Teaching Staff • Careers and Higher Education • Curriculum • Division • Exams and Universities • School Trips • Societies and Clubs • Sports         Enterprises     Enterprises  Winchester College Enterprises is responsible for the use of all College facilities by members of the public outside of term time.      • Facilities Hire • Guided Tours • Wells Bookshop • Wykeham Sports Club • Wykeham Squash Club         Libraries     Libraries  Winchester's oldest records are housed in the purpose built room in which they were always intended to be housed.

It is in A5 format and illustrated in black and white. Much of the material relates to intra-School matters but it also has a strong awareness of contemporary issues - national and international - and at times a biting and provocative tone.    Spirit Lamp  The original Spirit Lamp came to prominence-some might say notoriety-when its editor, Sandy Wason, sold it to a Magdalen undergraduate and Old Wykehamist, Lord Alfred Douglas late in 1892. Bosie, as he was known to his friends, already had publishing experience behind him: at Winchester he had co-founded and edited a magazine called The Pentagram . From December 1892 to June 1893, he published poetry and prose in five issues of the Spirit Lamp , which bore the new subtitle 'An Aesthetic, Literary and Critical Magazine'. The Spirit Lamp was reincarnated in 2006 and is a biannual publication; it is written and edited entirely by boys in the school but overseen by a don. It currently turns a small profit: we hope Lord Alfred Douglas would be proud.  Trusty Servant  This is the major publication of Winchester College Society and is primarily written for Old Wykehamists but because of its interesting content has a sizeable following among current staff and students.  Trusty Servant   The Wykehamist  This is the principal School magazine and official record of events. Edited by twelve boys under the supervision of the Headmaster, it is published thrice a year and provides the editors with an opportunity to learn and develop skills in journalism, feature writing and layout. The first number was published in October 1866. Over the decades it has taken on various styles and formats. Currently it is presented in simple newspaper format. Here is the current number of The Wykehamist .   Further books on the School and books in general can be bought from book sellers P&G Wells who have been on their site next to the School for over 200 years.              » Employment Opportunities  » Schools Competition Act Settlement Trust  » Public Benefit  » Site Map  » Privacy Policy
