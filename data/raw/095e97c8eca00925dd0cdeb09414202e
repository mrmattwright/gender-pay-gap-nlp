Gender Pay Gap Report 2018

Wardell Armstrong Gender Pay Gap Report 2018

It is a legal requirement in the UK that employers with over 250 staff publish an 
analysis of pay by gender on an annual basis. We welcome the introduction of the 

mandatory reporting as a positive step in transparency around pay and gender parity.  

At the time of writing 59% of staff in the business are male and 41% are female.

   Gender Pay Gap

   Wardell Armstrong’s Pay Gap

The Gender Pay Gap analysis looks at the difference 
between hourly rates of pay between women and 
men. Two of the key figures required to be published 
are the mean and median gaps. The mean is the sum 
of all hourly salary rates divided by the number of staff 
with a comparison provided between women and 
men. The median is the difference between the 
middle hourly salary rates for women and men.

We have a mean gender pay gap of 20.8% and a
median gender pay gap of 20.7%. Our figures show a 
similar or better picture to most other organisations 
operating in our sector. The principal factor behind 
the imbalance is not men being paid more than 
women for doing the same job, but differences in 
the spread of men and women across different roles 
and grades and in particular a higher proportion of 
women in administration and support roles and a 
lower proportion of women in more senior roles.

   Equal Pay

Gender Pay Gap analysis is distinct from Equal Pay 
which relates to what women and men are paid for 
doing the same or similar jobs. It is illegal to pay 
different amount to women and men doing the 
same role just because of difference in gender. We 
have robust systems in place to make sure that we 
have no disparity in pay between women and men 
doing the same roles.

   The Proportion of Employees in Each Quartile Pay Band

The imbalance is affected by a greater 
overall percentage of staff being male 
and current and historic lower levels of 
female representation in some of our 
discipline areas, notably engineering 
and mining. This in part has been 
driven by shortages of women training 
and qualifying in those areas; for 
example even now only 25% of all 
graduates in science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics are 
women and in engineering and 
technology the figure is 14%.

Commenting on the pay gap Manging Director 
Keith Mitchell welcomed publication of the figures:
“Providing focus around pay and gender parity is incredibly 
positive and is to be welcomed. There is no doubt that 
our figures, and the figures for others in our sector, 
are significantly affected by shortages of women who 
train now and have trained historically in sciences and 
engineering. We are better than many in our sector but 
we are committed to focusing on the pay gap and we are 
actively looking at how we better attract, engage, develop 
and promote women. At grass roots level we are engaged 
with schools to provide positive insight in to the benefits 
to young women and men in studying sciences and 
engineering and we plan to increase that engagement 
over the coming year. We are also actively engaged 
with a number of graduate programmes with the 
same objectives in mind.”
