Gender Pay Analysis 

What is the Gender Pay Gap? 
 
The gender pay gap is an equality measure that shows the difference in average earnings between women and men over a standard time period.  
The gender pay gap reporting is a valuable tool for assessing levels of equality in the workplace. 
 
From April 2017, all organisations that employ over 250 employees are required by law to carry out this report under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender 
Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  The information used to produce the reports is based on data as at 5 April 2017.  The information must be 
published within one year of the relevant snapshot date (before March 30th of the following calendar year). 
 
The results must be published on the employer’s own website and a government site. 
 
The gender pay gap report is used to calculate the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation, it does not 
measure equal pay.  First Milk is committed to treating all male and female employees equally in their terms and conditions of employment including 
pay. 
 
Our Gender Pay Gap 
 
The UK gender pay gap is at its lowest level ever - just over 18 per cent.  First Milk’s median gender pay gap is sitting at 5.2% which is significantly 
lower than in the UK pay gap.  

 

The gap is primarily driven by our manufacturing sites where the majority of roles are held by men, consistent with the wider manufacturing sector.  
 
Reporting 
 
FM and FMCC are registered as separate entities and each employs fewer than 250 employees so we are not legally bound to publish a report for 
either company.  In line with one of our values around fairness and integrity, we have taken the decision to publish our group information, however, 
even though it is not mandatory.

This shows that in common with many other businesses, particularly those in our sector, we employ many more males than 
females particularly within our manufacturing sites.

Median gender pay gap 

     5.2% 

The median pay gap for employees across our business is 5.2%, significantly lower than the Office of National Statistics 
(ONS) Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) median of 18.4%.   
 
The gap is primarily driven by our manufacturing sites where the majority of roles are held by men, consistent with the 
wider manufacturing sector.

           9.3% 

The bonus calculations are taken from the 12 month period ending on the snapshot date of 5 April 2017. 
 
The gap in average bonus pay is due to the fact that we have fewer females in our most senior management grades.  
 

Proportion of males & females 
receiving a bonus 

Our company bonus is based on business and individual KPI’s and is paid to all employees when the targets are met. 
 
The employees who have not received a bonus have either not been employed at the time the bonus was paid out or had not 
been employed in the business long enough to qualify for a bonus.

The pay quartiles show the proportion of male and female employees in each of the quartile pay bands.  The split at the lower 
quartile is fairly even but the other three quartiles show a vast difference.  This could be attributed to the vast majority of roles 
being held by men but also that the majority of senior roles are held by men.
