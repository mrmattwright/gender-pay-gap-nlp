Gender Pay Gap Information
We are required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting 
under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017 and publish this data on our website and 
the government website within one calendar year of the 5th 
April 2017. 
The required snapshot data was assessed on the 5th April 
2017 using the existing HR and payroll records from our 
Group Head Office at Donaldson House in Glenrothes, Fife. 
This provided our six calculations showing the difference 
between the average earnings of men and women in the 
company. 
At this date Donaldson Timber Engineering employee 
numbers totalled 347 – 303 (87%) men and 44 (13%) women.

Comments:
•  Our production and factory employees account for 65% of the 

workforce and are hourly paid. The percentage bonus split for men 
and women is the result of the consolidation of production bonus 
into the hourly rate a number of years ago.  An all employee survey 
raised the issue of bonus payment for all staff and a bonus has been 
identified and introduced in the 2017-18 Financial Year for hourly 
paid production employees. 

•  Women make up only 13% of the workforce and the results of the 
mean gender pay gap demonstrate a negative of 5.7%. However, 
in terms of median comparison, as a result of the women being 
office based salaried staff, and the majority being trained designer, 
the median gap is 10.3% more. This statistical anomaly therefore 
demonstrates a positive gender pay gap within Donaldson Timber 
Engineering.

•  The industry has historically been male dominated, with shift 
working and manual handling not routinely attracting female 
recruits.  We are, however, committed to breaking down any 
stereotypical barriers and beliefs that traditional manufacturing 
should be a male dominated environment.
