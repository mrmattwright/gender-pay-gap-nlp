We empower our clients to achieve more,  dedicated to helping them succeed          Home        About Us        Responsible Business          Our People  So let’s start with you – and your own distinct strengths, ambitions, priorities and perspectives. These elements are what make you different from everyone else, and they from you.  We’ve worked assiduously to create an environment where people with different talents, cultures and outlooks benefit from working together – and so offer our clients a much greater range and depth of knowledge and experience.  Diversity in action doesn’t happen by itself, but because ordinary people make it happen. Our own advances stem from the work of some very passionate and committed individuals.  In the past five years, our employees have built up a thriving in-house Diversity Employee Network, spanning a broad cross-section of offices, practice groups and roles.  Along the way, we’ve reached a few milestones – from being the first law firm to become a Diversity Champion on Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index, to achieving a Silver award in the Opportunity Now gender diversity benchmark in 2014.  And it doesn’t end here. Diversity is a live and constantly evolving business issue, and we’re intent on extending the reach and effectiveness of our actions across our business globally.  We are committed to encouraging  everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation (including gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender), marital or civil partner status, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, disability, age or pregnancy to realise their full potential.  Push for change, and you’ll be pushing at an open door.  Click here to read more about our commitment to 'Our People', including Project Sky and our work on gender diversity.
