It tells local authorities where to direct their services; it shows us if certain people aren’t making the most of them; and it makes sure that you get the right slice of what you’re paying for.  What information do we ask for on our diversity monitoring form?  Our full equality and diversity monitoring form asks for seven pieces of information. They are:   Gender  Age  Disability  Sexual Orientation  Religion or Belief  National Identity  Ethnicity   Why do we need this information?  We have a legal and a moral duty to eliminate all forms of discrimination when employing people and when delivering services.  We are committed to delivering excellent services, but we can only do this if we understand who our customers are and what particular needs they have.  How have the ethnicity categories been decided upon?  The six main ethnicity categories we have used are those used in the 2001 Census. This makes it easier for us to analyse information. Additional sub-categories such as “Traveller” or “Romany/Gypsy” have been included as a result of past research in Worcestershire about how people like to describe themselves. You can mark more than one box in this section if you want to.  What will we do with the information?  The information will only be used to monitor services and employment. It will not be used to identify you, and no one will contact you because of the answers you give.  All the information will be stored securely in line with the Data Protection Act 1998. Your answers will only be retained for as long as is considered necessary for monitoring purposes and then they will be destroyed.  Do you have to answer the questions?  No, you don’t have to answer any question if you prefer not to. However as the results will be kept strictly confidential, and it may help us to improve our services, we would encourage you to answer as many questions as possible.
