Bonus and Pay Gap 
 
The table shows the overall mean and 
median gender pay gap based on hourly 
rates of pay at the snapshot date (5 April 
2017).  It also captures the mean and 
median difference between bonuses paid 
to men and women in the year up to 5 
April 2017, i.e. for the 2016 performance 
year. 
 

At the time of reporting Historic 
England had a total of 919 employees. 
 
Of these employees, 892 are counted 
as full pay equivalent employees – 
those who received a full month’s pay 
in April (i.e. not left part way through
 
the month, or did not receive a 
statutory payment throughout the
month).

Pay Quartiles
 
 

The above images illustrate the gender distribution at Historic England across four quartiles, each 
containing 223 members of staff.  The data confirms that men are under-represented and women 
over-represented in the lower pay quartiles; however, in Quartiles 1 and 2 distribution between men 
and women is more consistent, although there are slightly more men than women. 

We have created a comprehensive action plan which we are communicating to our people to 
highlight to them the areas we are working on which demonstrates we are committed to reducing 
our gender pay gap.
