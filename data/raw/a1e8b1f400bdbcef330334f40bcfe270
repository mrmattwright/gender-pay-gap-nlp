The mean is the average hourly rate of pay (or bonus 
pay paid during the relevant period) for all staff. 

The median is the middle value when the hourly 
rates of pay of all staff (or bonus payments paid in 
the relevant period to all relevant staff) are listed in 
numerical order.

By identifying the wage of the middle earner, the 
median is a good representation of the ‘typical’ gender 
difference - the difference in median pay at AJ Bell is 
low compared to most financial services companies.

Our mean gender pay and bonus gap figures are in 
common with most financial service companies and 
reflect the gender profile of our work force and the 
higher number of men in senior roles than women.

We are confident that men and women are paid equally 
for doing equivalent jobs across our business, and that 
our pay gap is driven primarily by the structure of our 
workforce at a senior executive level, the composition 
of which has been stable for several years.

In keeping with our Guiding Principles, we will continue 
to evaluate the effectiveness of our HR practices so 
that we do not disadvantage anyone. In particular, 
in relation to how we attract, select and develop our 
staff ensuring they have the support that they need to 
realise their potential at AJ Bell.
