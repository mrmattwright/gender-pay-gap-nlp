Gender Pay Gap  

REPORT 2018

P2

Overview

Under new legislation, UK employers with more than 250
employees are required to publish their gender pay gap. The data
Warner Music UK (WMUK) shares here recognises the required
snapshot date of 5th April 2017. We support the transparency
of the annual reporting requirement and, to that end, have also
voluntarily included data from January 2018.

Our current gender pay gap numbers make starkly clear the need
for us to accelerate the pace of change within our company. For
the past three years, we’ve been focused on making WMUK a
more dynamic and forward-thinking organisation. While we’ve
made real progress in many different areas, we’re acutely aware
there’s still much more work to do, especially if we are to be as
diverse and inclusive as we aspire to be and if we are to increase
the number of women in leadership roles.

Our pay gap is not an equal pay issue. For us,
‘equal pay for equal work’ is a fundamental principle, just as it’s,
rightly, a legal requirement. For the avoidance of doubt, Warner
Music UK is confident that it adheres with the equal pay criteria set
out in 2010’s Equality Act.

Our median gender pay gap, at 21%, sits slightly over the UK
national average* but our larger mean gender pay gap is
influenced by the imbalance of men and women in our senior
leadership roles. Within these roles, both pay and bonus are
heavily linked to the delivery of commercial performance, and
therefore show greater variance than at other levels of our
business. We’re attracting more women than men in more junior
positions, but we’re not seeing enough of them progress through
the organisation to the highest paid, leadership roles.

Rectifying this trend is an urgent priority. We continue to look
forensically across our entire company, from many different
perspectives, to activate the right Diversity & Inclusion strategies
and to ensure mindful action is happening every day. Meaningful
and sustained change will take time, serious investment and
consistent focus. We’re comitted to making the right changes and
working towards closing this gap.

Why Do We Have A Gender Pay Gap?

Analysis demonstrates that our gender pay gap is 
driven by the imbalance of men and women in our 
senior leadership and highly paid specialist roles. 
While women occupy 42% of all roles, just over 16% 
sit in senior management or leadership positions.

In terms of bonus participation, all of our permanent 
employees are eligible for our company bonus 
scheme. 

However, eligibility each year is determined by an 
individual’s start date - new employees starting on 
the 1st July or later are not eligible for a bonus until 
the following financial year. The disparity in male 
and female bonus participation indicates that more 
female employees joined after this threshold date.

How Are We Closing The Gap?
Our senior management team’s commitment to 
delivering long-lasting and meaningful change is 
profound. However, we recognise that achieving 
this goal is only possible if we’re engaging people 
at all levels of our company.

To that end, we’ve created 
employee-led working groups -  
 
our Diversity Taskforce as 
well as the more recently 
formed Women and 
Parenting Networks. 

this summer and the results will act 
as a guide to help prioritise  
our solutions. 

Our current focus lies in 3 key 
pillars, aimed at improving diversity 
and inclusion throughout the 
organisation. These are:

These groups have a mandate to 
propose and enact transformational 
programmes and events, as well as 
shape our Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy and future initiatives.

While the gender pay gap analysis 
has helped pinpoint areas for 
improvement, additional insight is 
necessary if we’re to successfully 
break down any and all barriers to 
gender equality. An extensive, global 
employee survey will be launched 

Refining Our Policies,  
Improving Our Recruitment  
and Developing Our People

Within these, some initiatives 
and working groups are more 
established than others. Yet 
collectively, they are already 
having a significant impact on our 
business, acting as the bedrock 
for our long-term Diversity and 
Inclusion strategy.

A company with real diversity and equality among its people 

and its leadership is a healthier, happier, more successful 

business. We will continue to invest heavily in 

sustained action, broader learning and greater awareness  

at every level of our company in order to close our gender 

pay gap and to create an inclusive culture.

1.  Refining Our Policies

EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT
• 

 We’ve launched a new version of our 
Code of Conduct, detailing our individual 
and collective responsibility to maintain 
a welcoming, professional and inclusive 
work environment. 

• 

In addition to regular online education, 
every employee within our UK company  
will undergo thorough, in-person training  
on our Code.

MATERNITY/PATERNITY POLICY 
• 

 WMUK is below the national average when 
it comes to the percentage of mothers 
returning to work. This has impacted the 
make-up of our leadership teams and the 
numbers of our existing female talent.  

•  As a result, we’re implementing a revised 

parental leave approach, offering enhanced 
and equal benefits to both parents.  

•  Through more flexible working options, 
additional mentorship and support with 
childcare, we will make it more attractive 
for people to remain at WMUK after having 
children.

COMPENSATION & BENEFITS
• 

 Our bi-annual salary and benefits reviews 
will continue to be informed by additional 
third-party data from an independent Human 
Resources consultancy. 

•  This provides added objectivity to our 
decision-making process, and helps us 
better understand employee expectations 
and industry norms.

Improving Our Recruitment

ADDRESSING UNCONSCIOUS BIAS
• 

 We believe individual training is crucial to 
attract and retain candidates from more 
diverse backgrounds.  

•  Our senior management, as well as their 

entire teams, will all join workshops around 
Unconscious Bias; to understand and 
dismantle the stereotypes that affect our 
individual and collective behaviours.

MORE DIVERSE CANDIDATE POOLS  
• 

 We’re increasing our chances of engaging a 
more diverse candidate pool. This includes 
our use of the augmented platform, Textio, 
which allows us to create job descriptions 
that are gender neutral to attract more 
diverse talent. 

• 

In particular, we’re already seeing a 
significant impact in the recruitment for our 
early career roles, with a greater breadth 
of candidates, leading to a more balanced 
intake of women.

Recruitment figures for 2017 
demonstrate a more gender 
balanced intake:

3.  Developing Our People

BESPOKE INDIVIDUAL TRAINING
In 2014, we launched a new, sophisticated suite 
of personal and professional training pro-
grammes designed to enhance career develop-
ment at all levels of the organisation:  

•  Mix and Master offers a range of bespoke 
programmes and initiatives, ranging from 
Power Chords (a set of business acumen 
workshops), to Next Note (which teaches 
management skills), to Sound Judgement 
(which covers ‘soft skills’ such as creative 
thinking and problem solving). This structural 
training helps to build the skills needed for 
career progression. 

•  Since its inception, we estimate that our 

Mix and Master programmes have already 
reached 75% of our female employees  
at WMUK.  

•  Top Line is an annual, year-long leadership 

development programme for our senior 
executives, designed to grow, strengthen, 
and refine leadership skills and to support 
our succession planning process. In the 9 
months from April 2017 to January 2018, 
we have seen a +19% change in our female 
leadership at WMUK.

FEMALE MENTORING SCHEME 

• 

In 2017, we began a female mentoring 
scheme, which draws on expertise from 
across the company, to support the ongoing 
development of our female employees and 
to identify future leaders.  

•  Our Mentee Alumni are continuing to 

participate in the programme as mentors for  
our internship intake this summer.

Our Future

There is a pressing need and desire for accelerated change
at Warner Music UK. We know that building an inclusive,
diverse culture is not only a moral imperative, it’s integral to our
commercial and creative success.

We’re deeply committed to truly empowering all our people to
reach their full potential, regardless of their identity or background;
to work in a safe, supportive and inclusive environment; and to be
fairly rewarded and recognised for their work.

Over time, as we strengthen and expand the measures laid out in
this document, the diversity of both our leadership teams and
our entire organisation will more accurately reflect our company
values, as well as the breadth and depth of our roster of artists and
their many and varied global audiences.
