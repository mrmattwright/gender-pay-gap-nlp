Report 2018 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 

The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, introduced 
gender pay reporting legislation, which requires employers with 250 or more employees to 
publish statutory calculations every year identifying the pay gap between male and female 
employees.  The Trust mirrors the gender profile of the NHS, as detailed in Appendix 1. 
 
There are two sets of regulations.  The first is for private and the voluntary sectors, with an 
effective date of 5 April 2017.  The Public Sector regulations are effective from 31 March 
2017, with a requirement for the gender pay gap information to be published on both the 
Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust website and the government website 
by 31 March 2018 for the reporting period of 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017.  There are six 
indicators which are required to be published. 
 
The gender pay gap is different to equal pay.  Equal pay relates to the differences between 
individuals or groups performing the same or similar work.  It is unlawful to pay people 
unequally because of their gender.   
 
Gender pay gap has a focus on the differences between the average earnings for all men 
and all women within the workforce, regardless of their level or role within the organisation.   
 
A wider definition of who counts as an employee is used here (from the Equality Act 2010). 
This means that workers are included, as well as some self-employed people. Agency 
workers are included, but counted by the agency providing them. 
 
Under the Equality Act, an employer may take what the law terms “positive action” to help 
employees or job applicants if certain criteria is met and evidence available and it believes: 
 

•  They are at a disadvantage because of their sex, and/or 
•  Are under-represented in the organisation, or whose participation in the organisation 

is disproportionately low, because of their sex and/or 

•  Have specific needs connected to their sex 

 
Gender Pay Indicators 
There are six calculations to be undertaken with the results being published on the Trust’s 
website and a government website within 12 months. 
 
An employer must publish six calculations showing their: 

•  Average gender pay gap as a mean average 
•  Average gender pay gap as a median average 
•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average 
•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average 
•  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a 

bonus payment 

to highest pay 

•  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest 

 
Identification of Pay Levels 
There are national terms and conditions of service for NHS staff, including pay.  The terms 
and conditions of employment vary for the medical workforce, however, the pay structures 
remain at the nationally agreed rates.  Local pay is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee for very senior managers. 
 

Where roles fall within the national Agenda for Change terms and conditions of employment, 
Colchester Hospital University NHS Trust has a job evaluation programme, which enables 
jobs to be matched to national profiles and enables the Trust to evaluate jobs locally, 
resulting in an allocation of Agenda for Change pay band to each role. 
 
Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust Gender Pay Gap Indicators 
 
Data is required to be submitted to 1 decimal point.  For differences in rates of pay and 
bonuses, a positive percentage indicates that men in the Trust receive a higher rate than 
women in the Trust.  Bonus pay for this purpose relates to Clinical Excellence Awards for 
medical staff.  Each part-time worker counts as one employee for gender pay reporting 
purposes.

Next Steps 
A more detailed analysis by staff group and division will take place to inform a Gender Pay 
Gap action plan.  The action plan should be developed with managers, colleagues and trade 
union representatives, with clear timescales and monitoring and evaluation included.  The 
action plan will: 
 

•  Communicate to existing staff that the Trust is committed to building a diverse and 
inclusive workplace, that gives equal opportunities to all employees irrespective of 
gender 

•  Assist in monitoring pay, bonus and career progression among staff to ensure that all 

employees, irrespective of gender are supported to reach their full potential on the 
basis of skill development, patient experience and high performance. 

•  Be available to potential applicants, which may attract a wider pool of talented people 

for vacancies, helping the Trust to recruit the best possible candidates; 

•  Provide a positive message to report in subsequent gender pay reporting statements, 
which is particularly useful if some of the measures identified may take some time to 
be implemented and effective. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix 1:  Our workforce Gender Profile 

 
The workforce at CHUFT is similar to the overall NHS workforce gender profile.  There are 
some areas where there are predominantly more of one gender, however, a key priority is 
ensuring that colleagues are not disadvantaged due to their gender. 
 
The Diversity Champion programme is an area of development, which has included the 
launch of additional support to LGBT colleagues.
