Dover Harbour Board staff participate in an individual performance-related bonus scheme based on 
the company’s financial targets (EBITDA) and personal performance through the setting of SMART 
objectives and behaviours measured against the Behaviour Framework.  All such performance award 
payments paid in the 12 months to 5 April 2017 have been used in the report.

All Dover Harbour Board staff are eligible to join the discretionary Bonus Scheme, provided they meet 
the criteria of being employed by 1 February and continue to be in employment on 31 December of 
each Scheme year.  Fewer women were eligible to join in 2017 as there was a higher percentage of 
female staff members who joined the organisation after 1 February or who had left before 31 
December.

The pay gaps identified are a reflection of the demographics of Dover Harbour Board and the overall 
under-representation of women in specialist professional roles, which attract a higher salary within 
the organisation. This is also very much reflective of the lack of females generally in both the 
marine/port and engineering industries.

We are addressing this issue by “growing” our own talent through apprenticeships, bursaries and 
graduate placements, as well as working with schools, colleges and universities to encourage women 
into these traditionally male-dominated occupations. In addition, we ensure that all of our policies, 
practices and processes are fair and free from bias, with recruitment practices aimed at attracting and 
retaining the best person for the job regardless of gender.
