Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

At HEINEKEN our ambition is to be Britain’s leading Pub, Cider and Beer Company, led and 
delivered by our passionate and inspired colleagues. We believe in equal opportunities for 
everyone and are focussed on our commitment to being an inclusive and diverse employer 
in every sense – from how we make hiring choices, to the conversations we have, and the 
decisions we make. This will ensure we reflect our diverse range of customers, consumers 
and communities in which we operate.

It’s important we continue to challenge ourselves to be more inclusive and diverse. This 
report details HEINEKEN UK’s gender pay gaps and identifies the main reasons behind 
them.  It also outlines our future plans for ensuring that HEINEKEN UK is a fully inclusive, 
diverse and engaging place to work.

Best wishes

David Forde
Managing Director, HEINEKEN UK

Inclusion and diversity 
are core to our culture at

started to take steps to close 
our gender pay gap, attract 
colleagues from a broader 
range of backgrounds and 
experience, and to make our 
business truly inclusive and 
a place where everyone feels 
they belong.

What is the gender pay gap and how is it calculated?

The UK Government’s new Gender Pay Gap Regulations require companies to report their gender pay gap for all legal entities in Great Britain with more than 250 employees, with 
the aim of creating transparency and encouraging employers to explore any gender pay gaps revealed by the process.

The gender pay gap shows the difference in average pay between women and men. It’s different to equal pay, which relates to what women and men are paid for the same 
or similar jobs or work of equal value.

Median 
hourly 
pay gap

The mean gender pay gap is the percentage difference between the hourly pay 
of all male employees divided by the total number of males, and the hourly pay 
of all female employees divided by the total number of females.  

If all female colleagues were lined up in order of hourly pay and all male 
colleagues were also lined up in order of hourly pay, the median pay gap is the 
percentage difference between the hourly pay of the middle female and the 
hourly pay of the middle male.

Why the difference?
Because different jobs pay differently and the number of men and women performing these jobs varies, a gender pay gap can exist. For example if there is a higher proportion of 
men in senior roles and/or a higher proportion of women in junior roles the gender pay gap will be bigger. 
Why is gender pay gap reporting important?
Gender pay gap reporting is an important step forward in putting a spotlight on where companies may have gender imbalances within their workforce, to assist them in 
understanding what’s driving it and importantly, what to do to improve it.

 % of colleagues overall

We have over 2,000 colleagues working at 
HEINEKEN UK across our breweries, sales teams 
and support functions. 

Our gender pay gap is influenced by three factors

Our breweries make up the largest 

proportion of our workforce, where the 
proportion of male colleagues is 90%.

Male colleagues make up a larger proportion 
of our sales organisation, and sales roles tend 

to attract higher levels of bonus. 

Just over a quarter of our leadership 

population is female.

While some of these factors are consistent with demographics in the manufacturing and FMCG sectors, we recognise we need to explore the gender pay gap as part of our 
commitment to being an inclusive and diverse employer. Turn the page to find out what we’re doing to close the gap.

Remember the gender pay gap is different to equal pay, which relates to what women and men are paid for the same or similar jobs or work of equal value.

What are we doing to close the gap?

Inclusion and diversity are core to our culture at HEINEKEN. We’ve already started to take steps to close our gender pay gap, attract colleagues from a broader range of 
backgrounds and experience, and to make our business truly inclusive and a place where everyone feels they belong.

Creating Awareness & Dialogue
Dedicated time will be spent with each of our Leadership teams 
to talk about what Inclusion & Diversity actually means and 
why it’s important to the success of our business.

HEINEKEN Inclusion Network 
This will drive change as we progress towards our ambition 
of total inclusivity. Colleague representatives from across all 
functions and levels will scope out our 2018 agenda, and agree 
the strategic objectives we will work towards. 

Identifying & Removing Bias 
We’ve started to assess our internal processes to ensure 
consistency across the whole business. We’ll continue to review 
how we recruit and reward people (within the organisation and 
externally), starting with how we advertise, how we screen CVs 
and how we assess candidates before welcoming them into our 
business. We aim to broaden that review across all our people 
processes in 2018. 

Inclusive Leaders & Diversity Commitments 
Our ambition is to create inclusive leaders in every sense, by 
setting clear expectations of them to role model inclusive 
behaviours. Leadership teams will build an Inclusion & Diversity 
commitment into their functional people plans in 2018.
