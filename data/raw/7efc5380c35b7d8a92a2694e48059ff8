Internal stakeholders  AVEVA is a diverse organisation with employees in 30 countries and from many different cultures. Our Global Ambassador Network continues to expand and provides a channel for our employees to provide feedback to the senior management team.Editorial teams manage the network’s regional communications to ensure our largest regions receive both corporate and regionally focused updates regularly,to support our employees in their roles.As of 31 March 2016 we have a headcount of 1,706, a 5% increase on last year (2015– 1,623). 75% of our employees are male and 25% are female (2015 – 73% and 27%).    External stakeholders  Transparency and disclosure is fundamental to our relationship with customers and suppliers and we continue to maintain open, honest and fair discussions to maintain our reputation as a trusted and ethical organisation.  To protect the interest of our customers,our Anti-Piracy and Compliance teams monitor the illegal use of AVEVA software and enforce compliance within our terms and conditions. This team has been expanded over the past two years in order to tackle the increased use of illegal software. AVEVA will continue to invest in both people and technology to further ensure compliant use of its technology. Whilst illegal use of our software is an ongoing challenge, AVEVA is becoming much more successful in the detection of such cases and the subsequent enforcement of licence terms.  To embed and reinforce our corporate policy against the acceptance or payment of bribes we have enhanced and improved our eLearning tools.Every employee completes the Global Corporate Governance and Group IT Compliance training each year to ensure that we maintain our high ethical standards. We review monthly operational challenges in the key regional hubs to ensure local governance.   Employee engagement  During September 2015 we carried out ‘Pulse’ engagement surveys in five key locations.Out of the total 654 employees who were invited to participate we achieved a 78% response rate and the overall score for engagement was 82%.  Where there were areas highlighted that showed improvement was necessary, action plans were developed and implemented.  Managers play a critical role in engagement and we continue to invest to support our senior management team. An example of this has been the development of a specific ‘Managers’Zone’ on our corporate intranet which hosts a range of materials, information and tool kits for managers, to support the mas they communicate with and develop their teams. The Executive Team holds manager briefings on key issues affecting employees, providing updates along with an open forum for questions and answers.   Communications  Keeping employees informed of business priorities and changes remains a key focus within AVEVA. As a global organisation,it is important that everyone feels part of AVEVA and that we share information across all teams and regions. Regular internal communication campaigns help to achieve this – through people stories,successes and competitions, our aim is to be inclusive and to celebrate our diversity.  Engagement levels remain high and we use feedback from our Global Ambassador Network to continue to improve and develop information that both informs and motivates our employees.   Learning and development  Our well established learning and development programmes continue to provide a range of opportunities for our current employees. This includes on-line language studies, technical development and management & leadership programmes.  To support our ambition to attract and nurture young, talented people we continue, through our apprenticeship schemes, work experience and as members of specific science and engineering groups, to encourage young people to start their careers with us.  Last year we saw:   2,166 hours of technical training(PluraSight) completed  2,671 hours of classroom training  44 colleagues completing Management Development  254 hours of AVEVA eLearning completed   AVEVA in the Community  We are proud of our AVEVA colleagues who continue to support many local, national and international charities. We match the funding raised by employees who have participated in various events,such as marathons, charity auctions,events, and fun runs. This year AVEVA has matched a total of £59,473 to support local communities. One of the many fine examples of the fantastic support that our teams have given during the course of the year comes from our team in Japan, who wanted to provide support to the growing number of refugees who find themselves in difficult situations. The team took part in a charity initiative to donate their used clothes to help raise funds through a Japanese clothing retail chain.  The chain have been donating clothing to many vulnerable groups in the region: evacuees, victims of disaster, expectant and nursing mothers, as well as others in need across the globe. The team collected a vast amount of clothing and are looking to continue to support this charity in such a simple but effective way to make a difference to people’s lives.     Carbon emissions  AVEVA is committed to minimising its carbon emissions, increasing the use of recycling opportunities and reducing the use of valuable natural resources. We are continually improving the way in which we capture and record our emissions data.  For the purpose of this report, the emissions have been calculated according to the ‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance’ issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and by applying DEFRA’s Conversion Factors. We have aimed for the GHG emissions to be captured for all of our UK and overseas offices between April 2014 and March 2015.  On the rare occasion that the information was not available for a particular AVEVA office, an estimate has been produced based on the ratio between the local office size, and our Cambridge HQ office.  This is the second year in which we have collected and published our emissions data, with the 2013/14 financial year serving as the baseline for our targets. For our carbon intensity ratio we have measured our carbon usage as it relates to our business performance, citing tonnes of CO2e/£ million of revenue. In 2014/15 this intensity ratio increased to 10.36 tonnes CO2e/£ million (2014 – 8.74). This increase partly reflects the reduction in our revenue during the year as well as the increase in our headcount.
