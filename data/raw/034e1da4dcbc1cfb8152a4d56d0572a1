Gender Pay Gap reporting 

Background  

  The  Equality  Act  2010  (Specific  Duties  and  Public  Authorities)  Regulations  2017 
requires employers to report their gender pay gaps for any year where they have a 
headcount  of  250  or  more  employees  with  effect  from  31  March  2017.  The  first 
publication will be for the following year.  

  Gender pay reporting is a different requirement to carrying out an equal pay audit.  
  Employers must identify who needs to be included in the report.  
  There  are  six  calculations  to  carry  out,  and  the  results  must  be  published  on  the 
Trust's  website  and  a  government  website  within  12  months  (March  2018).  Where 
applicable,  they  must  be  confirmed  by  an  appropriate  person,  such  as  a  chief 
executive or someone with delegated responsibility.  

  Employers have the option to provide a narrative with their calculations. This should 
generally  explain  the  reasons for the results  and  give  details  about  actions  that  are 
being taken to reduce or eliminate the gender pay gap.  

  While the regulations for the public, private and voluntary sectors are near identical, 
and the calculations are directly comparable, the public sector regulations also take 
into account the public sector equality duty.  

It is a legal requirement for all relevant employers to publish their gender pay report. Failing 
to do this within one year of the snapshot date is unlawful.  

The Equality and Human Rights Commission has the power to enforce any failure to comply 
with the regulations.

1.0 Introduction  

Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish 
statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and 
female employees.  

Reporting may show, for example, that on average men earn 10% more pay per  hour than 
women,  that men  earn 5%  more  in  bonuses  per  year  than  women,  or  that  the  lowest  paid 
quarter of the workforce is mostly female. These results must be published on the employers 
own  website  and  a  government  site.  This  means  that  the  gender  pay  gap  will  be  publicly 
available to stakeholders, employees and potential future recruits.  

As  a  result,  employers  should  consider  taking  new  or  faster  actions  to  reduce  or  eliminate 
their gender pay gaps.  

There  are  two  sets  of  regulations.  The  first  is  mainly  for  the  private  and  voluntary  sectors 
(taking effect from 5 April 2017) and the second is mainly for the public sector (taking effect 
from 31 March 2017). Employers will have up to 12 months to publish their gender pay gaps.  

2.0 What employees count?  

For  the  purposes  of  gender  pay  reporting,  the  definition  of  who  counts  as  an  employee  is 
defined in the Equality Act 2010. This is known as an ‘extended’ definition which includes:  

  employees (those with a contract of employment)  
  workers and agency workers (those with a contract to do work or provide services)  
  some self-employed people (where they have to personally perform the work)  

For  the  purpose  of  the  gender  pay  gap  reporting,  Agency  workers  will  form  part  of  the 
headcount of the agency that provides them, and not the employer they are on assignment 
to.  

2.1 Gender pay reporting and gender identity  

It is important for employers to be sensitive to how an employee chooses to self-identify in 
terms  of  their  gender.  The  regulations  do  not  define  the  terms  ‘male’  and  ‘female’  and  the 
requirement  to  report  gender  pay  should  not  result  in  employees  being  singled  out  and 
questioned about their gender.  

  As  a  starting  point,  most  employers  should  be  able  to  base  reports  on  the  gender 

identification the employee has provided, if such records are regularly updated.  

  Where  this  information  is  not  available  or  may  be  unreliable,  employers  should 
establish  a  method  which  enables  all  employees  to  confirm  or  update  their  gender. 
This  can  be  handled  early  and  proactively  when  informing  employees  that  gender 
pay  reporting  is  taking  place.  It  can  be  done  by  inviting  employees  to  check  their 
recorded gender, and update it if required.  
In  cases  where  the  employee  does  not  self-identify  as  either  gender,  an  employer 
may omit the individual from the calculations.

3.0 Gender Pay Reporting is different to Equal Pay  

Equal  pay  deals  with  the  pay  differences  between  men  and  women  who  carry  out  the 
same  jobs,  similar  jobs  or  work  of  equal  value.  It  is  unlawful  to  pay  people  unequally 
because they are a man or a woman.  

The  gender  pay  gap  shows  the  difference  in  the  average  pay  between  all  men  and 
women  in  a  workforce.  If  a  workforce  has  a  particularly  high  gender  pay  gap,  this  can 
indicate there may be a number of issues to deal  with,  and the individual calculations may 
help to identify what those issues are

•  The  average  hourly  rate  of  pay  is  calculated  from  a  specific  pay  period;  in  this  case  it  is 
March 2017. The hourly rate is calculated for each employee based on 'ordinary pay' which 
includes basic pay, allowances and shift premium pay.

•  As  an  NHS  organisation  the  only  pay  elements  we  have  that  fall  under  the  bonus  pay 
criteria  are  distinction  award  (Staff  grade  and  associate  specialist)  and  clinical  excellence 
awards (consultants) which are only applicable to certain groups of medical staff.  

•  The  percentage  variance  for  the  average  hourly  rate  of  pay  is  23%.  This  calculation  is 
based on the average hourly rate of 7199 female staff compared to 1482 male staff; because 
the  average  is  calculated  over  different  numbers  of  staff  (there  are  4  times  more  female 
staff), some variance is to be expected.  

• The percentage variance for the bonus hourly rate of pay is 4%. The pay elements that are 
used in this calculation are awarded as a result of recognition of excellent practice over and 
above  contractual  requirements  and  have  no  gender  bias.  As  such,  the  relevance  of  this 
indicator is less significant for our organisation.

Key Points:  

• In order to create the quartile information all staff are sorted by their hourly rate of pay, this 
list is then split into 4 equal parts (where possible).

•  When  reviewing  the  quartile  information  it  is  important  to  take  into  account  the  types  of 
roles  available  within  the  organisation  and  the  different  gender  splits  that  occur  within 
specific roles.  

• The highest variances for the quartiles when compared to the overall Trust value are in the 
lower and upper quartiles.  

• There is a higher proportion of female staff in the lower quartile; included in this quartile are 
admin & ancillary staff groups that have a higher proportion of female staff which is reflected 
in the calculation.  

•  The  lower  middle  and  upper  middle  quartiles  are  representative  of  the  Trust  as  a  whole 
with a less than 1% variance between the two quartiles.  

•  The  upper  quartile  has  a  higher  proportion  of  male  staff.  The  variance  in  this  quartile  is 
mainly due to significantly different gender splits in medical staffing and managerial roles in 
the  Trust,  this  is  countered  by  a  greater  proportion  of  female  staff  in  the  scientific  and 
nursing staff groups.

Key Points:  

 

This calculation expresses the number of staff receiving bonus pay as a percentage 

• 
of the total number of staff in each gender group.  
• 
Only  certain  medical  staff  receive  pay  that  is  classified  as  bonus  pay.  Bonus  pay 
elements  are  awarded  as  a  result  of  recognition  of  excellent  practice  over  and  above 
contractual requirements and can be awarded nationally and locally.   
 
Whilst the relevance of this indicator for our organisation as a whole is less significant 
as bonus pay applies to less than 2% percent of all staff employed it should be noted that  
proportionally more male than female doctors receive Clinical Excellence Awards and work 
needs to be undertaken to encourage and support female workers to apply for the awards.
