We aim to ensure fairness in all that we 
do, it’s a key value of ours and extends to 
all aspects of leading a business to great 
success through our most valued asset – 
our people. We are therefore committed 
to ensuring full compliance to the Equality 
Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap information) 
Regulations 2017, to ensure any gender 

pay imbalance that exists in our business is 
reduced accordingly. 
Our gender pay gap analysis considers six 
calculations that identify the differences 
between the average earnings of men 
and women in our organisation. These 
calculations include the mean gender 
pay gap, the median gender pay gap, the 
mean bonus gap, the median bonus gap, 
bonus proportions and quartile pay bands. 
The report does not involve publishing 
individual employee data and identities 
are fully protected in this regard. Results 
are published on both our own website 
and a designated government website and 
considers data for the period 6th April 2016 to 
5th April 2017.
It is important to remember that this report 
focuses on gender pay gaps, which is a 
measure between the average earnings 
of males and females within the business.  
It should not be confused with equal pay, 
which relates to equal pay for equal work 
between males and females.

The data here shows our overall difference in male and female employees 

as a total, identifying that males make up 60% of our overall workforce.

The fixed hourly pay is a calculation that considers 
the difference between the mean and median avg. 
hourly rate of pay of a male and female employee. 
The hourly rate of pay is based on 'ordinary pay' that 
includes basic pay, allowances (not expenses) and 
pay for leave, but excludes overtime pay, pay in lieu 
of leave, benefits in kind and any other payments 
referable to termination.  Ordinary pay is calculated 
before deductions are made i.e. tax and National 
Insurance, but after salary exchange i.e. pension.
The calculation for our fixed hourly rate of pay 
identifies that our male colleagues are paid on 
average 35% more than females per hour 
(mean average) and 28% more per hour (median).
The bonus paid calculation identifies the difference 
between the mean and median bonus pay which 
was paid to male and female colleagues between 6 
April 2016 and 5 April 2017.
The calculation for our bonus paid identifies that 
our male colleagues are paid on average 53% more 
bonus than females (mean average) and 51%  
(median).

We currently have a 1% difference between the number 
of men and women being awarded a bonus for their 
performance up to the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.

The above data helps to identify the proportion of each gender in equal 
quartile bands for April 2017, with each quartile containing 86 colleagues
(with the exception of the upper quartile, which contains 85 colleagues).

The AV industry is one that is historically 
renowned for having a higher male 
presence; for example, nearly 80% of our 
Twitter followers are male. Typically it is 
not common for females to enter into 
roles such as engineering or those which 
involve technical specialisms. The industry 
recognises this and there is increased 
activity around influencing and engaging 
women into the AV industry, for example, 
the introduction of the 'Tech she can 
charter' and women in AV (WAVE).
The results of our gender pay gap report 
have identified challenges, which will 
require focus to address our current 
gender pay gap, these being:
•  A higher proportion of males hold senior 

positions in our business.

•  A disparity in bonus payments across all 
quartiles, although not in equivalent roles.

Our initial analysis for lower and lower 
middle quartiles identify that we have a 
healthy balance between the number 
of males and females employed within 
these two sectors.  We do however, identify 
that the weighting of males vs females in 
the upper and upper middle quartiles is 
unbalanced, where we employ more males 
than females in our senior paid roles. We 
have reviewed our mean gender pay gap 
and mean gender bonus gap by pay 
quartile band and the gap is lower than 
the figures identified for the total gender 
pay gap, confirming that a key driver to 
our gap is the unequal population of males 
and females, particularly at a senior level. 

In addition, further analysis identifies that 
the bonus pay gap results do not take into 
account a number of factors which will 
naturally skew the results, these being:

•  Whether the employee is part time or full 
time and the effect of bonus values being 
paid on a pro rata level.  Our part time 
workforce is made up of females only.

•  The actual performance of an individual 
against target. We reward performance 
regardless of gender.
• 
Individual bonuses vs. team bonuses.
•  Actual bonus paid as opposed to the 

actual opportunity an individual has to 
earn a bonus.

•  An individual's length of service which 

will affect bonus payment criteria such as 
profit related pay.

We are a fast-paced business with 
ambitious plans for growth and we are 
delighted to work with our people to build 
a strong and fair business moving forward.  
Acquisitions have played a significant part 
in increasing our headcount, particularly 
through TUPE transfers. We accept that 
with these activity types, along with new 
locations for offices, there will be natural 
variances in pay, alongside terms and 
conditions of employment, which could 
contribute to ongoing gender pay gaps for 
us.  We will work hard to ensure we redress 
any imbalances that may arise in such 
circumstances and where appropriate.

We would never actively seek to discriminate in any activity we undertake and feel confident 
that any gender pay gap is not caused by males and females being paid differently where 
they are carrying out the same role under the same terms and conditions of employment.

We are always striving to ensure we operate fairly at Midwich and support the ongoing 
development of our people.  Encouraging improvements in diversity and inclusion and 
rectifying any gender pay imbalance is high on our priority list.

G E N D E R   P A Y   G A P
In light of the findings from the quartile 
analysis, we believe that if we focus our 
efforts on ensuring equal representation 
of genders at all levels, this will naturally 
reduce the gap we are experiencing.
We appreciate with an impressive 
retention record for some of our people, 
reaching well into 30+ years’ service, this 
naturally introduces a legacy of pay rises 
that may be out of sync with general 
market rates demanded for such roles.  In 
such circumstances it is not uncommon 
to freeze such levels of pay until the 
market / colleagues catch up.  
We acknowledge that office locations will 
play a significant part in varying hourly 
rates of pay, alongside any honoured 
payment terms following TUPE transfer 
processes.

G E N D E R   B O N U S   G A P
Overall, we believe there is a higher 
gender bonus gap because:
•  There are more males than females 
employed at a senior level and they 
tend to have the opportunity to earn 
much higher bonuses.

•  We have more part time female staff 

than male. The gender bonus gap 
does not recognise if an individual is 
working part or full time. In line with the 
snapshot data, 10% of female staff are 
part time and 0% of male staff are part 
time.

•  There is a higher proportion of females 

than males in roles which do not 
traditionally carry a significant bonus 
element.

We will continue to encourage flexibility in relation to how we work, an approach that 
has enabled us to retain some excellent talent by creating new roles where female 
staff have returned from maternity leave and they have not wished to return to their 
original full-time roles.

We will look to reduce our mean/median 
gender pay gap by focusing our efforts on 
equal representation of genders at all levels.

Midwich will continue to operate a 
‘best person for the job’ strategy when 
recruiting and this will be based on 
an individual’s experience, skill and 
knowledge. For every vacancy we have, 
candidates (whether already employed 
or new candidates) from any background 
have a fair and open invitation to apply, 
and it is important that we continue to 
adopt this method so that we have a pool 
of best candidates.

We are very proud with our proven track 
record of recruiting from within, nurturing 
our internal talent and encouraging an 
environment of succession planning.  
Throughout our business we can identity 
continuous success stories for both 
genders and this is something we will 
continue to do.

the job and retain the right talent in our
