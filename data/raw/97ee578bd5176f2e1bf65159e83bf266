       Gender pay gap report   We are required by law to publish details of our gender pay gap - this page brings you this year's gender pay gap report.              As well as providing a breakdown of the percentage of male and female employees in each layer of the organisation each year, the report provides details of our mean and median gender pay gap.  While our gender pay figures are healthy within our sector and in comparison to the national picture, we are focused on what we can do to improve gender equality, which will help attract people to work for us in the future.  We will use the information from our gender pay figures to develop a strategy to address our gender pay gap.  This will look at our equality, talent management, pay, reward, recruitment and retention processes and policies - the main aim will be to tackle the gender imbalances in our workforce where we have identified them.
