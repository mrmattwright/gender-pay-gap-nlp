consistency and transparency.

Understanding our Pay Gap
Our Company bonus policy 
is discretionary and is based 
upon individual performance 
related objectives and 
therefore not linked to basic 
salary payments.

We will continue to promote equality and 
inclusion at Accident Exchange and are 
committed to reducing any existing gender 
pay gaps year on year.

I confirm the data in this report is accurate.
