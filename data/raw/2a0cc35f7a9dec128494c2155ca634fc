Our Wigan Services have been rated 'good' by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).    In March 2016, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), published its report into the care provided by our Wigan Service.  The inspection team spoke to 6 people who receive support from us and 13 staff, including managers and support workers.  The inspection found the service was safe, effective, caring, responsive and well- led.  One person receiving support told inspectors  "I feel safe here. The staff support me with everything".  Another person said "The staff are friendly and caring."  A staff member told the inspector "I feel really well supported. I think the training is very effective and is related to the job role. As a support worker, I was supported to undertake training to support career progression to prepare me to become a team leader."  To have been rated as "Good" is not only great news for us, our staff but also for all of our customers, their families and our partners.
