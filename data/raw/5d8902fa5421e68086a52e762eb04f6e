The data published below represents Liverpool Football Club only. It does not include data for Liverpool Ladies Football Club or Liverpool FC Foundation as these are separate entities that do not employ over 250 people. The data relates to those paid by the club in the snapshot period of 5th April 2017, and includes players and casual workers.  In order to produce our gender pay data, we are required to carry out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in the Club:  1.            Mean gender pay gap  2.            Median gender pay gap  3.            Mean bonus gender pay gap  4.            Median bonus gender pay gap  5.            Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  6.            Proportion of males and females in each quartile band  The mandatory data below represents all Liverpool FC staff, including players and casual workers. We have also provided voluntary data which uses the same calculations, but excludes players.        Mandatory Disclosure  (LFC Staff including players)    Voluntary Disclosure  (LFC Staff excluding players)     1.  77.51%  35.38%    2.  0.13%  0.00%    3.  95.52%  76.33%    4.  53.32%  49.99%    5.   Males 9.57%  Females 3.60%    Males 6.34%  Females 3.60%     6.   Upper Quartile  M61.24%  F38.76%    Upper Middle Quartile  M56.47%  F43.53%    Lower Middle Quartile  M49.14%  F50.86%    Lower Quartile  M8.98%  F51.02%    Upper Quartile  M57.81%  F42.19%    Upper Middle Quartile  M57.38%  F42.62%    Lower Middle Quartile  M48.63%  F51.37%    Lower Quartile  M48.14%  F51.86%        It should be noted that our senior leadership team within football operations, including the first team manager, are all male which significantly contributes to the Club’s gender pay data.  We continue to work hard at attracting women to join the Club, but we do recognise that there is further work to be done to recruit more women in to senior positions. Our progress in the area of equality, diversity and inclusion has been recognised recently and, since this reporting date in April 2017, we are proud to be the first club to have been awarded the Premier League Equality Standard Advanced Level.  How we pay our people is also vitally important to us and we confirmed that all of our staff and casual workers will be paid the real living wage as a minimum from the start of our next financial year, June 2018.  Across all areas of the Club, we strongly believe that pay and reward should be linked to performance and merit and is not based solely on gender. We take these responsibilities seriously and are committed to increasing the diversity of our employees, while continuing to promote diversity and inclusion both to our employees and our supporters.  I confirm that this data is a true reflection of our gender pay as of the snapshot period of 5th April 2017.
