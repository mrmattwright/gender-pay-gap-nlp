HIX Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

Under  new  legislation  that  came  into 
force  in  April  2017,  UK  employers  with 
more than 250 employees are required to 
publish their gender pay gap.

This  is  not  the  same  as  equal  pay  as  it 
reflects  the  fact  different  proportions  of 
men and women work at different levels 
of the organisation.

Out of the total workforce 35% are women 
with the breakdown by quartile below.

Although we have more men than women 
employed at Hix, we have higher average
