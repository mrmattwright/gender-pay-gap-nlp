Construction as an industry has a traditionally male workforce, 79% of our workforce is male. This means that there are fewer women across the whole business, there are also fewer women in Senior Management positions.  As a group of companies, taking into account our property and distribution companies, our Gender Pay gap improves to 20% we feel this is more representative of the organisation. We welcome the requirement through Gender Pay reporting to become more transparent on our pay and recognise that we have work to do on addressing our gender pay gap.
