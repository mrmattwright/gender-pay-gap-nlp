The image above illustrates the gender distribution within 4 equally sized pay bands. 
Whilst we employ a greater number of women in each quartile, the 10% pay gap in the 
upper quartile reflects a higher proportion of men employed in more senior positions.

Declaration

We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across 
our business. We are committed to reducing our gender pay gap and providing greater 
opportunities for women to progress into senior positions. Our aim is to have women make 
up 50% of our senior leadership team by 2022.

I confirm that our data has been calculated according to the requirements of The Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
