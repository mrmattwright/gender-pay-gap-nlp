We welcome diversity, because we believe that a range of perspectives leads to innovation, an engaged workforce and better results for our customers.  Our people are critical to our success; they provide fantastic service to our customers and their drivers. Colleagues from all backgrounds are treated equally and everyone can contribute to our vision and goals. We encourage honest feedback from all our colleagues through a variety of means. As an employer we benchmark ourselves against the best, and are proud to be in the Sunday Times Best Company Top 100 for the second year running.  I am pleased that FMG has a lower median gap than UK average and I am confident that the gender pay gap at FMG is not as a result of equal pay issues. We have a consistent and gender-neutral approach to determining pay for roles at all levels, and our analysis shows that our gender pay gap is primarily caused by:   A high proportion of females in the workforce who work part-time. We see this as positive: We create roles with flexibility to attract a wide range of talent because full-time, 9-5 work patterns do not work for everyone. We are an employer committed to our local community, and to be successful we will need to create roles that are attractive to a wide range of talented individuals.  A greater proportion of males in senior & technical roles, which tend to be higher-paid. We have introduced a management development programme to offer development opportunities to managers, and those aspiring to manage others, which are aimed at colleagues from all backgrounds and gender. We are committed to creating career development pathways within FMG that are attractive to women in the Automotive Fleet Services and Insurance Claims Management sectors. In time, I expect this to lead to a higher proportion of women in senior and technical roles within FMG.   There is more to do, and we will continue to promote equality and diversity because we believe that by making FMG a great place to work, we will provide a great service to others.

FMG delivers a truly managed service with KPIs and a strong SLA.  Transparency – clients can access detailed real-time information about any aspect of their claim via the portal.  Significantly reduced claim life cycle – due to high value Delegated Authorities being in place with a number of insurers, claims need not touch the insurer. FMG’s in-house engineering capability means that a claim can be notified at 9am in the morning and repairs authorised the same day.  Improved control of overall claim cost – FMG don’t just control the Accident Damage cost, instead they focus upon the overall claim cost including Third Party Capture and proactive management of insurers.  Risk Management – in addition to the Claims Management service, FMG deliver a fully bespoke and in-house delivered Fleet Risk Management offering, Ingenium Dynamics.   These are the things that make FMG’s provision stand out for LARK.    Richard Graham, Divisional Director, Corporate Claims Division, LARK (Group) Ltd       We’ve had lots of positive feedback from our clients on the great service they’ve received at a potentially stressful time. This is great news for us and reinforces that FMG are a trusted partner whom we can rely on to deliver our customer promise and ensure that we meet our clients’ specific service expectations.    Debbie MacMorran, Managing Director, Equine Rescue Service       The enthusiasm and dedication of FMG to create a solution to meet our requirements has been remarkable. What’s more, their implementation and management of that solution with their partners is highly commendable. The improvements in performance targets speak for themselves.    Gary Bacon, Head of Service, Highways England       The contract with FMG has allowed Police Scotland to offer a consistent Scheme across Scotland. The regular reviews that FMG carry out will ensure the best possible Scheme is provided to the public. We are very pleased with the first few months of the service and look forward to seeing it develop throughout the period of the contract.
