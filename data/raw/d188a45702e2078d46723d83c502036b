             Head Office Address: Zing Leisure Ltd, 4 Redwing Court, Romford, Essex, RM3 8QQ    Employee Communication: Gender Pay Gap Reporting   We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee&apos;s data.  1.	Mean gender pay gap = 7.3% 2.	Median gender pay gap = 0.0% 3.	Mean bonus gender pay gap = 23.2% 4.	Median bonus gender pay gap = 27.7% 5.	Proportion of bonus payments = Male 19.3%, Female 15.9% 6.	Proportion of males & females per Quartile band •	Upper Quartile = Male 55%, Female 45% •	Upper Middle Quartile = Male 45%, Female 55% •	Lower Middle Quartile = Male 47%, Female 53% •	Lower Quartile = Male 57%, Female 43%  We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. We will do this within one calendar year of April 5th 2017. We can use these results to assess: • the levels of gender equality in our workplace •   the balance of male and female employees at different levels •         how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.  The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap. Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing HR and payroll records. All employees can confirm and update their records if they choose to by contacting the Head Office Payroll Dept.
