GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 
2018

Oliver Kay FOREWORD

Oliver Kay has had an exciting year further developing the produce business into new revenue 
streams.      

Over the last four years revenues have grown by 94%  from £27.4m to £53.2m and with that, 
staff have grown by 60% to 255. This has led to a professionalisation of our Human Resources 
approach.  

We  now  pride  ourselves  on  our  diversity  and  inclusivity  and  have  been  actively  promoting 
women to positions of authority within the business. 

Our challenge is to make the lower quartile positions more attractive to women, something we 
are targeting ourselves to achieve in the coming years.

Oliver Kay OLIVER KAY: OUR GENDER PAY STATISTICS.

In line with the UK government’s new Gender Pay Gap regulation, our findings and analysis show the following:

UNDERSTANDING OUR 
GENDER PAY GAP
15% of Oliver Kay employees 
are women.  

The mean hourly rate is 0.69% 
lower than men and the median 
hourly rate 2.69% lower than 
men.

The bonus pay mean for women 
was 31.42% lower than men and 
the median was 35.21% lower 
than men. 

The bonus structure includes 
a series of incentives for staff 
to perform their roles on a 
consistent and regular basis.  

The positions that attract those 
bonuses are dominated by male 
employees.  The big challenge is 
to make the produce business 
more attractive to women in all 
the quartiles.
