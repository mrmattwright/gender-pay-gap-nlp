Gender pay report
2017

At Hiscox we want to employ and keep the best people, and provide 
them with the means and motivation to excel in their careers with us. 
It is why we benchmark salaries and provide performance-related 
bonuses, employee share schemes and competitive benefits to all 
our employees. And we strive to be inclusive, so that everyone 
working here can fulfil their talent and ambition.

Like many other businesses, Hiscox has a 50/50 gender split at 
entry level roles, but we see a decline in women filling senior, more 
higher-paid roles. This is driving a gap between the average amount 
paid to men, compared to the average amount paid to women.

As well as bringing transparency to the gender pay gap, this report  
also outlines what steps we are taking to support more women to 
reach senior positions at Hiscox.

The proportion of females receiving a bonus during the year was 87% versus 89% of men.

The UK Government has asked all firms with more than 250 employees to publish details 
of the gap in pay between men and women. Along with many other businesses this is the 
first time Hiscox has reported the average amount paid to men, compared to women. 

One thing to note is the difference between equal pay and gender pay. Equal pay is the 
amount paid for carrying out like-for-like roles. This report looks at the gender pay gap 
which the government defines as, “...an equality measure that shows the difference in 
average earnings between women and men.” 

As well as covering the gender pay gap, our report also looks at the gender gap in bonus 
payments and what we are doing to close the gap in both salary and bonuses by making 
sure more women have a better chance to progress to senior roles within Hiscox.

Hiscox’s overall gender pay gap
Our data was taken from the April 2017 pay period and 
converted to an hourly rate of pay for each employee regardless 
of their job role, level of seniority, or location. The average 
hourly pay for men and women was calculated on a mean  
and median basis.

While we know men and women employed at Hiscox are paid 
equally for carrying out equivalent jobs – we have a robust 
process in place to ensure pay levels are reviewed fairly and 
consistently – our analysis shows that the pay gap is largely 
due to having fewer women at senior levels.

This imbalance is shown in the chart to the right. They were 
created by ordering all employees, irrespective of gender, in 
terms of highest to lowest hourly pay. The data was then split 
into four equally-sized groupings with those in the highest paid 
grouping shown below in the upper quartile row, and those  
in the lowest paid grouping in the lower quartile row.

If you compare the lower quartile row – where the male/female 
split is equal – with the upper quartile where men make up 75% 
and women only 25%, then the under representation of women 
at senior levels is clear.

What’s the bonus pay gap
Turning to the difference in bonus pay between men and 
women, we took bonus payment data from the 12 months  
to 5 April 2017. We have not adjusted the amounts to reflect  
the impact of part-time working and temporary absence.

As with pay, since there is a higher representation of men 
at senior levels in the organisation in roles which attract higher 
variable pay; men’s bonuses are, on average, larger than 
women’s bonuses.

These figures also include share options exercised which  
can vary year to year, as timing is determined by employees.
The difference between the mean and median figures is 
primarily explained by the share transactions of a small  
number of male employees.

There is equal opportunity to earn a bonus at Hiscox.  
The proportion of females receiving a bonus during the  
year was 87% versus 89% of men (see charts below).

The slight difference for the current year of reporting is  
due to more women joining the company after the annual 
bonus eligibility cut-off date and not receiving a bonus.

Bridging the gender pay gap: what we’re doing about it
Our position is clear: we want more women in senior roles at Hiscox. To achieve that goal 
we need to help women build their careers through all levels in the organisation. To help us, 
the following initiatives are underway. We recognise it will take time for these initiatives to 
reduce our gender pay and bonus gaps but we are determined to make lasting changes.

Our initiatives

More flexible working
We have removed potential barriers to women’s career 
progression by enhancing our maternity and paternity 
packages, and encouraging flexible working. Working 
from home or part time should not be a barrier to  
career progression.

Peer support
In 2014 we launched a ‘women in leadership’  
programme to help women maximise their leadership 
potential. This initiative is being sponsored by the Hiscox 
Executive Committee.

Measuring our progress
Each Hiscox business unit has set its own diversity 
key performance indicators which are being monitored 
by Hiscox’s Chief Underwriting Officer. We have also 
appointed our first diversity and inclusion specialist.

Career development
Targeted development plans are in place to support 
career progression and help every woman at Hiscox  
fulfil their potential.

Gender neutral recruitment
Our recruitment processes have been reviewed to ensure 
they are gender neutral. We are taking steps to ensure 
we have a balanced shortlist of candidates for job roles 
which, historically in the financial services sector, have 
been dominated by men.

Supporting parents
We have a parents network and ‘return to work’ project  
for new parents. We’ve been looking at the data, hearing 
first-hand from employees and benchmarking to ensure 
best practice.
