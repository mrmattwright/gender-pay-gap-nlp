Our corporate strategy  We want to use our insights to re-focus medical regulation on supporting a high quality workforce in delivering good medical practice. Here’s how we intend to do that.      Corporate strategy                The impact of our work  Our work has positive impacts on patient safety and medical education and practice in many ways. We also work to make sure any negative impacts of our work are reduced. See some examples here.  Our impact  Where we are making a difference     Impact report  Reducing the stress connected to investigations  Sharing data with others to support workforce planning  Using mobile apps to make our standards more accessible              Business plans and reports         Business plans   Find out what we have set out to do this year to support our corporate strategy, and see our previous business plans.              Annual reports   We chart our progress on an annual basis and report on it in our annual reports.                  The General Medical Council  We help to protect patients and improve medical education and practice in the UK by setting standards for students and doctors. We support them in achieving and exceeding those standards, and take action when they are not met.
