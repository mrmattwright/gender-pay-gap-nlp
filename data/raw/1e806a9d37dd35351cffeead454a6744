Councils are required to publish data in CSV files, on a monthly basis, no later than 30 days after the month end. Details for our expenditure, by month, are available below.  From August 2012 we have chosen to publish details of all payments, not only those of £500 or more.  If you have any questions, please email them and the payment number to:   the Transparency team   This information is made available for use under the terms of the:   Open Government Licence for
