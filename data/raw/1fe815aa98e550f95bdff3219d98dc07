Introduction
This report sets out the gender pay gap for United Learning, explains the key causes 
of the gap and sets out our plans and aspirations to address it. 
United Learning is committed to fairness and equal treatment of all colleagues at 
work and we therefore view the gender pay gap with concern.  We recognise the 
value of this data in challenging us to examine our practice, to identify barriers or 
obstacles that we need to remove and to look for areas where we can improve.

What is the gender pay gap?
The gender pay gap is the difference in average earnings between men and women 
regardless  of  the  nature  of  their  work. This  is  a  broader  concept  than ‘equal  pay’ 
which means that men and women doing the same work or work of equivalent value 
must be paid the same.
The following shows the gender pay gap at United Learning at the ‘snapshot’ date 
(31st March 2017 for ULT and 5th April 2017 for UCST). The gap is largely due to 
proportionately more women working in less senior and part time support roles.

Bonus payments do not form a significant 
part of our pay and reward strategy and our 
distribution  of  bonuses  is  well  balanced. 
Consequently  our  focus  will  be  on  hourly 
pay, although we will continue to monitor 
and  provide  guidance  on  equitable 
application of bonuses.

Understanding the gender pay gap

73% of the gender pay gap can be attributed to four major components:

Progression – more women in leadership
What we currently do: comprehensive leadership and talent programmes, mentoring and 
professional development programmes to support development and progression of all 
staff. Positive female representation in senior roles (4 of 7 members of the Executive Team 
and 53% of headteachers are female) – though still below the proportion of women in 
our workforce.

The United Learning gap compares favourably to the 
national median gender pay gap of 18.4%.  While this 
reflects our commitment to equality and fairness, we remain dissatisfied and will work to 
reduce it further.  We recognise that societal and sectoral factors beyond the control of 
any single employer contribute to the gap and will look to work with others in education 
and beyond to play our part in tackling these problems.

annually and supported by additional equality guidance.
What we will do: Review our recruitment process and provide additional guidance on 
avoiding unconscious bias at both attraction and selection stages. Continue to develop 
our clear and competitive pay and reward strategy, in particular by launching our new 
pay structure for school support staff. Consider how to attract more men into primary 
education and into support staff roles.

Seniority  of  role  –  women  are  more  likely  to  be 
working in less senior roles

Type of role – our whole workforce is predominantly 
female, but the proportion of women in support roles 
is even higher than in teaching roles

Working  pattern  –  women  are  more  likely  to 
be  working  part  time  and  part  time  roles  are  more 
common in the lower pay quartiles

School  phase  –  women  are  more  likely  to  be  
working in the primary phase where average salaries 
tend to be lower

A residual gender pay gap of 3.8% is not attributable 
to  these  factors. A  number  of  factors  contribute  to 
this  residual  gap,  including  location  of  workplace, 
level of qualifications and experience, and additional 
responsibility taken alongside role. As part of our action 
plan we will be working to identify as far as possible 
any additional factors contributing to our gender pay 
gap so these can be appropriately addressed.

What  we  will  do:  review  our  current  leadership 
development and talent pipeline approaches, looking 
particularly  to  ensure  that  talented  women  are 
encouraged and supported to think of leadership roles 
from early in their career, that women are given the 
same  early  career  challenges  and  opportunities  as 
men,  that  leadership  roles  are  designed  to  be  open 
to women returning from maternity leave or seeking 
flexible working, and that we identify and eliminate 
as  far  as  possible  visible  and  invisible  obstacles  to 
women taking leadership positions.

Culture – more flexibility in the workplace
What we currently do: generous maternity, paternity 
and shared parental leave policies; good examples of 
flexible working including in some of our most senior 
roles.
What we will do: actively promote our family friendly 
policies  and  ensure  that  women  and  men  taking 
advantage of them are visibly valued, able to contribute 
and supported to return to work and progress in their 
careers; consider how best to extend flexible working 
in teaching roles and especially in more senior roles, 
carrying out specific work with schools to test and trial 
approaches to flexible working.

Employment Practices – inclusive recruitment 
and reward
What  we  currently  do:  Operate  consistent  and  best 
practice  recruitment  and  selection  policies  and 
provide training on their application. Our pay strategy 
is  competitive,  and  our  pay  policies  are  monitored
