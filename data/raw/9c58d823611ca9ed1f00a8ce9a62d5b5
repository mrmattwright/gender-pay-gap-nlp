2017 Gender pay gap report 

1.  Introduction and background 

This report has been prepared in line with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 

Information) Regulations 2017 and Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) 

Regulations 2017. These regulations require that charities with over 250 staff publish 

information on their Gender Pay Gap annually, both on the government website and on 

their own. This report outlines the data that was published on the government website as 

well as some additional narrative and benchmarking, in order to help us better understand 

what this means for us. 

The data is based on the number of people employed by us and what they were paid at the 
‘snapshot date’ of 5th April 2017. As at that date St Joseph’s Hospice had 343 employees all 
of whom were classed as ‘relevant employees’ for the purposes of reporting on bonus pay 

gap statistics. 281 were classed as ‘full pay relevant employees’ and were used in the 

reporting of hourly pay gap statistics.  

2.  Workforce composition and pay structures 

The gender breakdown of our workforce at the reporting date was 79% female and 21% 

male. This shows a higher proportion of females to males than is represented in the wider 

population, however given that St Joseph’s hospice is predominantly a clinical setting, our 

workforce percentages are broadly comparable with NHS workforce compositions of 77% 

females (Health and Social Care Information Centre – HSCIC – October 2013).  

The hospice mirrors agenda for change pay scales for the majority of staff (presently we 

mirror the 2016-17 payscales) with a job matching system in place which requires roles to 

be evaluated for pay through a fair and robust process.  A small number of staff receive spot 

salaries (5%), and a small number of medical staff directly employed by the hospice (2.3%) 
are paid in line with the NHS Pay and conditions circular for medical and dental staff.  

3.  St Joseph’s Hospice statistics 

The following table shows the data that has been uploaded onto the government website:

3.  Our mean gender bonus gap is 5.6% 

4.  Our median gender bonus gap is 0.0% 

5.  The percentage of:

However this data doesn’t tell us enough about our pay gap, what this means for us and 

how we compare so we have provided further analysis and benchmarking below. 

4.  Benchmarking and narrative 

The following analysis benchmarks St Joseph's Hospice data against benchmarks derived 

from participants in the XpertHR Gender Pay Gap Reporting Service: 

  Whole sample - all organisations 

 

Sector - organisations in the same broad sector – Charities/ Not for profit 

  Employees - organisations with a similar number of employees 

Additionally, our results have been benchmarked against data from the Office for National Statistics 

Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2017: 

  All organisations (UK average) 

  Organisations in our industry 

 

 

Our mean gender pay gap 

Our mean gender pay gap is 1.2%. This calculation shows the difference between the mean hourly 

rate of pay that male and female relevant employees receive. Our mean hourly rates of pay for each 

gender are shown below: 

  The mean male hourly rate of £14.89 

  The mean female hourly rate of £14.71

Summary 

At -17.1%, the median gender pay gap for St Joseph’s Hospice is significantly below the 

whole sample figure.  It is significantly below the figure for organisations in the same sector 

and significantly below organisations that have a similar number of employees. 

Note: A minus figure means that the female median rate is higher than the male median rate. This is 
likely to be due to the high proportion of females employed by the hospice (79% of workforce).

pay that male and female relevant employees receive. Our mean annual bonus rates of pay for each

employees in four quartile pay bands, which is done by dividing the workforce into four equal parts.

5.  Summary 

 

Overall the hospice does not appear to have a significant gender pay gap.  

The most significant variation relates to bonuses where the data suggests an adverse effect on 
females. However, it should be noted that the data used to calculate this represented a £25 
Christmas event payment which was paid to all staff. However only a small number of staff received 
this through the payroll (some received it through petty cash payment) which will have exaggerated 
the gap shown.  

The composition of our highest paid staff (band D of the quartile report) is comprised of 76.1% 
female and 23.9% male which sets us higher than the composition of high earners in other 
organisations in the sector (41.5% male and 58.5% female). This high percentage of female high 
earners also broadly mirrors the composition of the workforce at the hospice as a whole (79% 
female) and reflects the high number of females employed in clinical roles in the NHS workforce 
composition figures (77%). This gives reassurance that there is no ‘glass ceiling’ preventing females 
from entering into high paid positions at the hospice.  

This is the first year the hospice has been required to produce a gender pay gap report and therefore 
a trend analysis has not been possible this year. However, we will use this data to compare with next 
year’s data and continue to benchmark ourselves against other organisations within the sector as 
well as benchmarking against other hospices in future where possible.
