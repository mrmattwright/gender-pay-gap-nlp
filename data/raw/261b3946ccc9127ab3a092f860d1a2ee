History      Chinn family farming at Cobrey Farms dates back to 1925, when Wilfred Chinn took on the tenancy of just 125 acres from Guy’s Hospital. Wilfred’s son, Bill, managed the farm over 18 years, before his son John returned home from university to build the business we know today. Disaster struck in 2002 when fire consumed the potato and onion facilities, but we were undeterred and the site was redeveloped. Onion production ceased to make way for the, now hugely successful, asparagus enterprise. Two of John and Gay’s sons, Henry and Chris, joined the business in 2000 and 2007 respectively, and brought with them a wealth of experience in agriculture and engineering.            Our Team      We employ hundreds of people to join the Cobrey Farms team each season, and house many of them on-site. It is their hard work and skill that allows us to produce high volumes of premium crops.  As a family business, we take great care to provide a happy, healthy and safe working environment for our staff. We provide extensive training, and all of our employees are encouraged to develop their skills to progress within the company.  We take responsibility for ensuring the welfare of all our employees and believes everyone should be treated fairly.
