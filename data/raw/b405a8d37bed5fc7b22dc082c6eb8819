Our gender pay results - in both median and mean - are below those of both the UK retail and wider industries.  We report this information on an annual basis to our global organisation and in 2017 H&M was ranked number one on the LedBetter list ‘The gender equality index.’ Any difference highlighted by the report is not due to a disparity in pay between the women and men in our organisation but due to the structure of our workforce – 78% of our employees are female.  Supported by our salary benchmarking project we are continuing to identify and eradicate any known differences between genders working in the same role.  The H&M group is fully committed to treating all our employees equally, no matter what their gen­der, background, ethnicity or race and as such we believe that there should be no structural differences in compensation between genders.  The H&M group is fully dedicat­ed to an equal pay structure for all our employees.
