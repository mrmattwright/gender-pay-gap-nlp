We contribute to the Drinkaware Trust and support the work of The Portman Group on drinks labelling and advertising.  We also support the work of the Wine and Spirits Trade Association financially and with a member of the Executive team acting as a trustee.  Environment  Conviviality and its trading companies are leaders and innovators in environmental initiatives in the drinks business.  Bibendum was the first wine business to become ISO14001 compliant, an accreditation it shares today with Matthew Clark .  Conviviality is fully ESOS-compliant. Initiatives across the group have led to reduced electricity consumption in our depots, reduced emissions from our fleet and reduced waste and greater levels of waste collection and recycling.  Our businesses have been at the forefront of UK bottling in lighter weight bottles, reducing not only our own emissions, but those of the industry as a whole. Our fleet of vehicles are continually being replaced to meet the more stringent Euro 6 emissions standard and we use software to reduce idling times, over-revving and other sources of emissions. Across the Group we’re reducing waste too. We work with our Franchisees to collect waste and in our depots have invested in waste segregation and cardboard collection.  Charity  We believe our businesses and people play an important role in the communities where they trade.  All our businesses support charities and during the last year more than 20 charities benefited from fundraising by our people, with over £177,000 raised.  The Group works closely with Help for Heroes producing ‘Wine for Heroes’ raising over £25,000 as well as The Benevolent, the drinks trade charity and Springboard, a charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged young people and adults develop skills and access careers in the hospitality industry.  Employees  Conviviality employs 2,639 people and we are committed to providing our employees with rewarding roles and long term career opportunities.  Bibendum PLB Group was recently awarded Investors in People status and we will use the benefit of this award to support our people across the whole of Conviviality.  All our people, across all areas of the business, have clear targets aligned to driving our success. And when our people deliver their objectives and targets we reward them for the part they play. All Conviviality employees can join the bonus scheme and share scheme after six months’ employment.  Gender Pay Gap  As a listed business, we are required to share Gender Pay Gap reports for 4 of the legal arms of our business: Bargain Booze Ltd., Bibendum Wine Ltd., Conviviality Retail Logistics and Matthew Clark Wholesale Ltd.  The reports, which can be downloaded via the links below, are reflective of the situation across all 4 legal entities on a snapshot date of 5th April 2017. Our data has been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  At Conviviality, we are committed to equality and building a culture centred around inclusion and fairness. We are at the beginning of our journey as one combined business, and we recognise that gender equality and the Gender Pay Gap is a key issue to be addressed by the whole business. We have set ourselves some targets that span Conviviality and all our brands with the intention of progressing on the fronts of diversity, equality and inclusion whilst working to decrease the Gender Pay Gap together as a combined business.
