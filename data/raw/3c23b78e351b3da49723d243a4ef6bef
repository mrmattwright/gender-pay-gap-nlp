It captures any pay differences resulting from the sorts of jobs performed by men and women.  Whilst both equal pay and the gender pay gap deal with the difference in pay women and men receive in the workplace, they are two different issues. Equal pay is concerned with the difference in pay between men and women performing the same or similar work . Unequal pay is unlawful.  We have reported a mean gender pay gap of 13.7% ( 13.2% including RSC Enterprise, see below) and median gap of 13.1% ( 12.7% including RSCE).  Currently, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that across the UK the mean hourly pay of female employees is 17.4% lower than men’s (18.4% median). Most companies will report a gap this year. Although our gender pay gap figures are better than the national average, we want them to be better.  We want the RSC to be an equal, diverse and inclusive organisation, committed to equality of opportunity for everyone. Our figures, based on ’snapshot’ data on 5 April 2017, are largely driven by two factors, which together create the gender pay gap figure:   a higher proportion of men than women in higher paid roles  we mirror the national picture of more women working part-time than men, and most of our part-time employees are currently in lower earning roles   We are committed to reducing the gender pay gap and increasing gender equality.  Our action plan to achieve these objectives is focused on improving gender balance across all our teams, and on highlighting and developing more opportunities for part-time and flexible working at all levels in the Company.  In more detail  Legislation for gender pay gap reporting came into force on 6 April 2017. This requires all employers in Great Britain with 250 or more employees to publish information regarding their gender pay gap by 4 April every year.  The gender pay gap information uses data based on payroll information on 5 April each year – the ‘snapshot’ date. On 5 April 2017 there were 696 eligible employees for RSC and 154 for Enterprise. Although the regulations apply only to the main RSC charity (including Matilda The Musical in the UK) and not to RSC Enterprise, we have voluntarily added the information for Enterprise.  Companies are also required to show the percentages of men and women in each quartile, that is each quarter of the workforce. For us, there are 174 people in each of these quartiles. Whilst our total workforce is made up of 48% male and 52% female employees, and whilst we have more women than men in senior management positions, our pay quartiles show that men account for 59% of the upper pay quartile, whilst women account for 63% of the lower pay quartile.      Pay Quartile    Men    Women      Upper    59%    41%      Upper Middle    52%    48%      Lower Middle    43%    57%      Lower    37%    63%      These figures include employees in all our teams, including actors and musicians, for example. The figures show that we need to continue our progress towards gender balance across the whole Company .  Our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Plan (ED&I) underpins our commitment to achieve gender equality and greater gender balance across all our teams, with a focus on recruitment, diversity training, and further development of supportive working arrangements and policies. The gender pay gap results will be used to further refine our approach and will, over time, help us measure the impact of our plan.  Finally  You can see how we compare with other organisations, including those in our sector, at the Government’s website: https://gender-pay-ap.service.gov.uk/Viewing/search-results  We want to reduce our gender pay gap. This will happen by delivering the range of actions contained within our ED&I plan, as we become an ever more equal, diverse and inclusive organisation.
