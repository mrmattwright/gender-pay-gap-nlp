The David Ross Education Trust is required to publish information to demonstrate how large the pay 
gap is between our male and female colleagues, in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender 
Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, at our snapshot date of 31st March 2017. 

The Gender Pay Gap is defined as the difference between the mean and median hourly rates of pay 
of male and female employees. At the snapshot date, the Trust has a total of 1881 reportable 
employees, of which 389 (20.7%) are male and 1492 (79.3%) are female. Our Gender Pay Gap figures 
are as follows:

The majority of our male colleagues, 67.9% (264 in total), are in the upper and upper middle quartiles, 
whereas the majority, 54.7% (816 in total), of our female colleagues are in the lower and lower middle 
quartiles. Therefore, our mean and median Gender Pay Gap figures are significantly affected by our 
workforce distribution. 

The Trust remunerates our colleagues in one of several ways; using the Teaching and Leadership pay 
scales set in the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD), pay scales set by the National 
Joint Council for Local Government Services (NJC), and use of spot salaries based around these pay 
scales. 

The Trust is an equal opportunities employer, supporting the fair treatment of all of our colleagues 
irrespective of gender through our transparent recruitment, pay, and professional development 
processes. 

Supporting Statement 

I can confirm that the above information has been prepared from our payroll data from the snapshot 
date of 31st March 2017 and fairly represents the gender pay gap information for the David Ross 
Education Trust.
