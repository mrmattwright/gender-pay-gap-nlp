GENDER PAY GAP 
REPORT 2017

FOREWARD

Rona Chester
Chief Operating Officer

“

     At Sport England, we want our workforce to represent the diverse mix 
of backgrounds and identities in our society. Our vision is that everyone, 
regardless of their age, background or level of ability, feels able to engage 
in sport and physical activity. Similarly, we want our workforce to have the 
same opportunity to thrive. 

We want everyone to feel respected, valued and able to give their best whether they work on 
a part-time or full-time basis. This commitment is not only central to our values, it’s also critical 
to our long-term success, which is why we seek to work with people and organisations who 
reflect our equal opportunity values.

Sport England welcomes the introduction of Gender Pay Gap Reporting and what it sets 
out to achieve. We see it as a positive opportunity to increase our transparency of any pay 
challenge that we face and it’s an important step forward for equality. 

We’re committed to going beyond our requirements and this is demonstrated in publishing 
our gender pay gap figures on a voluntary basis, despite being below the current threshold 
for this year’s reporting requirements. 

At Sport England we have a mean gender pay gap of 6.4%, which is significantly lower than 
other similar organisations benchmarked. While not complacent, we’re pleased with our 
current position, which we believe is due to the strong foundations that we’ve already laid. 
Our long-term commitment to diversity, and in this instance, gender pay, is about maintaining 
a good gender profile, creating a supportive culture and achieving the aims of our wider 
Diversity Action Plan. There is still more that we can do to improve gender and diversity going 
forward. We are committed to making progress to build a diverse workforce.

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017THE GENDER PAY GAP IS DIFFERENT FROM EQUAL PAY 

Unequal pay is the unlawful practice of paying men and women 
differently for performing the same or similar work or work of value. 
The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the 
average hourly earnings of men and women. In keeping with equal 
pay, Sport England is committed to fostering a transparent and fair 
pay and reward scheme, underpinned by robust job evaluation. 
Running alongside this, we have bi-annual equal pay audits to check 
for gender bias and this is reported to our Board. 

LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
Public sector employers with 250 or more relevant employees are 
required to publish gender pay gap information by 30 March 2018, 
based on the following data from 31 March 2017:
 > Mean and median gender pay gap
 > Mean and median gender bonus gap – this information is excluded 
from our report as Sport England does not have a bonus scheme
 > Proportion of males and females by quartile pay band. 

BENCHMARKS
Sport England has used benchmarks so we can see how our gender 
pay gap compares with other similar organisations. Our data has been 
benchmarked against benchmarks derived from participants in the 
XpertHR Gender Pay Gap Reporting Service:
 > Sector: organisations in the same broad sector
 > Industry: organisations in the same industry
 > Employees: organisations with a similar number of employees.

Figures for each legal entity with at least 250 employees on the 
snapshot date (31 March 2017) must be calculated and reported 
separately:
 > The mean and median gender pay gap is based on hourly rates 
 > Pay quartiles look at the proportion of men and women in four pay 
 > The figures set out in this report have been calculated using the 
standard methodologies set out in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender 
Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017GENDER SPLIT OF SPORT ENGLAND EMPLOYEES 

We already have a balanced 
gender workforce with an 
almost equal split of men 
and women. 

WHAT IS OUR GENDER PAY GAP AT SPORT ENGLAND?

The mean gender pay gap for Sport England is 6.4% based on an average standard 
hourly rate of £25.38 (male) and £23.75 (female). This compares very well across the whole 
sample of organisations benchmarked and is significantly lower than organisations of a 
similar size and the charities/not for profit sector.

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017PROPORTION OF MALES AND FEMALES BY PAY QUARTILE

Of all the metrics, this is the one most 
likely to shed light on the underlying 
causes of any gender pay gap at Sport 
England. This section of the report 
divides the workforce into four equally 
sized groups based on their hourly pay 
rate, with Band A including the lowest 
paid 25% of employees (the lower 
quartile) and Band D covering the 
highest paid 25% of employees (the 
upper quartile). 

For there to be little or no gender pay 
gap, there would need to be the same 
ratio of men to women in each quartile 
band. A high ratio of men to women in 
Band D is likely to have a gender pay 
gap, as is a high ratio of women to 
men in Band A. 

Sport England is almost at parity in the 
middle Bands B and C. However, there 
is an imbalance of men and women 
in Band A (lowest paid) and Band D 
(highest paid). A likely cause of this 
is that women make up 61.4% of the 
office support/admin workforce.
