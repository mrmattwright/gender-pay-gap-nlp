GENDER PAY GAP

REPORT 2017

Save the Children is committed to achieving gender equity in pay. 
Our values as an organisation demand that women and men are 
equally rewarded for equal contributions, taking into account 
skills, grade and performance. Through our programme, policy 
and campaigning work, we strive to support gender equity in 
developing countries – and it is imperative that our organisation 
reflects the commitment to equity we demand of others. Our aim 
is to eliminate the gender pay gap by 2020 where this is being 
driven by any gender-based pay inequality (see below). 

Our gender pay gap 2017
•  Our median gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 was 8.25%.

•  The national median gender pay gap in 2017 was 18.10%.

•  Our mean gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 was 14.23%. 

•  Save the Children UK will always show a zero percentage for  

bonus payments as we do not operate a bonus pay scheme.

Our staff population was 75% female and 25% male.

Around 1.58% of the mean 2017 gender pay gap was accounted for  
by executive director salaries. 

Since 2016 we have taken or are in the process of taking a series of 
measures to address our gender pay gap, and issues of unconscious  
and conscious gender bias.

•  We have reviewed the way in which we recruit and continually seek ways to improve in 
this area. We have updated our training for line managers, introducing training modules 
on unconscious bias to ensure our interview skills training is values based. 

•  We are reviewing our job offer process to ensure parity and fairness of offers being 

made to new starters.

•  We are reviewing our family-friendly policies to ensure we offer equal provisions where 

we offer enhancements to pay.

•  We have reviewed our salary structure and are in the process of developing a total 
reward offer that will reset the way we pay and reward our staff; how we deal with 
organisation design and structures; and how we manage our talent.

•  By 2020 we will have mechanisms in place to carry out regular equal pay audits to 

ensure that our gap is not as a result of any gender-based pay inequality.

•  We are working on our diversity and inclusion strategy to improve our gender diversity, 

among other things, across every grade in the organisation.

•  We have agreed a Gender Equality Policy across all Save the Children offices, in which 

we have committed to prioritise gender equality in staff recruitment, orientation, 
promotion, and retention. We will strive for equity among women and men at all levels 
of the organisation, including senior leadership. Work has already commenced with the 
inclusion of gender equality awareness training within the mandatory induction for all 
new starters. 

•  We have committed to invest more in staff training on gender equality at all levels; this 

will be bolstered by a revamped learning and development offer in 2018.

•  We have committed to integrate gender equality within our core competencies for 

talent review process.

•  We have committed to dedicate appropriate funding to fulfil gender equality 

commitments, as demonstrated by our support for gender adviser roles in different 
divisions of the organisation.

•  We have committed to make it a priority to foster a safe, gender-sensitive work 

environment for all staff. We have introduced Respect in the Workplace training, which 
is mandatory for all employees; provided guides to line managers and other staff on how 
to deal with and raise concerns about inappropriate behaviour in the workplace; created 
an Integrity Line that enables employees and others to raise concerns anonymously; and 
made our anti-bullying and harassment policy and grievance policy readily accessible 
on our intranet. Our senior leadership team champions our values and is committed to 
upholding respect in the workplace and zero tolerance towards bullying and harassment.

During 2018 we aim to continue to address the gender pay gap by:

•  Implementing changes to our recruitment process to minimise unconscious bias in 

hiring managers’ decision-making. Recruitment panels have both male and female panel 
members. Hiring decisions are those of the panel, not just the hiring manager. We will 
continue to review the way we recruit in order to eliminate potential gender bias in our 
recruitment decisions.

•  Continuing to develop and deliver training for line managers on equality of opportunity, 

unconscious bias and other issues. 

•  Running workshops for managers on the issue of the gender pay gap and their role and 

responsibility in applying good practice. 

•  Implementing our total reward offer will enable us to develop a healthy organisation 

by introducing revised pay and grade management, spans of control and layers of 
management, and through how we manage our talent. 

•  Implementing new job grades and pay scales to make it transparent and clear to staff 
where they are on the salary scale and how they can progress by acquiring new skills, 
taking on more responsibility, or moving up to the next job level.

•  Introducing generic job titles, linked to job families that will be tied to progression, talent 

management and the overall reward structure.

We remain committed to be transparent in our approach to setting pay and reward. Our 
approach to pay and how it is determined is published in our Pay Policy on our Intranet. 
Our principles are to pay our staff a fair salary that is competitive within the charity 
sector, proportionate to the complexity of each role, and commensurate with their 
responsibilities, in line with our charitable objectives. 

Save the Children UK operates a performance-related pay system. The aim of this system 
is to ensure that pay reflects performance by rewarding strong performance and managing 
improvements to weaker performance. We are a living wage employer and meet all 
national pay standards, including providing all paid staff with a living wage.

This statement is made pursuant to The Equality Act 2010  
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 and constitutes  
our Gender Pay Gap statement for the snapshot as at 5 April 2017.
