UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT
2017

We firmly believe that for employees to be their best, inclusion and diversity are critical. A diverse and inclusive workforce reflective of UK 
society can support a successful, innovative and high performing company that provides a better service to our customers. It underpins our 
ability to remain competitive and keeps our outlook filled with fresh viewpoints.

We want to run a successful organisation that takes career progression seriously for everyone 
and respects, understands and values difference. We want our employees to feel that they work 
with colleagues who recognise and value their contribution and individuality, helping to ensure 
that Thales is a welcoming and rewarding place to build a career for all. 

In support of this goal, in 2017 we launched the global Thales Commitments towards People, 
which describes the level of ambition we have in relation to the environment we create for 
our people. 

Thales therefore welcomes the UK Government’s requirement for large companies to be more 
transparent about gender pay; we are pleased to publish the statistics contained in this document, 
on our Thales website and on the Government website dedicated to Gender Pay Gap Reporting.

UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017EQUAL PAY AND THE GENDER PAY GAP ARE NOT THE SAME

GENDER PAY GAP
The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women, 
irrespective or role or seniority, expressed as a percentage of the hourly pay rate of male 
employees. It is reported on a mean (average) basis, and median (middle point) basis.

EQUAL PAY
In contrast, an Equal Pay issue can arise where one gender is paid less than the other for 
performing the same or comparable work. Since the 1970s, UK law has prohibited paying 
different amounts to men and women who are performing the same or comparable work, 
unless there is a “genuine material factor” for doing so.

EXAMPLE
If a hypothetical company has 30 employees with ten each in Grades A, B and C and each 
grade pays the same salary:
Grade A: £60,000 | Grade B: £40,000 | Grade C: £20,000
Grade A has two female and eight male
Grade B has five female and five male
Grade C has eight female and two male

Overall mean salary of the organisation is: 

£40,000

Mean Gender Pay Gap is: 

Median Gender Pay Gap is: 

33.33%

66.67%

Despite the fact that male and female employees at each grade are paid equally, 
the fact that there are more male employees in the higher paying grade results in 
a gender pay gap.

Consequently, organisations like Thales with a large proportion of male employees, especially 
in higher paid senior roles, will typically report a Gender Pay Gap – but this does not mean 
that there are any issues with equal pay. At present 20% of our UK workforce is female and 
13% of our current senior workforce – with around one third of job families having no female 
employees in senior roles. These are key factors in understanding why a Gender Pay Gap 
exists in our organisation.

UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017THALES IN THE UK: OVERALL RESULTS
Pay Gap is the difference between the mean and median male and female hourly pay 
across the whole organisation irrespective of role or seniority. The gross hourly pay includes 
not only base salary but various allowances and other pay elements as specified in the 
regulations. Pay Gap uses data from April 2017.

Bonus Gap is the difference between the mean and median male and female bonus pay 
received in the 12 months ending on 5th April 2017. Bonus pay includes money and other 
forms of remuneration such as vouchers and securities – again, as specified in the regulations.

UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017WHAT ACTIONS ARE WE TAKING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
Thales does have a Gender Pay Gap which follows the UK national average, but we are already taking action to address it. These are enablers to 
achieving our overall Thales Commitments.

THALES COMMITMENT 
TO CREATE AN OPEN MINDED WORKFORCE THAT VALUES THE 
DIVERSITY EMPLOYEES BRING WHATEVER THEIR BACKGROUND

THALES COMMITMENT 
TO ENSURE MANAGERS TRUST THEIR EMPLOYEES,  
EMPOWER THEM AND CARE ABOUT THEIR WELL-BEING

Attracting, recruiting and including diverse new talent. We are diversifying our early careers 
pipeline by reviewing our attraction and selection approaches to ensure we recruit a diverse 
range of talent and our selection processes are as inclusive as possible. In 2018 we have 
committed to employing 117 people into graduate and internship positions and 79 individuals 
onto apprenticeship programmes across our UK business.

To further diversify our early careers pipeline, we have partnered with the Prince’s Trust to provide 
45 individuals aged 16 to 30, not in education, employment or training from a diverse range 
of backgrounds with a work experience and employability programme. We appointed 21 of 
these individuals into STEM roles in our business. This programmes has hugely challenged our 
businesses to be more inclusive and identify talent from a broader range of pools. 

Working in partnership with the Prince’s Trust we are focusing in 2018 on how we attract more 
females to these programmes through more creative attraction and engagement strategies. 
Another important partnership for Thales in the UK is with Women in Science and Engineering 
(WISE). During 2017 we have actively supported their ‘9%isnotenoughcampaign’ and have 
rolled out their ‘people like me’ training to a cohort of our STEM engineering ambassadors 
encouraging more girls into STEM careers. 

We are improving the capability of our managers. 2018 will see the introduction of a ‘licence 
to hire’ training programme for hiring managers to educate them on objective and inclusive 
recruitment. The programme helps managers to learn how to recruit objectively and inclusively 
through competency based recruitment. It also teaches our hiring managers how to think fairly, 
understand how their unconscious bias can impact their decisions in the recruitment and selection 
process and how to manage this. 2018 looks to consolidate and continue to improve the 
percentage of females we bring into our business by including focus on raising awareness of 
those with parental and caring responsibilities and embedding our smart working programme.

THALES COMMITMENT 
TO ENSURE EMPLOYEES HAVE THE MEANS AND  
SUPPORT TO MANAGE THEIR WORK LIFE BALANCE

As part of this commitment we are launching smartworking@thales which is a culture change 
programme encouraging teams to work more efficiently taking account of customer and 
business requirements whilst balancing the needs of individuals. Teams are asked to create 
and agree to a team charter which articulates their team commitment to how, when and 
where they will work. This has supported more inclusive arrangements to accommodate the 
diversity of the employee population we have.

During 2017 we signed the Time to Change pledge and implemented a scheme of training to 
create a network of more than 150 Mental Health First Aiders across the UK. We plan to 
continue the scheme in 2018 as part of our commitment to promote a culture of openness in 
which support is offered and diversity is celebrated.

UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017AN ON-GOING WIDE RANGING EDUCATION  
AND AWARENESS PROGRAMME
We are continuing to educate, create discussion and spark conversation throughout our 
organisation on our strategic topic of diversity and inclusion. We have centred this on 
helping to challenge our people’s mind-sets and thinking to continue our journey to achieving 
a fully diverse and inclusive working environment and culture. Below are examples of some 
more things we are doing.

We are continuing to educate and raise awareness of our HR and senior leadership community 
on how diversity and inclusion can improve business performance through a series of 
workshops and discussion sessions focused on helping them to promote positive change.

As part of the Thales Group transformation in the UK we have rolled out a communications 
campaign which aimed to raise awareness of stereotyping bias with a range of stereotyping 
examples including gender; this not only raised awareness but sparked great conversation 
and debate amongst all our employees.

In partnership with WISE (Women into Science & Engineering) we have worked on educating 
our broader business on gender balance and the barriers for women in the workplace with a 
world café event for our HR community. 

This year’s International Women’s Day in the UK saw the launch of our Women in Thales 
network for our Transport business and this has given us the opportunity to raise awareness of 
barriers to inclusion for women. .

The information contained in this report will continue to inform current and future initiatives and 
actions, as we continue on our journey to deliver our Thales Commitments with a diverse and 
inclusive workforce.

UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017OUR RESULTS
As the Thales organisation in the UK operates as one, the above statistics and narrative 
incorporates all entities. Under the regulations, however, we are required to report separately 
for each legal entity with more than 250 employees. 

Our legal structure therefore requires us to publish statistics for three separate entities in the UK 
– these are summarised here, along with the combined results for our transportation business.
