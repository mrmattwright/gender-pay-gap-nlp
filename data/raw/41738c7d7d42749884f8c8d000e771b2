Gender pay gap 
Report 2017

Marshall Motor Holdings plc 
The automotive sector has historically been male
dominated but we are committed to try to ensure we
have  a  fair  representation  of  men  and  women.
Currently our gender split is 75% male 25% female.
Given this context, we have more males in senior
roles than females which impacts average salaries.  

We have a long heritage built on family values and
we    endeavour  to  live  our  Values  every  day;  our
values of fairness and integrity and keeping people
at the heart of our success are a key focus for us. 

We have achieved Great Place to Work status for 8
years and for the 3rd consecutive year have been
ranked  in  top  30  Best  Large  Workplaces.  We  are
committed  to  ensuring  all  colleagues  believe
Marshall is a great place to work. 

We  believe  in  opportunities  for  all,  regardless  of
gender and we must continue to challenge ourselves
to be inclusive at all times.  We are committed to
ensuring men and women are paid equally for doing
equivalent roles in our business.

Understanding the gender pay gap
Using the calculations  prescribed in the gender pay
gap reporting regulations, we have taken pay data
for all our colleagues , which includes many different
roles and therefore a variety of rates of pay

Median = the mid point in a range of numbers

What’s included in our calculations?
Calculations are required to be based on pay from
April 2017, including ordinary pay (which includes
basic pay/holiday pay/shift allowances) and bonus
pay (profit share bonus/commission payments)  

What is the gender pay gap?
A gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in
the average pay of men and women – regardless of
the work they do – across an organisation, business
sector, industry or the economy as a whole.  It is
affected by the number of men and women across
all roles.

It is different from an equal pay comparison, which
is  direct  comparison  between  men  and  women
carrying out the same, similar or equivalent work.

How are we working to address the gap?

+ Sales Executives are an important colleague population and since 2016 we have been actively working to remove
any  barriers  that  might  exist  to  encouraging  more  females  to  take  up  these  exciting  roles.  We  provide  extensive
training  during  induction  and  have  introduced  a  guaranteed  income  for  the  first  year  to  overcome  any  perceived
concerns around salary and commission. As a result, the number of female Sales Executives has increased from 9%
in April 2016 to 11.27% in April 2017

+ The number of female colleagues in support functions (Finance, IT, HR, central administration) has increased from

59.8% in April 2016 to 63.9% in April 2017

+ The number of females in dealership based roles is 23% and we are committed to doing all we can to increase this:
   • We are co-partners in an industry initiative called ‘Drive my Career’ which is a new portal designed to encourage

more people into the industry generally, and highlights multiple opportunities for both men and women

   • We are reviewing our recruitment campaigns to ensure we can attract more female candidates
   • We are reviewing our training and development progammes specifically to encourage female colleagues to progress

+ All colleagues receive broad Equality & Diversity training to help ensure we are living our values and have an inclusive culture

+ All managers receive specific Equality & Diversity training to help ensure there is no unconscious bias when recruiting, etc.

+ Through our ongoing Great Place to Work surveys, we will continue to monitor how colleagues feel about being part

of Marshall and specifically to ensure they feel we have an inclusive culture.
