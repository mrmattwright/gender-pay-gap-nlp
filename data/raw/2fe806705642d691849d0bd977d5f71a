This is at the heart of everything we do. We pride ourselves in our key philosophies of inclusion, freedom and responsibility, working to your strengths and having a sense of meaning in your work. These underpin all that we do.  At Red Bull UK we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. We focus on managerial empowerment, market competitiveness and paying for performance.  Gender is not a factor in any of our compensation philosophy. Our compensation philosophies are to pay market median on base pay and pay for performance on variable pay.  Hourly pay - Mean: 30.47% - Median: 21.06% Bonus - Mean: 47.52% - Median: 0.88%  Portion of males receiving a bonus: 66.89% Portion of females receiving a bonus: 47.74%  Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that this is largely driven by our flexible and part time opportunities across the business, for example, our large student population. This impacts on the reporting of the figure here. The second largest factor contributing to this gap is driven by the fact that there are more men in senior higher-paid roles within the business.  When adjusting this figure to reflect the student population who work varied hours and our two board members, the gap reduces to:  Hourly pay - Mean: 7.69% - Median: -0.13% Bonus - Mean: 16.62% - Median: -0.90%  Portion of males receiving a bonus: 85.34% Portion of females receiving a bonus: 86.36%  This reflects that differences here can be explained by experience and specific skill sets. We are keen to encourage all of our workforce, especially women, to seek senior positions within the company, and we have taken a number of steps to support all those seeking leadership roles. This includes mentoring, supporting flexible working and examining our recruitment processes.  The chart below illustrates the gender distribution across Red Bull UK in four equally sized quartiles:  Men - Lower quartile: 5.75% - Lower middle quartile: 64.77% - Upper middle quartile: 47.13% - Top quartile: 54.55% Women - Lower quartile: 94.25% - Lower middle quartile: 35.23% - Upper middle quartile: 52.87% - Top quartile: 45.45%  We have analysed each job role with more than five people in the same role and are confident that we pay men and women equally for the same job. The only variants for pay are experience, individual performance and flexible workers. Salary sacrifice payments are included in the calculation, which also varies overall pay.  Having undertaken this analysis, we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business.  We continue to take action to address any gaps and to make sure our policies and practises are fair.
