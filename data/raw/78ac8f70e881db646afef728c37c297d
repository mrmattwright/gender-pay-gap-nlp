Gender Pay 
Gap Reporting  

31 March 2017 

 

Gender pay gap analysis examines the 
difference between the average (mean 
or median) earnings of men and 
women. This is expressed as a 
percentage of men’s earnings. Where a 
negative percentage shows this 
indicates women are better paid, 
where a positive percentage is shown 
men are better paid. 

 

Shrewsbury Colleges Group has 
approximately 500 members of staff 
and enrols almost 10,000 full and part-
time learners of all ages each year.  We 
offer an extensive range of business 
training opportunities for companies. 

Introduction 

In the UK, the gender pay gap for all employees, full-time and part-time was 18.1% as at November 2016. The 
Office for National Statistics has suggested that this bench mark is normally higher for Education establishments. 
Shrewsbury Colleges Group’s mean (average) gender pay gap is 5.29% and median (mid-point) gender pay gap is 
12.73% therefore considerably lower than the national average. 

Six calculations were used for the audit as follows: 

1.  Our mean gender pay gap 

2.  Our median gender pay gap 

3.  Our mean bonus gender pay gap 

4.  Our median bonus gender pay gap 

5.  Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment 

6.  Proportion of males and females in each quartile band. 

Report Date: This report is based on a ‘snapshot’ date of 31 March 2017 of the whole workforce employed at 
Shrewsbury Colleges Group as at this date.

Comments regarding mean and median is that a higher proportion of female employees (34%) are paid £20,000 or 
less per annum, this compares to 27% of all male employees which impacts on the overall mean (average) pay and 
the median (mid-point) pay.

Support Standards Payments are only applicable to 
Support Staff on Sixth Form College terms and condi-
tions. More female staff work within support than 
male staff which explains why the percentage for fe-
males is higher. Bonus is equal to all eligible to receive 
it by contract type. 

The following analysis provides the reader with some context to our gender pay analysis and understanding for pay 
differentials. 
 
1) Mean & Median overall figures  
 

  A higher proportion of female employees 34% are paid £20,000 or less per annum, compared to 27% of 

male employees which has an impact on both the mean (average) and the median (mid-point) pay.  

  A higher proportion of female employees, 70% are employed in lower paid administrative roles compared 
to 30% of male employees working in lower paid administrative roles which generates the gender pay gap 
of 5.29% (mean) and 12.73% (median). 

 

2) Pay Quartiles 

 

  27% of all female employees are paid within the first quartile (£6,560 to £18,695), whereas 21% of all 

male employees are paid within the first pay quartile. 

  27% of all female employees are paid within the second quartile (£19,365 to £26,535), whereas 22% of all 

male employees are paid within the second pay quartile. 

  22% of all female employees are paid within the third quartile (£26,535 to £35,290), whereas 31% of all 

male employees are paid within the third pay quartile. 

  24% of all female employees are paid within the fourth quartile (£35,290 upwards), whereas 27% of male 

employees are paid within the fourth pay quartile. 

 
Therefore a higher proportion of female employees 54% are paid within the first and second quartiles compared to 
male employees 43% and a higher proportion of male employees 58% are paid within the third and fourth pay 
quartiles compared to  46% of female employees. 

4) Bonus Pay 

 

Support Standards Payments (Bonus Pay) is only applicable to Support Staff on Sixth Form College terms and 
conditions. More female staff (16.33%) work within support than male staff (6.45%) which explains why the 
percentage for females is higher. 
 

Conclusion 

The College group’s workforce is made up of 64.44% female staff and 35.56% male staff and has a higher 
proportion of female employees in all categories Teaching, Management and Support. For the mean calculations 
the gender pay gap for teaching is insignificant at 1.22% and for Management and Support there is a bias towards 
females, therefore  in that category there is no specific gender pay gap in the context of this audit. 

However, a gender pay gap exists for the overall mean (average) pay of 5.29% and the median (mid-point) pay 
which is a difference of 12.73% for females, this reflects that a higher proportion of female staff occupy the lower 
paid administrative roles. 

As a college we are committed to ensuring that our staff are not discriminated against because of their gender. 
Most of our salaries are based on nationally agreed payscales which  are consistently applied to both male and 
female employees.
