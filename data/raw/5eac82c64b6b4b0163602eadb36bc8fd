GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

We welcome the gender pay gap regulations that were launched by the Government as part 
of a commitment to seeing every individual realise their potential in the workplace. Their 
aim is to achieve greater levels of transparency and encourage employers to consider what 
more can be done to close any gaps. 

Our Gender Pay Gap
We have analysed our results and recognise there is work to be done in order to close the 
gender pay gap at Ince & Co. We are confident that we pay our people equally. Encouragingly, 
our results show a minimal gender pay gap in our solicitor community. However, as has 
been observed across the legal services industry, we have a higher proportion of women in 
secretarial and part-time roles, and a higher proportion of men working in more senior business 
services roles, which has impacted our overall figures, including our bonus gender pay gap.

Ince & Co has been actively making changes to ensure that everyone has the opportunity 
to achieve their full potential. These steps include: launching our new associate career 
path; moving from lock-step to meritocratic pay; changing our bonus scheme; introducing 
and establishing agile working; up-skilling current employees with apprenticeships; and 
introducing a dedicated and active partner-led Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee. 
We believe these and other measures will have the effect of reducing our gender pay gap 
and we will continue to measure this on an ongoing basis. We intend to publish information 
regarding equity partners in our next report.
