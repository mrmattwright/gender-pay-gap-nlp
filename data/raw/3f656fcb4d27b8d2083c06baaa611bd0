The gender pay gap measures the difference between men and women’s average hourly pay across the whole organisation, regardless of job. This is different to ‘equal pay’ which means that men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs roles must be paid the same.  Prezzo welcomes these new regulations, which will lead to greater transparency and encourage action to reduce the gender pay gap.
