Gender Pay Report 

2017-18 Reporting Year 

Introduction 

 

Trenitalia c2c is responsible for running the Essex 
 
Thameside Railway Franchise, running operations 
 
between Shoeburyness in South Essex to Fenchurch 
Street in the City of London.  
 
 
We directly employee 680 employees (at the time of 
 
writing) of which 81% are employed in an operational 
capacity.  
 
 
Overall, 24.9% of our workforce is female (at the 
 
time of writing). Historically, the sector has seen 
 
employment dominated by males, in part due to high 
representation in operational roles such as Train 
 
Drivers (94.3%), where as 35% of our management 
positions are occupied by females. 
 
 
Our Gender Pay Gap is 19% (Mean), 22% (Median).

Gender Pay Gap 

 

Our Gender Pay gap for the reporting year 2017-18 is 
 
19% (Mean) & 22% (Median). 
 
 
This is comparable with other Train Operating 
 
Companies where the workforce across the industry 
has been historically male-dominated. High male 
 
representation in higher paid roles such as that of 
Train Driver (95.3% male as at Snapshot date) is one 
 
of the main factors in the current gap.  
 
 
Whilst female representation in our Senior 
 
Management grades (and above) is rising, it is still 
under-represented (28.3% at Snapshot date) although 
 
this is reflective of the gender distribution of the 
overall workforce. The higher proportion of males 
 
employees in these grades contributes to the overall 
gap.

2. Bonus Gender Pay Gap & 3. Proportion of Males and Females receiving a bonus 
 
Our Bonus Gender Pay gap for the reporting year 2017-18 is 23% (Mean) & 0% (Median). Where bonus data for part-timers is 
not adjusted to represent a full-time equivalent, this has an impact on the Mean % Gap.  
 
At the snapshot date, 32% of the female workforce were employed on Part-Time contracts in comparison to just 9.3% of males. 
We have a high bonus eligibility rate across our workforce, which is represented in a high percentage of those eventually 
receiving a bonus. The proportion is impacted by factors such as eligibility (start date of employment).

Proportion of Males and Females in each 
quartile pay band 
 
The overall proportion of females in the relative 
 
quartiles are in line with the general causes of the 
existing gap as previously detailed. 
 
 
 
Higher male representation in Senior Management 
grades (and above) and a male dominated workforce 
 
in the Driver grade is represented in low female 
representation in the Upper quartiles.

Addressing the Gap 

•Through our recruitment practices, we continue seek to attract more women into considering careers within the Railway 
industry and into technical roles that tend to be higher paid and historically under-represented. 
  
•Nurture female talent within the business to support opportunities for progression into senior management roles and technical 
roles. 
 
•Look at where we can offer increased flexible working opportunities in technical roles to increase the potential for attracting 
female talent. 
 
 
I confirm that this statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
