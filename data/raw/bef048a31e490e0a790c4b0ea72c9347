UK legislation introduced in 2017 requires all organisations in England with 250 or more employees to publish their Gender Pay Gap figures. This includes the gap between the mean and median average hourly rates of pay for men and women, the gap between mean and median bonus payments to men and women, and information on the proportion of men and women that make up each staff pay quartile.  More information on reporting requirements and methodology  It is important to note that gender pay gap figures are not the same as equal pay figures. Gender pay gap figures are reported across all staff, including Distance Learning (DL) Tutors and casual staff who were working during the snapshot period, and are represented as one average hourly rate of pay. Equal pay looks at whether staff are paid the same for work of equal value. As a matter of good practice, LSHTM will commission an independent review of equal pay in the coming months.  LSHTM gender pay gap figures  On the snapshot date (31 March 2017) LSHTM employed 1,550 staff of whom 979 were female and 571 were male.  Hourly rate:  Mean gender pay gap: 18.0%  Median gender pay gap: 9.4%  Bonus pay:  Mean bonus pay gap: 60.8%  Median bonus pay gap: 50.0%  Proportion of staff group who received a bonus:  2.9% of women  4.9% of men  Proportion of men and women in each quartile:   Quartile    % women in quartile    % men in quartile    Top quartile    46.7%    53.3%    Upper middle quartile    64.4%    35.6%    Lower middle quartile    67.5%    32.5%    Lower quartile    71.8%    28.2%   At the snapshot date, 63% of LSHTM staff were female, with the highest percentages of women at the more junior grades. As with other Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), the gender pay gap reflects this weighting.  LSHTM awarded bonuses to 28 men and 28 women in the 2016/17 round. The bonus gap arises from proportionately fewer women being awarded bonuses, and the link between staff salary and bonus value. Therefore, men were more likely to receive a higher value of bonus in comparison to women.  Gender pay gap analysis and comparisons with the sector will be available once other institutions have published their figures.  LSHTM is proud of the diversity of its staff and student bodies. LSHTM’s current workforce is 62% female, and women account for 66% of our student population. Whilst there is more work to be done, initiatives are already in place to increase the proportion of women in senior grades, both for academic and professional services roles. LSHTM strives to ensure that principles of equality, diversity and inclusion are engendered by all staff, and are at the heart of our policies, procedures, and our ethos.  What we are doing:  Fairness and Transparency: Progress has been made in applying consistent and fair salaries for senior academic staff with the introduction of professorial salary banding. A review of the Higher Education Role Analysis (HERA) process has also been undertaken to ensure this process is robust and effective in the role grading for Professional Services staff. Both processes place a strong focus on fairness and transparency in the setting of salary. We will continue this work by monitoring impact and regular benchmarking.  Promotions and Recruitment Processes: Modifications have been made to the academic promotions process to ensure it is fair and accessible to all staff and staff are proactively encouraged to apply for promotion when they are ready. We will be looking at how we recruit externally to ensure wide search pools and encouragement for underrepresented groups.  Bonus Review Exercise: We will be reviewing and carefully considering the provision of bonuses, while ensuring there are no barriers to staff being fairly rewarded for their hard work.  Continued focus on positive cultural change: We will continue to champion the work of our Athena SWAN groups as they work to identify and address the root causes of imbalances where they exist, and we will continue to improve the working environment for all staff.  Throughout 2018, LSHTM will be celebrating and supporting women in global and public health , culminating in LSHTM hosting the 2 nd Women Leaders in Global Health Conference in November. Working with our partners, we will advance a collective new vision for global health leadership and build opportunities for women to progress in all forms of leadership – from local communities to classrooms, from science to politics.  We are clear that more needs to be done to narrow our gender pay gap. In addition to the initiatives already underway, we will be exploring other opportunities that will ensure LSHTM’s  commitment to fostering an ethical and healthy environment built on respect, equal opportunities, excellence and creativity remains paramount to everything we do.
