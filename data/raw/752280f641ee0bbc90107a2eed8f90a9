Welcome to our website. Advance Trust was established in 2013 and 
			   consists of four schools working with children and young people 
			   who have additional needs. Our guiding principles are centred 
			   around enabling independence and the aspiration to realise the 
			   full potential of every individual within our schools.  We share unshakeable faith that every child and young 
			   person will grow and thrive - given the right conditions. We 
			   promise to seek and provide the right conditions for every child 
			   and young person in our schools so that they can live safe, 
			   healthy and productive adult lives.  We are committed to the concept of "life- long learning" and will 
			   seek to unleash the untapped potential in every child, young 
			   person and adult within Advance Trust.  We are committed to including, empowering and uplifting the 
			   families and carers of children and young people.
