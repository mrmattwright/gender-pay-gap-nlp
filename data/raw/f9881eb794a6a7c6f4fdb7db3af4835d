 

Gender pay report 

April 2017 

The Queen’s College, Oxford employs over 250 people and is thus required to publish its gender pay 
gap statistics under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. The College 
is committed to gender equality in the workplace.  
We are confident that men and women are paid the same for doing the same job at Queen’s. However, 
men and women are often employed in different roles across our organisation creating a gender pay 
gap. We actively encourage diversity in recruitment.
