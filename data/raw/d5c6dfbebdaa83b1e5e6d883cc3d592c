In common with all public sector organisations and UK companies with 250 or more employees, we are have a legal requirement, under the Equality Act 2010, to conduct an annual audit; a snapshot of the pay gap between what men and women earn within Wiltshire Police at 31 March 2017. The Report shows the percentage difference between mean (average) and median (mid-point) hourly earnings of men and women in the workplace.  This is a different concept to equal pay - it is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman and men and women are paid equally at every grade in the Force.  However if one gender dominates higher pay graded roles, this results in a gender pay gap. Traditionally policing was a very male dominated profession.  However I am pleased that in Wiltshire we have come a long way. We now employ virtually equal numbers of men and women overall in staff and officer roles - 1,098 men and 1,031 women (March 2017).     In our staff roles, females outweigh males on a ratio of 60:40 (662 females to 443 males).   By contrast, our officer numbers show a 36:64 ratio       (369 females to 655 males).   This accounts for the difference in the mean and median pay for male and female officers and staff - there are more male police officers, more male officers in senior positions and more female staff than male. We are seeing more women gaining promotion to senior roles - this helps to demonstrate the career paths available to officers and staff when joining the Force.  Visibility is so important and I am proud that Wiltshire Police will be hosting a regional ' Women in Leadership' policing conference this autumn, supporting women in all roles to become the leaders of tomorrow. Operationally, we need to do more to support women into senior police officer roles, as well as specialist operational roles such as firearms, roads policing and dog handling, through activity like awareness events and recruitment campaigns.  Our team of dedicated Positive Action officers supports all under-represented groups to encourage them to consider a career in policing and progress into specific roles.  Through Positive Action we can increase female representation and remove real or perceived barriers that may exist, such as flexibility around childcare and flexible working hours. Greater diversity and inclusion runs through the heart of our Force and is central to our values based culture.  I am committed to unlocking the talent in everyone as part of a true learning organisation.  Our people need to be a true representation of the diverse communities we serve and this means ensuring our workforce mix accurately reflects this.  There is much work to do, but I welcome the opportunity for greater transparency through open reporting.
