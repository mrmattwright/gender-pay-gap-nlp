All our employees should be able to fulfil their potential in a workplace free from discrimination and harassment where diverse skills, perspectives and backgrounds are recognised and valued.  In order to achieve this, it is important that we collect, store and analyse data relating to our workforce. Workforce monitoring is a useful tool for the council to measure whether our equality and human resources policies and practices are effective. This information is also required for the purpose of fulfilling the council’s statutory employment duties.  We do not want to intrude into an employee’s personal life but we do want to ensure that the entire workforce can work in a safe and welcoming environment that allows them to fulfil their potential free from discrimination.
