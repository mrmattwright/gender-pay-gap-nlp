Gender
Pay Gap
Report

The information below shows our “Gender Pay Gap”. This is simply a snapshot of
the difference between the average hourly pay levels of all women compared to all
men, regardless of their number, role or seniority. This is in line with the legal
reporting requirements and it is not a comparison between individuals doing the
same or similar work of equal value. It is therefore important to note that Gender
Pay Gap is not about Equal Pay for Men and Women doing the same or similar
jobs.

The Gender Pay Gap Regulations require us to report the
figures for legal entities with more than 250 employees – in
our case, Radius Systems Limited only. However, we have
chosen to publish the Mean and Median Gender Pay Gap
figures for the Radius Group in addition to Radius Systems
Limited. We believe it would be artificial simply to consider

only one Group Company and to disregard the others. At
Radius Systems Limited we believe in providing equality
and diversity amongst our workforce.
As such, we
welcome the opportunity to publish the information
required under the Gender Pay Gap Regulations.
