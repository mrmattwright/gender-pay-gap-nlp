GENDER PAY 
GAP REPORT

At XPO Logistics in the UK, we have three legal entities that employ
250 or more colleagues. These entities are: XPO Supply Chain UK 
Limited, XPO Transport Solutions UK Limited and XPO Bulk UK Limited.

We welcome the government’s initiative to have companies publish
their gender pay gaps as a step forward in legislating for equality.

MAKING OUR DIFFERENCE

A message from Mark Simmons, Executive HR and QHSE Director, XPO Logistics, UK:

We are pleased to provide this report on our UK organisation’s progress in narrowing the gender pay gap. 

We operate in an industry that historically has employed men. Change is taking root, but the industry itself presents 
some unique challenges. For example, our business must satisfy the numerous contracts we have in place across 
approximately 200 sites, each contract designed to suit the terms and conditions of a speciﬁc customer. Despite this 
complexity, our colleagues in like-for-like roles, such as drivers and warehouse operatives, are compensated and 
treated the same across our UK footprint.

Our colleague demographic in the UK is 79% male and 21% female. This has improved by 3% in favour of females over 
the last three years. Our gender split mirrors the rest of the UK distribution sector, and our performance compares 
favourably to the sector as a whole — but we’re committed to doing even better. 

Here are some highlights of our progress: 

■    The percentage of females entering our graduate training programme has increased from 38% to 54% over the 
       last three years. Last year, 44% of our apprenticeship recruits were female.

■    More women are advancing from middle to senior management roles within our business. Women account 
       for 35% of these promotions, versus 26% three years ago. This is a positive trend, and we intend to keep moving 
       in the right direction.  

■    We continue to focus on pay gap reductions through talent development and succession planning. Our You Grow, 
       We Grow internal promotion policy has become a core part of our People and Engagement strategy to support all 
       of our colleagues in their growth.

While our objective is not industry recognition, our efforts have been noted:

■    Two of our female colleagues were shortlisted for Young Woman in Logistics in 2017, an award given by Women 
        in Logistics. A year earlier we were honoured with Women in Logistics awards for Company of the Year and Young 
        Woman in Logistics. 

■    The Business Culture Awards presented us with the 2017 Gold Award and the Business Culture Achievement 
        honour for overall accomplishment.  

■    XPO was rated by Glassdoor as the 28th Best Organisation to Work For in the UK in 2017, and the only employer 
       in our sector in the top 100 UK businesses. Currently, our Glassdoor employee satisfaction rating is 4.6 out of 5.0. 
       We’re proud to be an employer of choice.

Looking forward, we’ll continue to reﬁne our diversity initiatives to ensure that our recruitment process is always fair 
and reflects XPO as an equal opportunity workplace. There is more work to be done to ensure equal treatment, but 
we’re conﬁdent that the strides we’re making will continue to close our gender pay gap toward our ultimate goal 
of zero.

We conﬁrm that the data reported is accurate, based on a data snapshot from April 5th, 2017. In accordance with
the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, XPO Logistics is required to carry out this 
Gender Pay Gap reporting.

XPO LOGISTICS - UK GENDER PAY GAP

Our mean gender pay gap at present is 11% for Supply Chain, 14% for Transport Solutions and 14% for 
Bulk. This compares favourably to the UK distribution sector. Our goal, however, is to reduce the gap to 
zero. Total employee counts reflect all fully paid employees as of the April reporting period.

GENDER PAY GAP 
QUARTILE FIGURES 

Methodology:

1. The full list of hourly pay rates is sorted in order from  
     highest to lowest and then divided into four quartiles, 
     with an equal number of employees in each quartile.

2. The number of employees in each quarter is divided by 
     the total number of employees to obtain the 
     percentages by gender.

BONUS PAY - GENDER PAY GAP

In our overall business, we have a higher proportion of male employees to females, which puts more males 
in a position to be eligible for a potential bonus. We have a number of female colleagues in senior roles 
who are eligible for a potential bonus, and most fall into the higher end of the scale for incentive payments. 
A notable statistic is in Transport Solutions, where 21.86% of females received bonuses, higher than any 
male percentage in the charts below.
