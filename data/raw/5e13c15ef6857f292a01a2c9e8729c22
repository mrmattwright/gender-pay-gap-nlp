GENDER 
PAY GAP 
REPORT 

March 2018

BACKGROUND

This is Benchmark’s first report 
based on the UK’s new gender 
pay reporting requirements. Data 
in this report relates to Benchmark 
UK employees only. 

As Benchmark has fewer than 250 employees  
in any one entity within the UK we are not required to 
report our gender pay gap figures, however, it has always 
been our intention to do so voluntarily. 

We believe in transparency and strive to attract a diverse 
workforce and provide equal opportunities throughout the 
business. This exercise will inform our future strategy  
for recruitment, training and development.

Calculating  
gender pay

The gender pay gap is an equality 
measure that shows the difference in 
average earnings between women and 
men across all UK employees and all 
roles. i.e. listing all male salaries and 
all female salaries (ranked highest to 
lowest) and calculating the mean and 
median in each list. The gender pay  
gap is the % difference between the  
two figures. 

As a general comment on the process, 
it is important to be aware that there 
is a potential bias in the method of 
calculation that could increase the 
pay gap for both basic and bonus pay. 
Overall more women tend to sacrifice 
salary for pension and childcare, yet 
these amounts must be deducted from 
the hourly rates before running the 
calculations, therefore reducing the 
average rates of pay. 

In addition, bonus figures are not 
adjusted for FTE (full-time equivalent) 
meaning that the bonus of someone 
working three-days per week is compared 
to the bonus of someone working full 
time. This could cause a further bias as 
more women, in general, work part-time.

Gender pay is  
different to equal pay

Equal pay means that men and women in 
the same employment performing equal 
work must receive equal pay, as set out 
in the Equality Act 2010. Gender pay is a 
measure of the difference between men’s 
and women’s average earnings across an 
organisation or the labour market.

THE BENCHMARK GENDER PAY GAP

Overall across the whole of Benchmark UK, 
the balance of men to women was 50:50 
during the snapshot reporting period 
(April 2017). Benchmark’s gender pay  
gap is strongly influenced by the gender 
make-up of the four pay quartiles (figure 1).

There are significantly more males 
than females in the two upper pay 
bands. As no one single entity has 
250 employees, the figures presented 
are an amalgamation of information 
covering 10 different payrolls, and 
people working across a range 
of sectors from agriculture and 
publishing to pharmaceuticals.

The pay gap and bonus differences  
are shown in figure 2 and 3.

1.  Pay calculations are based on FTE adjusted pay and include basic salary excluding salary sacrificed for pension 

contributions and childcare, plus allowances. Overtime payments are excluded from the calculations.

2.  Based on actual bonus paid in the 12 months prior to 5th April 2017. Total company bonus, commission and 

share payments are included in the calculations which are not adjusted for FTE.

Our data shows that although we have fewer 
women than men in our senior team the pay 
gap is in fact relatively small and women 
received higher bonuses on average.

WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO

Closing the Gap — Next Steps: 

1.
Challenging 
the recruitment 
process

We will ensure that recruiters  
provide us with a diversified shortlist 
for all senior positions.

2.
Training

Benchmark’s leadership and 
management team will receive 
unconscious bias training to help 
them to recognise their actions,  
both positive and negative.

3.
Creating a 
women’s network

To provide encouragement and  
support to women throughout 
Benchmark to put themselves  
forward for more senior roles.

4.
Mentoring

From other senior women in to  
those putting themselves forward.

5.
Focus Groups 

To hear from all areas of  
the business and inform our  
longer-term plan of action.

We are committed to boosting 
female representation at senior 
levels in the business to create a 
truly diverse and representative 
workforce and have implemented 
several measures to facilitate this.

The overall exercise of analysing the pay and bonus of 
the company workforce has been an extremely useful 
one, stimulating debate and helping to ensure that we 
encourage women into higher paid roles and develop 
policies and procedures with the aim of increasing the 
number of women across all layers of management. 

We recognise that this is an ‘Iceberg’ measure which  
refers to the fact that there are multiple reasons for 
the result and that there is much more going on under 
the surface than one metric alone can indicate. Good 
measures need to be practical to collect and reliable — 
so that they can be easily compared across companies. 
Therefore, using an ‘Iceberg’ measure as a national level 
metric at the very beginning of a process, is a useful 
starting point and we welcome the conversations and 
momentum this has brought.
