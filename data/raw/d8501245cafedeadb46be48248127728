GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017 
Introduction

With over 5,000 people in 17 different countries, Playtech is a company built by
and which thrives on people from diverse cultures, social backgrounds and beliefs.
Diversity is not just part of our heritage – it is critical for the long-term growth and
success of Playtech.

We welcome government, industry and cross-sector efforts to increase transparency
about gender pay and diversity. We also recognise that industries we operate in –
gaming, technology and financial services – have both an opportunity and an
imperative to build a more inclusive and equitable workforce for the future.

This year’s review of our gender pay gap data in the UK has highlighted that we
need to do more to meet our ambition to attract, retain, promote and empower a
truly inclusive workforce. In particular, we need to strengthen our investment in our
developing a pipeline of emerging and future female leaders, as well as a more
diverse talent pool generally.

The gender pay gap in the UK shows that we have an imbalance in pay across
different segments of our workforce. Two key factors drive this gap – the first of
these being the lack of women in senior roles in the UK, which will be a key area of 
focus over the next three years. Additionally, a significant number of our UK female
workforce  are  employed  in  chat  moderator  roles  that  are,  by  their  nature, 
lowersalaried, shift-based positions.

The Executive Committee of Playtech is committed to addressing this imbalance.

As such, we have set a timeline of three years to taking the following steps:

•  
 
•  
 
•  
 
•  
 

Improve the gender balance at board, executive and senior
management levels
Invest in and retain the next generation of leaders and talent by
increasing access to networking, mentoring and training initiatives
Futureproof our workplace policies and training to support the
progression of talent
Expand investment in and support for cross-industry partnerships and
initiatives to build a more inclusive sector(s)

These efforts will be underpinned by metrics and regular reporting to the Executive
Committee to monitor and track improvements.

OUR RESULTS: ALL UK EMPLOYEES – 2017

42% of Playtech’s 837 UK employees are
female. The two main factors behind the
gender pay gap are 1) the proportion of
women in home-based, shift-orientated
work and 2) low representation of women
in senior leadership positions.

70% of the UK female workforce are chat
moderators; home-based, shift workers
who inherently work flexibly, with the role
falling within the lower quartiles of our
pay bands. We are pleased to be able
to provide an employment option that

is flexible and can accommodate those
who may not be able to work during
regular business hours; for example, due
to family commitments. A high
percentage of employees in this role
are female. This coupled

with the role’s pay band position
naturally has a strong impact on the
gender pay gap statistics.

OUR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION INITIATIVES AROUND THE WORLD

Whilst we recognise there is much more to do, we would like to take this opportunity to 
highlight some examples of how we are helping to encourage and support a strong 
pipeline of female talent into the sector. These are just a few the initiatives we support 

around the world –  and is just the the beginning of our strategy to further promote and 
support diversity across the company.

ATTRACTING A DIVERSE PIPELINE OF TALENT 
- UK

As part of our strategy to promote diversity and gender balance in the workplace, 
we participated in the Women of Silicon Roundabout conference. The conference 
was  created  to  inspire  and  connect  women  working  in  technology  and  includes 
interactive panels, workshops and networking opportunities, with the aim of getting 
more women interested and involved in technology-based roles.

SUPPORTING DIVERSE TALENT  WITH 
SKILLS, NETWORK AND EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES - ESTONIA

Playtech is proud to spearhead and engage with initiatives aimed at empowering 
women  and  underserved  segments  of  society  to  access  and  be  successful  in  the 
digital economy. In 2017, Playtech Estonia hosted the kick-off of the Tartu chapter 
of  Tech  Sisters,  a  non-profit  organisation  with  a  vision  to  inspire,  educate  and 
encourage women and girls in technology and IT.  Playtech Estonia also participated 
in government initiative ‘Choose IT’; an adult retraining programme aiming to give 
participants  basic  software  developer  skills.  Participants  receive  a  basic  intensive 
training and internship in IT companies, and in 2017, we were pleased to welcome 
two  interns  to  our  Tallinn  office.  In  addition,  Playtech  Estonia  participated  in  a 
government initiative aimed at improving employment opportunities in IT for people 
with disabilities, with members of our team also donating expertise and hardware to a 
local Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) uniting people with physical disability.

EMPOWERING THE NEXT 
GENERATION OF WOMEN IN TECH: 
GIRLS IN TECHNOLOGY – GIBRALTAR 

Playtech is a proud founding sponsor of Girls 
in Tech - Gibraltar.  Girls in Tech is a global 
network of 64+ chapters, dedicated to the 
engagement,  empowerment,  education 
and  entrepreneurship  of  women  in  STEM 
fields.  The  Gibraltar  chapter  opened  its 
doors in Q1 2017, with the goal of effecting 
change  in  Gibraltar  and  the  surrounding 
communities.

The year’s calendar of events was kicked off 
with an incredibly successful launch event 
in June, attended by the Chief Minister of 
Gibraltar  and  the  Mayor,  which  received 
the  attention  of  professionals  in  both  the 
public and private sector.

Shortly  after  the  launch  event,  the  team 
immediately  planned  and  executed  the 
‘Women  in  Tech:  Stories’;  an  event  that 
gave local female technology professionals 
a  platform  to  deliver  their  personal  and 
professional  narratives,  talking  about  the 
challenges,  achievements  and  motivators 
that had played an influential part in their 
lives. The event was received positively and 
the team plan to deliver more ‘Women in 
Tech: Stories’ events in the future.

In  August,  Girls  in  Tech  executed  a  2-day 
Python programming language bootcamp. 
24  participants  with  little  to  no  technical 
knowledge  spent  a  gruelling  weekend 
learning  about  technology,  the  internet 
and,  most 
importantly,  programming 
through  a  mentor-guided  curriculum. 
Despite  minimal  previous  experience,  the 
participants  managed  to  deliver  a  fully 
functional  blog  application 
in  Python, 
not  only  successfully 
implementing  the 
software, but also taking care of their own 

deployments to the internet, allowing them 
to show off to their family and friends.

A lot of positive feedback has been received 
from  the  bootcamp  event,  with  the  team 
being  made  aware  of  some  participants 
seriously contemplating a technical career.

Finally, the year was closed with a hackathon 
event  called  ‘Hacking  for  Humanity’.  The 
Hacking  for  Humanity  hackathon 
is  a 
Girls  in  Tech  global  initiative,  where  each 
chapter  engages  with  local  communities 
and charities to understand the pain points 
and challenges that they face. 

The  hackers  participating  are 
then 
challenged  to  find  and  create  innovative 
and  forward-thinking  solutions  for  these 
issues.  These  solutions  are  presented  to  a 
panel  of  judges  at  the  end  of  the  event 
and  then  given  to  the  communities  and 
charities,  in  the  hope  they  can  provide 
positive  and  sustainable  benefits  in  the 
future.

featured 

The  Gibraltar  edition  of  the  Hacking  for 
Humanity  hackathon 
seven 
teams  of  three  to  five  people  working  on 
projects for Childline, Animals in Need and 
Understanding  Gibraltar.  The  Gibraltar 
Finance Centre joined the sponsors list and 
provided monetary prizes for the top three 
places,  with  first  place  receiving  £2,000 
in  prize  money  for  their  winning  solution, 
which  provided  a  complete  and  modern 
solution  to  replace  Childline’s  legacy  call 
centre and management software.

FOOTNOTE

This note is to confirm accuracy of the 
data. Both payroll and bonus data were 
sampled and reviewed by Playtech’s 
Internal Audit team. The payroll data 
reflects employees employed on the 
snapshot date. Payroll data includes 

basic pay, bonus, commissions and share 
options gains paid as part of payroll 
for April 2017. The bonus data reflects 
employees employed on the snapshot 
date, but received a bonus within the 
12-month period to 5th April 2017 (period 

being from 6th April 2016 to 5th April 2017).
Playtech’s Internal Audit team sampled 
data and reconciled it back to source 
documentation.
