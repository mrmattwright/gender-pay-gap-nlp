This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and the government gender pay website. We will do this within one calendar year from April 5 th 2017.  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace.  the balance of male and female employees at different levels.  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.  The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.   Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing HR and weekly PAYE payroll records.        1  Average gender pay gap as a mean average    15%    2  Average gender pay gap as a median average    4%    3  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average    14.5%    4  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average    0.5%    5  Proportion of staff eligible for bonus, actually received it  Male - 82%  Female - 75%    6  Proportion of men and women in the four banded pay groups  Male  Female      Lower salary Band1  30%  70%      Salary Band2  40%  60%      Salary Band3  15%  85%      Higher Salary Band4  65%  35%        Linsco is an equal opportunities employer and offer a tiered salary structure, irrespective of gender. We currently employ more women (66%) than men (34%).  All trainees and new staff are recruited under the same structure and their earning ability depends on their success and career progress. All employees are encouraged to grow and earn to their full potential. Any pay gap difference shown will be a result of differing roles & bandings, however all employees working in the same bandings will be earning the same rewards. Measures will take time to show, however through training, mentoring and support we will aim to reduce the pay gap figures so that it represents a more balanced and equal situation.  We strive to continually improve our gender gap and will publish the results again in April 2018 as requirement of the government initiative into equal pay        1  Average gender pay gap as a mean average    4%    2  Average gender pay gap as a median average    3%    3  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average    14.5%    4  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average    0.5%    5  Proportion of staff eligible for bonus, actually received it  Male - 82%  Female - 75%    6  Proportion of men and women in the four banded pay groups  Male  Female      Upper quartile  77 %  23 %      Upper middle quartile  58 %  42 %      Lower middle quartile  87 %  13 %      Lower quartile  80 %  20 %        Linsco is an equal opportunities employer and offer an internal tiered salary structure, irrespective of gender. Internally we employ more women (66%) than men (34%), and have a spread of external construction temporary workforce working on our clients behalf, of which 84% are men and 14% women.  This difference is highlighted in the official statistics for 2016, 87.6% of total construction workers in the UK were men, whilst 12.4% were women. We are pleased to see that our figures exceed the national averages.  In 2007, historical data shows that men accounted for 87.5% of the total construction workforce and women accounted for 12.5%, thus suggesting that the gender ratio has remained largely unchanged nationally.  Our results show that overall our gender pay gap is minimal in size (3% and 4% respectively) and one that we have little control over as it is our clients that set the rates of pay for the hired workers. The majority of our construction industry workers are male, something which we are inherently affected by and have little effect of changing.  In respect of the control we have over our own internal staff, all trainees and new internal staff are recruited under the same structure and their earning ability depends on their success and career progress.  All internal employees are encouraged to grow and earn to their full potential. Any pay gap difference shown will be a result of differing roles & bandings, however all employees working in the same bandings will be earning the same rewards.  We strive to continually improve our gender gap and will publish the results again in April 2019 as requirement of the government initiative into equal pay                 Cookie Policy        Personal Data FAQs  Data privacy is paramount        Privacy Policy                Main Links   Home  Clients  About     Useful Links   Saved Jobs & Searches  Gender Pay Statement  News & Views  Media and Supply Chain  Recruiter to Recruiter  Temporary workers     Get In Touch  0345 166 1978  Get the App    Follow Us          We are mobile      Cookie Policy  Privacy Policy  Site Map  Terms of Use  Terms of Use App  Powered by Kentico   © 2018 - Linsco Recruitment Limited
