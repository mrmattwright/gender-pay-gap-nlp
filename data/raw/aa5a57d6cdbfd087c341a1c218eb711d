HRP will be publishing our information on the Government website shortly.  These calculations show a snapshot of the average organisational position as at April 2017. We have also calculated pay and bonus gaps for each pay range to show a more complete picture. Details are shown in Appendix One.  Gender Pay Reporting is not the same as Equal Pay legislation – which requires individuals to be paid equally for doing the same/similar work and work of equal value. A recent independent Equal Pay Audit confirmed that HRP complies with Equal Pay requirements.             Gender Pay Reporting Results  HRP’s results show:   Women’s average hourly rate is 8.65% (mean) and 5.63% (median) lower than men’s.  Our pay distribution is: Top Quartile: 45% men, 55% women Upper Middle Quartile: 40% men, 60% women Lower Middle Quartile: 40% men, 60% women Lower Quartile: 33% men, 67% women  Women’s average bonus pay is 33.6% (mean) and 2.34% (median) lower than men’s.  74% of men and 64% of women received a bonus payment.  Our average hourly pay gap compares with the national gender pay gap of 18.1% (Office of National Statistics 2016).  Currently we have a larger proportion of men in our highest paid positions. This a major driver of our average hourly pay and bonus gaps. The lower proportion of women earning a bonus is due to higher numbers of women in our casual/seasonal roles, which do not attract a bonus. 98% of men and 98% of women who occupy roles that qualify for a bonus received a bonus.  The average pay and bonus gaps within our pay ranges (as shown in Appendix One ) are generally small or there are none. Where there are pay gaps these are mainly due to differences in length of service and/or role related Allowances. Where there are bonus gaps these are mainly due to a greater proportion of women working part-time and with shorter service, and thus earning a relatively smaller bonus.           Download     Appendix One – Gender Pay by Pay Range             Actions  Although our average pay gap is below the national gender pay gap of 18.1%, our aim is to have no gap at all. We will therefore:   Take action to improve the gender balance in the Executive Team.  Continue to support female talent to progress within the organisation.  Take action in future recruitment to improve gender diversity in roles which may be perceived as generally ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’ (i.e security/warding roles which are generally dominated by men, and seasonal/casual roles which are generally dominated by women.)
