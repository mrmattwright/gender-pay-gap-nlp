On the official “snap shot’ date, 5th April 2017, across six different legal entities in the UK, the ICS group employed or engaged more than 12,100 people in a diverse range of health, life science, staffing and social care roles. Our median hourly pay gap is 0.4% and our mean hourly pay gap is 15.7%.  Our Gender Pay Gap Report sets out the pay and bonus gap figures for each of the ICS group companies and demonstrates the actions we are taking to address our gender pay gap over time.  I look forward to feedback from all colleagues and to championing the issue of gender equality within our company.  Yours sincerely,  Richard MacMillan CEO  Download full report         Sitemap  |  Privacy & Cookies  |  Awards & Accreditations  |  Careers with us  |  Charity work  |  Contact us   © ICS 2018       Gender pay gap report
