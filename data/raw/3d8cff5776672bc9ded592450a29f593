Our Equality Statement  Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust is committed to the elimination of unlawful and unfair discrimination and values the differences that a diverse workforce brings to the organisation.  The Trust aims to be a fair employer and strives to achieve equality of opportunity for all creating inclusive workplace environments where everyone can work effectively towards the provision of better healthcare.  The Trust has a comprehensive policy setting out how it will work to deliver high quality services to all in  fair and equitable ways.  Delivering Equal Opportunities Valuing Diversity Policy  Gender Pay Gap Report 2018  The Report shows women staff earn 9% less than men, which is better than the national average, but still too big a gap.  The report sets out what the Trust plans to do to close the gap. Read the report in full here .  Meeting our public sector equality duty  Under the Equality Act 2010 as a public body the Trust has a general public sector equality duty to:   eliminate unlawful discrimination,  promote equality of opportunity and  foster good relations between people with different backgrounds.   As an NHS body the Trust is also under a specific duty to publish information on its performance and to set itself equality objectives designed to address any areas where service users or staff have identified weaknesses.  The Trust published much of that information in tis annual equality performance reports.  Equality and Diversity Report 2011  Equality and Diversity report 2012  Equality and Diversity Report 2013  Equality and Diversity Report 2014  Equality and Diversity Report 2015  Equality and Diversity Report 2016  Other performance measures  Like all other NHS bodies, the Trust uses the NHS Equality Delivery System (EDS). This is a performance framework which measures how well the people who use our services or work for us think we are doing in meeting their specific needs regardless of their sex, age, ethnicity, religious beliefs, disabilities, sexual orientation, marital status or whether they are pregnant or a nursing mother.  The Trust provides evidence  to local stakeholders on its performance against the four goals which are broken down into 18 outcomes.  The stakeholders then grade the Trust's performance based on its evidence and their own experience of the Trust as a care provider or employer.   The Trust's equality objectives and EDS grades are set out at the bottom of this page.  Since 2015 all NHS Trusts have been required to collect and publish data on delivering race equality within their workforce. This NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard, was introduced in part because of the association between the quality of outcomes for patients and the way Trust addressed fairness for their Black, Asian and other minority ethnic staff.  NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard Information for 2015  This year (2016) all WRES data will be published nationally to a standardised format.  Below is the Trust's action plan in response to its own data on the nine indicators in the WRES.  2016 Workforce Race Equality Standard Action plan  Equality Objectives 2012-16  As a ‘listed public authority’, under the Equality Act 2010 the Trust is required to prepare and publish equality objectives by 6 April 2012:   Objectives that we reasonably think we should achieve to meet one or more aims of the general equality duty.  Details of the engagement that we undertook, in developing our objectives, with people whom we consider to have an interest in furthering the aims of the general equality duty.   Using the NHS-wide Equality Delivery System (EDS) as the basis of engagement on the Trust’s equality objectives, the Head of Equalities and People & Organisational Development Communication has engaged with a wide range of ‘local interest’ groups, including service users, carers groups, communities and interest and trade unions. They were provided with information on the Trust’s performance, the EDS and invited to workshops on using the EDS and to actually grade the Trust’s performance. In addition in a unique move the EDS grading forms were put online and some 20 forms were completed via the website. The Trust’s workbook and model of online engagement has been recognised by NHS London in the region and nationally as an example of good practice.  Through three workshops, information sent by email and visits to community and service user organisations the Head of Equalities has engaged with over 20 organisations. Of these half have actively participated in the process, the outcome of which was a short list of six equality objectives was developed and put to the Trust Board with a recommendation that they review the suggested objectives and select up to five.  Below are the final objectives agreed by the Trust Board, the objectives have been cross referenced to the EDS goals and outcomes as well as mainstream Trust objectives for consistency and alignment. The colour codes indicate the grades given to the Trust’s performance in 2011.     EDS Goal and grade  Outcome areas  Trust Equality Objectives  Relevant Trust Objective     Better health outcomes for all    Services are commissioned, designed and procured to meet the health needs of local communities, promotes wellbeing, and reduce health inequalities    1.  In order to ensure that services are designed to meet the health needs of local communities, promote their wellbeing, and reduce health inequalities in line with the Trust’s clinical strategy, the organisation will systematically improve the collection, analysis and use of service outcome data for all protected characteristics, and relevant disadvantaged groups. Specifically –   From 2012-13 the performance of the transitions between parts of our services as well as to other health and social care providers will be monitored to ensure; patients are better informed about their options and the pathways, the transitions are smoother and patients and their carers give increased positive feedback about their experiences by gender, age, ethnicity, compared to the whole population  By 2013-14 relevant outcomes reported as part of the Trust Board performance dashboard will include outcome data for a minimum of five protected characteristic groups  By 2015-16 relevant outcomes reported as part of the Trust Board performance dashboard will include outcome data for all nine protected characteristic groups where relevant.   2.     The improvements in meeting the health needs of local communities, promoting their wellbeing, and reducing health inequalities will be measured by the Trust Board as part of its review of the Trust’s clinical strategy and other mainstream service quality management.  The mechanisms used will include the annual EDS process.   In line with the societal system approach of the Trust’s clinical strategy, the Trust will work in partnership to reduce health inequalities and promote wellbeing, specifically-  By 2013-14, based on the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment for each borough, the Trust will develop profiles of the communities / protected characteristic/ disadvantaged groups currently suffering the most serve health inequalities and develop effective channels to reach them with information about services, self-help and wellbeing.  The Trust will work in partnership with patients and other community groups to ensure there is meaningful engagement and by 2015-16 this will include representation from individuals and groups covering all nine protected characteristics and key disadvantaged groups we serve.   The level and effectiveness of engagement will be assessed by the amount and breath of involvement in key decision and policy setting fora and the quantity and quality of the input and impact groups have on changes to service and policy developments, training and senior appointments.  This will be monitored using evidence to the Patient/Service user strategy group and compliance data for the EDS    Providing better integrated and more holistic services      Individual patients’ health needs are assessed, and resulting services provided, in appropriate and effective ways      Changes across services for individual patients are discussed with them, and transitions are made smoothly”      The safety of patients is prioritised and assured. In particular, patients are free from abuse, harassment, bullying, violence from other patients and staff, with redress being open and fair to all      Public health, vaccination and screening programmes reach and benefit all local communities and groups      Improved patient access and experience    Patients, carers and communities can readily access services, and should not be denied access on unreasonable grounds”    3. The Trust will ensure through effective leadership, training and monitoring that staff respect and discuss with all patients their cultural, religious and spiritual needs as part of a holistic clinical assessment.  Specifically the Trust will   Ensure that year-on-year the percentage of patients who when surveyed agree that they have been given the opportunity to discuss cultural/spiritual needs increases so that by April 2015 it is at least 90%  Ensure that year on year the percentage of patients who when surveyed agree that discussions with staff about their care included their specific cultural/spiritual requirements, increases, so that by April 2015 it is at least 90%  Ensure that year on year the percentage of patients who when surveyed agree that they have been given the ability to practice appropriate religious/cultural beliefs in hospital will be at least 90% by April 2015   Ensure that year on year the percentage of patients who when surveyed agree that they have been given information about practicing their religion and access to the chaplaincy service or other faith leaders will be at least 90% by April 2015    Developing excellent services and staff      Patients and carers report positive experiences of their treatment and care outcomes and of being listened to and respected and of how their privacy and dignity is prioritised”      Patients’ and carers’ complaints about services, and subsequent claims for redress, should be handled respectfully and efficiently      Empowered, engaged and well-supported staff    Recruitment and selection processes are fair, inclusive and transparent so that the workforce becomes as diverse as it can be within all occupations and grades      Developing excellent services and staff      Levels of pay and related terms and conditions are fairly determined for all posts, with staff doing equal work and work rated as of equal value being entitled to equal pay      Through support, training, personal development and performance appraisal, staff are confident and competent to do their work, so that services are commissioned or provided appropriately      Staff are free from abuse, harassment, bullying, violence from both patients and their relatives and colleagues, with redress being open and fair to all      Flexible working options are made available to all staff, consistent with the needs of the service, and the way people lead their lives      Inclusive leadership at all levels    Boards and senior leaders conduct and plan their business so that equality is advanced,  and good relations fostered, within their organisations and beyond    4. The Trust will review and revise its appraisal and performance management system to ensure that corporate values and objectives around staff engagement and motivation to deliver quality care to all are incorporated and measured. It will also incorporate the Competency Framework for Equality and Diversity Leadership framework into the process as applied to the selection, development and appraisal of managers. The staff experience tracker and other survey methods will be used to assess performance as well as the comments of ‘grand-parents’ on appraisals.   In the first year 2012-13 the key performance indicator will be implementation of the revised system and the establishment of a baseline score. For 2013-14 and 2014-15 the key performance indicators will be  an agreed increase over 2012/13 in the percentage of completed and signed forms returned to POD by the deadline  an improvement  in staff views as measured in local and national surveys.    To reach as close to 100% as is practicable, for staff having an agreed annual performance review and PDP and returning completed forms to POD, by the deadline  Through the performance appraisal system ensure leaders at all levels, including the Trust Board; actively incorporate the Trust’s values and commitment to mainstreaming equalities in their management activities.
