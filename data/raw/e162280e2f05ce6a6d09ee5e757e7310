In order to be as transparent as possible, and to encourage further dialogue on this topic, BWB has also released a separate non-statutory report which details the gender profit gaps for the firm’s partnership as well as details on the overall gender pay and profit gap for the firm as a whole.  Please click here to read BWB’s reports in full.  In response to these figures, Martin Bunch , Managing Partner, BWB, said:  “ We welcome the opportunity to publish these figures, as well as the chance to be more transparent about where we stand in relation to each of the six pay metrics that we have published. By releasing additional statistics, we also hope to provide even more comprehensive analysis of our gender pay gap.  “We accept that these figures do not reflect where we want to be in relation to either our purpose and values, or in terms of our status as a B Corp. Although these statistics show that we still have much more to do in this area, we are firmly committed to taking a course of action that will help us to improve over time ”.
