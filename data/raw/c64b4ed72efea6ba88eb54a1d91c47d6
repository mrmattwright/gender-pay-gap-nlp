Our Gender Pay Gap Report 2017
We are passionate about fairness, equity, inclusion and reducing

our gender pay gap.

What it is about?

Broadacres sees the sharing of our Gender Pay Gap Report as an integral step in 
having more meaningful conversations about equality. We do recognise that, for a 
growing number of people, gender doesn’t simply refer to male or female. For the
purposes of this report, though, our gender pay gap is calculated using the 
approach required by the regulations, which compares the pay of males and
females.

By law we are required to publish data regarding our mean and median gender
pay gap information. The mean is our avarage pay. This is calculated by adding up
all our salaries and dividing by the number of colleagues. The median is the middle
value in our pay. This value is calculated by organising all our salaries in order and
picking the middle number.

What does the data tell us?

The pay gap evident below stems mostly from an uneven distribution of men and 
women across two service areas delivered in-house; Property Services and Care 
and Support Services. Property Services contains an over representation of men, 
often in higher paid roles, whilst Care and Support Services contain an over 
representation of women, mostly in lower paid roles.

This is the statutory calculation that we are required to publish. It shows the 
average pay of males is over 20% higher than the average pay of females.

Broadacres does not operate a bonus scheme and therefore the data only 
represents a £20 Christmas voucher paid to all sta(cid:31) and the long service award for 
2016. We are con(cid:30)dent that the long service award is the same for both men and 
women.

The data above illustrates the gender distribution across four equally sized 
quartiles of the business i.e. dividing our sta(cid:31) into 4 equal groups from lowest to 
highest paid. The data shows that Broadacres has more senior men in higher paid 
roles than women and an under representation of men within the lower pay 
quartile. In addition, female workers occupy many of the lowest paid positions, 
such posts including domestic, catering and care sta(cid:31).

The charts shows the percentage of eligible men and women (based on qualifying
length of service 5, 10, 15 and 20 years’ service) who were awarded a length of
service bonus payment in December. There is no di(cid:31)erence in the number of men 
and women who were awarded a bonus, due to all employees also receiving a 
one-o(cid:31) £20 Christmas voucher bonus this year.  

What are we going to do?

At Broadacres we are committed to recruiting the best people, irrespective of 
gender, ethnicity or background.

We strive to achieve an equal distribution of men and women across each quartile.
The planned actions are aimed to improve the gender pay gap and stretch beyond
the next report on 5th April 2018.
  
To improve we have an action plan across the four key areas of pay, progression,
recruitment and (cid:31)exibility.

Pay

Review Broadacres Remuneration Policy by March 2019.

Progression

Provide training/mentoring programmes and talent management in 2018 to help
support women progress in to higher positions within Broadacres and to address
where there is any gender imbalance by March 2019.

Recruitment

By March 2019, we will have reviewed all new job adverts, aiming to attract more 
applications from men and women in underrepresented roles that are 
predominantly male/female.

Flexibility

By March 2019, we will review the opportunities for people to work (cid:29)exibly at all
levels of the organisation to also help women progress in to more senior roles.
