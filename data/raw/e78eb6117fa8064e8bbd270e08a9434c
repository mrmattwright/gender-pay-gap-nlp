and a sales capability in 30 countries

committed to making this happen.

Phil Austin 
CEO, Europe

Our  pay  practices  are  gender 
neutral  and  we  pay  males  and 
females  equally  for  work  of  equal 
value.    Our  gender  pay  gap  results 
in the UK demonstrate that we have 
progress  to  make  in  having  better 
female 
in  more 
senior  roles.  This  report  highlights 
the areas that we will take real and 
measureable action to improve upon 
and  I  am  confident  that  we  will  do 
so  with  fervour  and  commitment.   
I  confirm  that  the  information  and 
data in this report is accurate.

Overview
The UK Government has introduced new reporting regulations which require 
all companies with more than 250 employees to disclose their gender pay 
gap annually from April 2017.

Gender pay gap is the difference in average pay between men and women 
in  a  workplace,  regardless  of  what  jobs  they  do  and  is  expressed  as  a 
percentage of men’s earnings. It is very different from ‘equal pay’ which is 
the difference in pay between a man and a woman who carry out the same 
or similar work.

The gender pay gap figures shown here have been calculated in line with 
the government regulations. They represent the mean and median pay gap 
(based on hourly rates of pay at 5th April 2017) and mean and median bonus 
gap (based on bonuses paid in the 12 months to 5th April 2017). 

What we’ve published
In the UK, Cigna has 2 employing entities with a requirement 
to publish in accordance with the regulations.  These are:

•  Cigna European Services Limited (CESL)

•  Cigna Insurance Services Europe Limited (CISEL)

In  addition  to  reporting  on  these  two  entities,  we  have 
also  taken  the  opportunity  to  comment  here  on  the  consolidated  data 
for both entities.  We believe this consolidated data is a more meaningful 
representation of our UK organisation. 

Our global people strategy utilises a number of key enablers to build our 
talent  and  capability  through  our  Connect  for  Growth  program,  Reward 
for  Contribution,  and  creating  a  positive,  productive  and  inclusive  work 
environment.  As  we  strive  to  close  our  gender  pay  gap,  we  will  look  to 
promote  these  talent  attraction  and  development  programs  to  remove 
potential  barriers  and  create  more  opportunities  for  female  workers  to 
progress.

OUR GENDER PAY GAP

OUR GENDER PAY GAP

Mean and Median Gender Pay Gap

Pay Gap

Mean
22.65%

Median
17.09%

The  above  table  shows  our 
overall  mean  and  median 
gender pay gap as at 5th April 
2017.  

Our  analysis  shows  both  our 
gender pay gaps are driven by 
the  fact  women  hold  a  lower 
proportion  of  more  senior, 
higher paid positions than men.  

As at 5th April 2017 only 36.5% 
of our senior positions were held 
by  women  whilst  58.8%  of  our 
total employees were female.  

Calculation methodology as set 
by the regulations to use hourly 
pay  after  salary  sacrifice  also 
increased  our  gender  pay  gap 
by 2%.  

The mean gender pay gap is 
the difference in average hourly 
pay of male and female employees, 
expressed as a percentage of 
the average hourly pay of male 
employees. 

The median gender pay gap is the 
difference in the midpoint of the 
range of hourly pay for male and 
female employees expressed as a 
percentage of the midpoint of the 
hourly pay of male employees. 

Mean and Median Gender Bonus Gap

 

Bonus Gap

Mean
51.81%

Median
38.31%

 
 
The  above  table  shows  our 
overall mean and median bonus 
pay gap as at 5th April 2017.  In 
accordance  with  the  reporting 
requirements, 
data 
excludes  anyone  who  did  not 
receive a bonus. It does not take 
into  account  pro-rated  bonus 
targets  and  awards  for  part-
time  working,  or  other  factors 
such as individual performance 
and level of contribution.

this 

As well as a lower representation 
of  women  in  our  more  senior 
positions  that  attract  higher 
bonuses,  our  bonus  gap 
is 
further  impacted  by  the  fact 
that  the  majority  of  our  part-
time employees are women.  Of 
the 13.6% part-time employees, 
94.4%  are  female.    If  all  our 
employees  worked 
fulltime, 
with  no  pro-rated  bonus,  our 
gender  bonus  gap  would 
reduce by 6%.

We calculated the mean gender 
bonus gap by calculating  the 
difference in average bonus paid to 
male and female employees. 

The median gender bonus gap 
is calculated by looking at the 
difference in the midpoints of the 
range of bonus pay between our 
male and female populations.

This represents the proportion of men and women in each pay quartile.

•  Recruitment & Selection: More than half of our workforce comprises 
female  employees,  demonstrating  that  our  recruitment  and  selection 
processes are not a barrier for women wanting to join our workforce.

•  Equal pay for equal roles:  Men and women are paid equally for 
doing  equivalent  roles  across  the  organisation.    We  adopt  fair  and 
equitable pay practices and continually monitor to ensure we pay equally 
for the same or similar work activities.

•  Bonus participation:  All  employees  have  an  equal  opportunity  to 
participate in and earn a bonus. We adopt a performance related bonus 
pay approach to ensure individuals, regardless of gender, are rewarded 
for the individual contribution they make to our business.

•  Flexible  Working:  As  noted  above,  many  of  our  workforce  in  the 
UK  take  advantage  of  part-time  working  arrangements  that  suit  their 
individual lifestyle and personal commitments. We strive to be a flexible 
and understanding employer that recognises and celebrates the individual 
circumstances of our employees. 

•  Family Friendly Policies:  Cigna is committed to supporting employees, 
improving their sense of security and helping them  manage their worklife 
balance.  As part of this commitment, Cigna offers enhanced paid Maternity, 
Adoption, Paternity and Caregiver Leave.

UNDERSTANDING OUR 
GENDER PAY GAP

UNDERSTANDING OUR 
GENDER PAY GAP

Where we need to improve
 
Despite our strengths in the areas above, analysis of our gender pay gap 
reporting is telling us that we have a number of common barriers to closing 
our gender pay gap. 

•  Fewer  women  than  men  in  management  and  senior 
positions: Both our gender pay and bonus gaps are mainly driven by 
the fact women hold a lower proportion of senior higher paid positions 
than men.  As of April 2017, more than half (58.8%) of our employees are 
female, yet just 36.5% of more senior positions were held by women.  

•  Higher  proportion  of  women  than  men  in  lower  level 
positions: The disproportionate number of females in senior positions 
is compounded by the fact the majority of our lower paid jobs are held 
by  women,  as  clearly  shown  in  the  split  of  employees  into  the  4  pay 
quartiles.

 

We are committed to closing our gender pay 
gap
 
We  are  passionate  about  building  a  more  diverse  and 
inclusive  workplace  giving  equal  opportunities  to  all 
employees.  We  value  the  differences  employees  bring  to 
the workplace each and every day. 

Our commitment is about ensuring that every member of 
our team, regardless of gender, feels a sense of belonging 
and is able to reach their fullest potential.

We will ensure we are proactive in our approach to closing our gender pay 
gap by: 

•  Continuing  to  work  hard  to  identify  and  understand  the  multiple  and 
interconnected  root  causes  of  our  gender  pay  gap  and  designing  and 
implementing various solutions to tackle these causes.

•  Reviewing our talent management practices, identifying and removing 
potential  barriers  to  progression  and  pro-actively  focusing  on  career 
segments were we have imbalanced representation.

• 

Improving our family friendly policies providing support for parental and 
caregiver leave, and flexible working practices.

•  Developing a diverse and inclusive culture through education and training, 
to raise awareness on all aspects of diversity, including unconscious bias. 

•  Putting  in  place  effective  measurement  tools  to  closely  monitor  these 

practices, and ensure continuous improvement.
