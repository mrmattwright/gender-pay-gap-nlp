2017 UK Gender Pay Gap ReportApril 2018Introduction Palantir is committed to welcoming and supporting individuals from all backgrounds, and to providing  a work environment free of bias. We commend the increased transparency encouraged by the UK  Gender Pay Gap regulations. We believe in data-driven decision-making, and metrics such as these help us understand where we must improve.This calculation is based on bonuses paid in the 12 months prior to 5 April 2017. The discrepancy  in the percentage of employees receiving a (cid:67)onus re(cid:717)ects the greater num(cid:67)er of women who (cid:67)egan wor(cid:76) at (cid:49)alantir (cid:54)(cid:44) in the (cid:67)eginning of (cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:24)(cid:13) and were therefore ineligi(cid:67)le for the (cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:23) annual (cid:67)onus (cid:9)paid in March (cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:24)(cid:10).

The gender (cid:67)onus gap is calculated as the difference in mean and median bonus pay over a 12 month period for men and women. FIG 1.   PAY GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMENFIG 2.

PAY QUARTILESUnderstanding the dataWe are committed to paying every individual fairly, and have designed our compensation practices  to prevent bias with this principle in mind. We review global compensation data quarterly to ensure that employees are paid appropriately based on their role, experience, and performance, regardless of gender. We also provide ongoing trainings for recruiters, hiring managers, and others involved in determining compensation during the hiring process. In addition, we have eliminated the practice of asking candidates about prior salary to help prevent the perpetuation of pay disparities.  (cid:48)ur compensation review process gives us confidence that men and women receive e(cid:82)ual pay for e(cid:82)ual wor(cid:76). (cid:48)ur pay gap instead re(cid:717)ects a separate challenge(cid:27) the uneven distri(cid:67)ution of men and women  in roles across the company. Currently, women are under-represented in technical and business  development roles, which comprise the majority of the upper three pay quartiles of UK employees.  More women hold administrative and operational roles, which are more likely to fall in the lowest pay  (cid:82)uartile. (cid:56)hen those roles are e(cid:89)cluded from the calculations(cid:13) there is no difference in the median hourly pay, while the mean hourly pay for women is actually 2% higher than that of men.We are strongly committed to addressing the unequal distribution of men and women in roles across the company. (cid:56)e’re investing in efforts to recruit(cid:13) develop(cid:13) and advance women across all departments(cid:13)  as a part of our ongoing commitment to attract and retain a more diverse workforce, described  in more detail below.

As Palantir continues to grow, creating a culture of inclusion is even more critical to the success of our business. Here’s what we’re doing to ensure that women thrive in all parts of our organization. These efforts are  part of our broader strategy to increase diversity and inclusivity across Palantir, and to support  underrepresented groups within STEM fields and the tech industry at large. Our employee resource groups and mentoring programs support, advocate for, and celebrate diverse groups across Palantir. In addition to our Women in Technology group, we also have  networks that support Black, Latino/a, and LGBT employees, as well as Palantir parents.All new employees are required to participate in workshops designed to increase  awareness of and empathy for the diverse challenges faced (cid:67)y different groups of employees(cid:13) including but not limited to women in the workplace. We conduct mandatory anti-harassment and anti(cid:14)discrimination training(cid:13) and offer additional training to all employees on issues  such as unconscious (cid:67)ias(cid:13) cultural awareness(cid:13) and inclusivity. (cid:56)e invest in a wide array of (cid:67)enefits to support parents(cid:13) caregivers(cid:13) and families(cid:13) including  support for fertility treatments and discounted access to (cid:67)ac(cid:76)(cid:14)up childcare. (cid:56)e also provide access to nursing rooms and free (cid:67)reast mil(cid:76) shipping and storage to ensure a seamless transition and minimally stressful environment for new parents returning to the wor(cid:76)place. INVESTING IN EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT PALANTIR IS A WELCOMING PLACE TO WORK3•Over the past two years, we have redesigned our recruiting strategy to expand our hiring pipeline and ensure we target a diversity of candidates, particularly for roles within product and business development where women are currently underrepresented. As a data-driven company, our recruiting team regularly reviews outcomes to monitor for bias and assess our progress toward internal goals.We work with organizations such as the Anita Borg Institute to help us nurture diverse talent pools and identify exceptional technologists from underrepresented groups.••••4(cid:56)e sponsor a num(cid:67)er of different initiatives(cid:13) including the (cid:49)alantir (cid:56)omen in Technology  Scholarship(cid:13) to cele(cid:67)rate and support underrepresented populations who are (cid:67)eginning careers in technology.
