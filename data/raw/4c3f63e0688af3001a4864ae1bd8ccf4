Gender Pay Gap report – Kirklees Council 

 

From 2017, any organisation that has 250 or more employees must publish and report specific figures 
about their gender pay gap.  The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men 
and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings.  The gender pay gap information as at 31 March 2017 is 
as follows: 
 
Gender Make-up of the Council 

 

There were 7733 employees in position, 5489 females and 2244 males. 
 

  71%  
Of the Council  
workforce are  
women 
 

 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 

68% 

of the Council’s 
senior management team  (Grade 17+)

The Council grades cover a range of roles from operational (cleaning, home care, refuse collection and 
business support, etc.) to Senior Management. Grades vary according to the level of responsibility that 
employees have. In the lower quartile the Council has introduced a Kirklees Living Wage. All grades have a 
set pay range.  Subject to satisfactory performance, employees are expected to move through the pay 
range for their grade, therefore the longer period of time that someone has been in a grade the more we 
would expect them to earn irrespective of their gender.
