The analysis has helped us to understand the root causes behind our gender pay gap and we can now make some important commitments and find solutions that work for our employees and reflect the customers and communities we serve. The report can be downloaded above. Infographic  Who We Are  CHEP is a global provider of innovative supply chain solutions, tailored to the unique business requirements of our customers. Our solutions and associated services are based on returnable and reusable pooled equipment that are designed to increase performance and lower risk, while improving environmental sustainability. In the UK, our 1,000+ employees and more than 24 million pallets, deliver comprehensive nationwide coverage, serving more than 3,500 customers in the consumer goods, fresh food, beverage, manufacturing and retail sectors. Globally, CHEP has operations in more than 60 countries and is part of the Brambles Group. The CHEP UK business is the focus of this report. The call from government for UK-based companies with more than 250 employees to report on their gender pay gap is something we welcome. We work with a mix of customers across the country, so having a workforce that reflects our customer base enables us to provide better and more relevant services. Reporting on our gender pay gap has provided us with the opportunity to look at our workforce in a different way. Addressing the gender pay gap and why it may exist within our UK organisation isn’t just good business sense it is fundamentally the right thing to do. Businesses with a diverse workforce will instil a long-term culture that truly delivers for customers, whilst enabling employees to express themselves and fulfil their careers to their full potential. Following an extensive review of our employee data, we understand the reasons behind our gender pay gap and we can now make some important commitments to help close it.  Helen Lane  Vice President, Country General Manager UK  "We are committed to creating, sustaining and harnessing the power of a truly diverse and inclusive culture, starting with a more balanced and gender diverse workforce." "I am proud of what our business has already achieved, but I know we can do more. This report highlights some of the first steps we are taking across CHEP UK. We will work hard to address root causes of the gender pay gap and foster a workplace that creates greater opportunities for all employees. We will also work with our broader industry to break down barriers and build future opportunities. My leadership team and I will champion this open and honest discussion and work together to advance our organisation. I confirm the gender pay information and data reported for CHEP UK are accurate as at 5 April 2017." Our Current Workforce The data results of the analysis on our overall workforce show a gender pay gap in favour of women. To help explain these results it is important to understand our business here at CHEP UK. The results are primarily driven by the fact that about 60% of our jobs are plant operative roles, occupied predominantly by men. Female employees mainly work in office, sales or field-based roles. This means the male average pay calculation is spread across the whole organisation and at all levels. The average pay calculation for women on the other hand covers a narrower group of roles within the organisation. The supply chain and logistics industry has a lower representation of females, so as a company and as an industry we need to work together to change this dynamic for the future. Gender diversity has been a key focus area for us and we are proud of the progress we’ve made to date, which is visible in our country leadership team where we have more females than males. We’re committed to making CHEP a great place to work for everyone, and this has been acknowledged by CHEP UK being awarded the Top Employer Certificate by the Top Employers Institute for the third year running. CHEP Employees Infographic  Reporting on our Gender Pay Gap  Equal Pay Statement We always aim to be an equal opportunities employer, and have implemented robust mechanisms into our recruitment, pay and grading structures to ensure pay transparency and consistency. We undertook and implemented job evaluation some years ago across our professional and management roles.This is underpinned by the Hay Methodology and reviewed on a regular basis. We have also undertaken an equal pay audit with the assistance of external experts with regard to our whole workforce in order to ensure that these systems are robust. As a consequence, we are confident that our pay practices are rigorous, fair and transparent. Infographic  Calculating the Mean (average) Gender Pay Gap  The mean gender pay gap is the difference in the average hourly pay for women compared to men, within a company. Infographic  Calculating the Median (middle) Gender Pay Gap  The median gender pay gap represents the middle point of a population. If you separately lined up all the women in a company and all the men, the median pay gap is the difference between the hourly pay rate for the middle woman compared to that of the middle man. Infographic  What do our figures tell us?  Gender split by pay quartile Includes all employees at CHEP UK Ltd, which is made up of the UK country business, Supply Chain and European Head Office. Our findings show there are still opportunities for us to further improve the balance and makeup of our workforce across the organisation, by growing the number of females represented in our supply chain and senior management roles. Gender Pay Gap The statutory figures report a gender pay gap in favour of females for our full employee population. This is primarily driven by the fact that, as previously mentioned, our gender distribution is heavily weighted towards males. The under-representation of females in our plants is consistent with workforce demographics in the wider supply chain and logistics sector. Gender Pay Gap Bonus Pay gap The bonus pay gap results above, reflecting our CHEP UK Workforce, show an overall bonus pay gap in favour of females . This is explained by our workforce demographic and our two types of bonus schemes. Our office, sales and field-based employees are eligible to participate in a bonus scheme that measures financial performance, whereas our plant-based operative roles participate in a bonus scheme linked to individual productivity targets. Bonus Pay Gap Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment Indicates that females are 2.8% more likely to receive a bonus than males. Access to our bonus schemes and amounts paid is gender neutral. The small difference in our bonus gap is attributed to eligibility rules of the schemes. The figures and charts support this where we see a minimal difference in bonus pay-out between males and females. *We can confirm that our figures as of 5 April 2017 have been independently verified by an external advisor. Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment Infographic  Our Commitment  We are focused on targeted actions that will help us improve how we attract, retain and progress all our employees. We continue to drive an environment where learning and development is on everyone’s agenda. We support a truly diverse workforce, and we’re committed to gaining a better understanding of what lies behind some of the barriers we may have. The actions we’re going to take: Our first step is to focus on improving the gender split across our organisation still ensuring, we have the best person for the role We will roll out Diversity & Inclusion workshops across the whole organisation Finally, we will ensure all of our employees have individual development plans that match their career aspirations We already have many good practices in place, including: Inclusion and Diversity Workshops for our leadership team The application of our global gender-neutral pay policy A commitment to a 50/50 gender split with every talent programme we run Being a member of Business in the Community, which supports our journey of continuous improvement And there is more to come: A review of recruitment practices and training for line managers We are introducing anonymised CVs to support equal recruitment opportunities We have partnered with LEAD Europe (Leading Executives Advancing Diversity) which is an organisation that is focussed on advancing women in the retail and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industries  0161 786 0500  Contact Us      Search the site  Go   Industries   Consumer Goods   Retail   Fresh   Bulk Liquid and Dry   Automotive and Industrial   Platforms   Platform Solutions   Pallets   Containers   RPCs   Solutions   Solutions overview   System Wide Solutions   Harvesting, Processing and Warehouse Solutions   Store Solutions   Transportation Solutions   Intercontinental Solutions   Corporate Social Responsibility   About   About Us   History of CHEP   Newsroom   Careers   Investors   Contact Us   Contact Us   Locations   Language/Region   Select region     © 2018 CHEP   Terms of Use   Website Privacy Policy   Brambles           Find CHEP platforms  All countries Argentina Australia Austria Bahrain Belgium Botswana Brazil Bulgaria Canada Chile China Colombia Costa Rica Croatia Czech Republic Denmark Egypt El Salvador Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Guatemala Honduras Hong Kong Hungary India Ireland Italy Jordan Kuwait Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malaysia Mexico Morocco Mozambique Namibia Netherlands New Zealand Nicaragua Norway Oman Peru Poland Portugal Qatar Romania Russia Saudi Arabia Serbia Singapore Slovakia Slovenia South Africa Spain Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Thailand Turkey United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Uruguay Zambia Zimbabwe  All industries Consumer Goods Retail Fresh Automotive and Industrial Bulk Liquid and Dry  All products Containers Pallets RPCs     Please enter your details below First Name: (required)  Your entry is not of the correct length Please enter a correct email address Your entry should not contain any URLS This field is required Last Name: (required)  Your entry is not of the correct length Please enter a correct email address Your entry should not contain any URLS This field is required Email Address: (required)  Your entry is not of the correct length Please enter a correct email address Your entry should not contain any URLS This field is required Company: (required)  Your entry is not of the correct length Please enter a correct email address Your entry should not contain any URLS This field is required Title/Function: Your entry is not of the correct length Please enter a correct email address Your entry should not contain any URLS This field is required Phone (Inc country code): Your entry is not of the correct length Please enter a correct email address Your entry should not contain any URLS This field is required  Are you an existing customer?:    Yes    No    If your download doesn't start shortly please click here   Select language   United Kingdom  English   Done  Not your country or language?
