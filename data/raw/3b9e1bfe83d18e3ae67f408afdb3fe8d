The actual hours worked will vary throughout the year depending on how busy the centres are (the winter months are quieter) but the hours will average out over the course of the year, meaning staff receive a regular monthly salary. Staff work a maximum of 48 hours in any week.    The timetable involves some 12 hour days when group leading, but these are balanced out by shorter days at other times.       Working long days when supervising a 3 day course means that staff get additional days off over the course of the year. All group leader team staff get 6 weeks paid holiday a year but added together with additional days that result from higher hours worked on busy weeks we are able to allocate a total of 12 holiday weeks a year, which generally coincide with school holiday periods.    Staff have the opportunity to request and be given specific days off, subject to general timetable constraints.Staff can also take periods of unpaid leave to travel or do other seasonal work once they have successfully completed their probationary year, before returning to continue employment at Robinwood.
