Premier Oil Plc Gender Pay Gap Report 20181.0 Introduction

The Company

Premier Oil is a global organisation with offices  
in Europe, Asia and South America with 783 
employees worldwide (as at 31 Dec 2017). 
Our business success is dependent on our ability  
to recruit, retain and motivate high quality,  
skilled employees and contractors throughout  
the Organisation and in all our locations. To this  
end, the Company has long been committed to  
the principle of equal opportunity and the 
maintenance of a fair and non-discriminatory  
work environment, with gender parity being  
but one element of a broader global culture  
of diversity and inclusivity. 

What is Gender Pay Gap?
The Gender Pay Gap is the difference  
in pay between male and female 
employees within the company’s UK 
workforce. The legislation requires the 
Company to publish a set of data based 
on certain statistical criteria (explained 
later in the report). The Gender Pay Gap  
is not Equal Pay, which is about a man  
and woman receiving equal pay for the 
same or similar job.

The Gender Pay Gap Reporting  
legislation only covers employees in the 
UK (258 staff), who represent 33% of the 
Company’s global workforce. The UK 
Business Unit based in Aberdeen 
represents 55% of these employees, the 
Falkland Islands Business Unit in London 
9% and the Corporate Head Office in 
London 36%. 

Premier supports this UK government 
initiative and in providing this report also 
welcomes the opportunity to provide 
further narrative around the context of  
our disclosures and importantly to commit 
to actions, both current and future, that 
should promote ongoing sustainable 
improvement, both within Premier and  
our contribution to the Oil and Gas 
industry at large. 

Premier Oil Plc Gender Pay Gap Report 20182.0 The requirements and calculation methodology

Who are the calculations  
based on?
The Regulations require all companies with 
250 or more employees on the snapshot 
date of 05 April 2017 to publish details  
of their gender pay and bonus gap. 

The Company had 255 relevant employees 
on this date.

However, employees on reduced pay  
such as sick pay or maternity leave do  
not count towards the statistical analysis.

Therefore, only 248 employees were 
included in the calculations.

What is included in  
the calculations?
The pay calculations are based on all Pay 
received in the pay period of April 2017. 
This includes all forms of payment, 
excluding pay relating to redundancy /
termination of employment, pay in lieu  
of leave or the value of benefits which  
are not in the form of cash. Salary  
Sacrifice Schemes are also excluded  
from Pay.

The bonus pay calculations are based  
on all bonus pay received during the bonus 
pay period which is the 12 months’ prior to 
and ending with the snapshot date.  

This includes the Company’s annual 
discretionary bonus scheme and long term 
incentive plans. Qualifying pay for share 
schemes, which all Premier employees 
participate in, is any vested award during 
the snapshot date.

What are the calculations?
There are two pay calculations which  
show the difference between a man  
and woman’s hourly rate. The 'median' 
calculation looks at the mid-point 
difference and is therefore not affected  
by extreme values, whereas the 'mean'  
is an average calculation and includes  
all values.

The ‘mean’ percentage is based on  
the difference between the average  
hourly pay for men and women within  
the workforce.

The ‘median’ percentage represents  
the middle point of the workforce.  
If you organised all of the men and all  
of the women in order of pay, it would  
be the difference between the hourly  
pay rate for the middle woman  
compared to that of the middle man.

The pay quartiles show the percentage  
of men and women in each group, which  
is an equal quarter of all employees.  
Each quartile contains 62 employees.

It can be seen by the Pay Quartiles  
that whilst Premier has a significant 
Gender Pay Gap, this is largely skewed 
by the demographics, where the 
majority of individuals in the top two  
pay quartiles are men in the more  
senior professional level grades.
The Oil and Gas Industry has traditionally 
been male dominated and this is reflected 
in our UK workforce where 71% of our 
employees are male and 29% are female.

Overall, females are underrepresented  
at senior and professional levels within  
the UK organisation, specifically in 
technical disciplines. Where we have 
females at manager or professional levels 
this tends to be in non-technical / support 
areas such as Finance, Legal, HR and 
Supply Chain. It should be noted however 
that this experience is not common  
to all Premier Oil entities. For example,  
56% of the Premier Oil Vietnam 
organisation are female and within  
that women represent 53% of the 
management grades. 

Our offshore workforce which represents 
7% of our employees, is all male. These 
roles traditionally attract additional 
premiums due to the working environment 
and will have a higher hourly pay rate.

Of our onshore technical roles which 
represent 36% of our workforce, only  
11% of these roles are female. These 
disciplines include Subsurface, Drilling  
and Engineering. 

This is generally representative of the  
Oil and Gas Industry as a whole.

‘The UK has the lowest proportion of 
female engineers in the European Union, 
less than one in ten engineering 
professionals is a woman’ (Perkins Review 
of Engineering Skills Nov 2013)

To conclude, the challenge we face is 
gender parity, within our organisational 
structure, where we need to ensure 
stronger representation at the more senior 
professional levels going forward. This 
challenge has not been helped in recent 
years due to the difficulty in promoting 
such change in a retrenched market, with 
very little organisational turnover and few 
growth and development opportunities, 
as we have focused on cost reduction and 
balance sheet recovery. However, actions 
listed on the following page, both current 
and going forward are designed to enable 
positive change and sustainable 
improvement.
