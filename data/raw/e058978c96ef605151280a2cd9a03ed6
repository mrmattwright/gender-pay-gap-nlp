Booker’s commitment to our customer is ‘choice up, prices down and better service’ and they tell us that 

the  best  thing  about  Booker  is  our  people.    We  are  resolute  in  creating  an  atmosphere  in  which  all 

colleagues, regardless of their background, reach their full potential. 

 

We are pleased to see our Gender Pay Gap is below the UK median for our core Booker business, however 

we know we need to do more to reduce this. We see two key factors contributing to the pay gap: We have 

more males than females working unsocial hours that attract shift premiums, and secondly we have a 

lower number of females than males in senior roles.  It is important to note that the hourly rate for our 

hourly  paid  colleagues  is  the  same  regardless  of  gender,  for  the  same  role.  We  see  two  key  factors 

contributing to the bonus gap: We have more females than males working part-time hours, which results 

in a lower pro-rated bonus, and secondly we have a lower number of females than males in senior roles. 

 

We understand we have more work to do here and are committed to making progress. Booker is proud 

of  our  people  and  we  believe  having  a  diverse  and  inclusive  team  is  essential  to  help  our  customers 

prosper both now and in the future.
