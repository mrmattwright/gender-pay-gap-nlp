Foreword 

Our  people  are  at  the  heart  of  everything  we  do,    with  our  culture  built  on  fairness, 
consistency  and  nurturing  talent.    At  Amaris,  we  have  1,800  employees  working  across 
the UK and a further 60 employees based in Ireland where we apply the same approach.  
As  a  committed  equal  opportunities  employer,  we  welcome  the  Government’s 
introduction  of  the  Gender  Pay  Gap  Reporting  obligations  which  require  private  and 
voluntary sector organisations in the  UK with 250 or more employees to publish gender 
pay gap information about their business. 

 
We  work  hard  to  promote  equality and  diversity  amongst  our  workforce,  and  to  attract  and  retain  the 
best  talent  regardless  of  gender  or  identity.    Women  account  for  51%  of  our  overall  workforce,  and 
occupy 40% of Management positions.  
 
Our  results  show  that  whilst  we  compare  very  favourably  against  the  UK  hospitality  sector  averages, 
there  is  more  we  can  do  in  the  future.    The  figures  also  reflect  the  fact  that,  in  line  with  the  industry 
norm, we have a higher proportion of women than men working flexible part-time hours. 
 
Regardless, there will always be more we can do and we look forward to taking further steps to close our 
gender pay gap as we strive to meet best practice.

According to the Office of National Statistics, the UK’s current median hourly gender pay gap is 18.4% whilst the mean figure 
is 17.4%. We are pleased to report that our median and mean hourly gender pay gaps are therefore significantly better than 
the UK average. Our median hourly gender pay gap in particular, which we believe is the most accurate representation of 
hourly rates of pay, shows little difference between our male and female members of staff.  
 
Our gender bonus pay gap reflects that we have a higher proportion of males in senior roles as opposed to females in junior 
part time roles.  The small gap that does exist is explained by the fact that these junior positions are not eligible to receive a 
bonus payment.

Our Future 

Although we are proud of the positive progress we are making, we believe there is more we can 
do to  ensure  we are creating meaningful opportunities for all within our workplace.   We have 
more  male  colleagues  in  senior  manager  roles  and  as  per  the  industry  norm,  more  females 
working part time. 
 
We therefore aim to increase the amount  of female leaders  within the  organisation at General 
Manager  level  and  above.    We  will do  this  through  development,  succession  and  mentoring  to 
ensure there is a talent pipeline into senior management roles. 
 
We will encourage an environment where everyone has the opportunity to work flexibly (not just 
women).    We  will  ensure  awareness  is  raised  amongst  our  current  workforce  and  at  all 
recruitment opportunities. 
 
I confirm the information contained within this report is accurate.
