Fenland is a diverse and vibrant district, made up of four market towns supporting their rural hinterland. We are proud of this diversity and recognise that it is one of our district's great strengths. We have a longstanding commitment to celebrating diversity, building strong communities and improving quality of life. Our vision for Diversity and Equality is to "promote equal life outcomes for all." We also invite people to get involved with projects through our Diverse Communities Forum . What is Equality and Diversity? The Equality Act 2010 provides the basic framework of protection from discrimination, victimisation and harassment. It replaces all existing anti-discrimination laws (such as the Disability Discrimination Act 1995) and extends protection across 'protected characteristics.' These are race, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief, gender reassignment and pregnancy and maternity. The Act applies across services and public functions, premises, work, education, associations and transport provision. The public sector equality duty came into from April 2011. This contains the general duty (replacing the previous race, gender and disability duties) and requires local authorities (including other public sector bodies) to have due regard for the need to: eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation advance equality of opportunity between different groups foster good relations between different groups More information on the Equality Act and the public sector equality duty can be found on the Government Equalities Office and Equality and Human Rights Commission websites. Equality analysis As a council we are required to publish evidence of any equality analysis we've done to assess the affect of equality in what we do. We use our Customer (Equality) Impact Assessments to do this. We have published our Annual Equality Report and Equality Impact Assessments (EIAs) to do this. Equality pledge We are just one of many organisations who has signed up to the Cambridgeshire Equality Pledge . This commits us to appreciate and value to benefits that different communities contribute to Fenland and the surrounding region. Any organisation or individual can sign up and get involved. Hate Crime Hate crime in any form is wrong. It can be because of hatred on the grounds of your race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability. If hate crime happens to you or someone you know, report it. You can do this online , by contacting the Police or the council. For further information email diversity@fenland.gov.uk.       Diverse Communities Forum  We want to provide services that meet the needs of everyone in the community. Our Forum particularly looks at the needs of the whole community in relation to diversity and community make-up of the area.
