Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
 
Under new legislation that came into force in April 2017, UK employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish 
their gender pay gap in order to show how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. 
 
Gender Pay Figures 
 
The information below shows the median and mean gender pay gap and bonus pay gap for Akari Care Limited (Akari) based on

Understanding the Gap 
 
Akari’s workforce is made up of significantly more female than male staff and Akari’s lower paid roles including domestic and 
care staff are predominantly undertaken by females.  
 
At the reporting date, Akari employed 283 males and 1,560 females. This profile is common across the social care sector with a 
higher proportion of female employees.  
 
There represents an overall average (mean) pay gap of 9.95%. This difference only arises as a result of the inclusion of the 
statutory directors of Akari who are all male. Excluding the statutory directors the average (mean) pay gap is 0.12%.  
 
I have reviewed the information and confident of the accuracy and completeness. This report confirms that male and female 
employees are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across Akari.
