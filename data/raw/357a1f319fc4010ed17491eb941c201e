We are delighted that our gender pay gap is so low compared to the national average, (18%, published by the government in November 2016) and compares well within our sector, because women represent such a high percentage of our workforce.  77% of our employees are female, including our CEO, Gill Morbey, and women make up more than half of our workforce at every level through our organisation , from the Executive Team through each of the pay quartiles which we have reported in our gender pay gap data for April 2017.  Our median gender pay gap is very low at 1.9% (equivalent to 16p per hour) and we have a small mean gender pay gap of 7.9% (equivalent to 82p per hour). This reflects that in April 2017 there was a slightly higher proportion (5%) of men in the upper quartiles of the organisation than the lower quartiles, though the majority of our employees are female across all quartiles of the organisation.  Sense is committed to equality of opportunity, and promoting and celebrating the diversity of staff, volunteers and the people we work with. Everyone's contribution is valued and we ensure they are given the opportunity to realise their potential.  We promote equality and diversity in all that we do and we uphold equality and diversity in our employment policies, procedures and behaviours.  We are confident that we pay our employees equally for doing the same or similar work and have a pay grading structure in place across our organisation to ensure this.  Our values based recruitment practices help us to recruit a diverse and talented workforce and we are actively working to attract and retain the best talent into support roles at Sense. Equally, it is important to us that our leadership team reflects our diversity and this commitment shapes our approach to recruiting and developing employees into leadership roles.  We will continue to monitor and report our progress. We are committed to eliminating the gender pay gap. We will continue to champion opportunity for everyone and grow our diverse and talented team.
