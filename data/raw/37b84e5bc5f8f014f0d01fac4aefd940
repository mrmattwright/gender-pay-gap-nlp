The Trust’s key objective, as set out in its Articles of Association, is to advance for the public benefit education in the United Kingdom.  Since its formation in July 2011, the Trust has grown from a single academy and is now responsible for a junior and two secondary schools in the Borough. It is committed to providing the best possible education for the young people in its care.  Although each school retains its unique identity, the Trust seeks to deliver consistently high standards of education by drawing upon the shared experience of its teaching and support staff as well as executive leadership, local governors and trustees.  The Trust’s schools deliver a broad and balanced curriculum experience and pupils and students are encouraged to reach their potential through a variety of pathways to ensure each individual can flourish.  Applications to join the Trust will be considered from schools when there is positive support from the school's Governing Body and Leadership and where there is mutual benefit.
