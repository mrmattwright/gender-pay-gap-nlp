This is the Company’s gender pay gap report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, at this point Swift Group Ltd employed 1187 employees and 100 of them were women.          Pay Information      Mean Gender Gap  18.96%      Median Gender Gap  27.59%      Bonus Payment  Not applicable, the Company does not pay bonus payments          Proportion of men and women in each quartile band            Band A  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile       Band B  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile but at or below the median       Band C  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile       Band D  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile      The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.          Encouraging women into manufacturing       Swift have undertaken several initiatives to encourage women into manufacturing and engineering, including apprenticeships and being one of the four founding members of WiME (Women in Manufacturing and Engineering – Yorkshire & Humber Region). Two of our recent female recruits working in manufacturing operations came to us via our involvement with WiME, which has included careers events. As this progresses our recruits are used as case studies to show female pathways into Manufacturing in both WiME promotional publications and a new national schools careers publication (Your Future Now).        We work actively with schools in the Hull and East Riding areas to promote careers and have joined with the careers and enterprise council to further this by partnering with a nearby all girls secondary school – Beverley High School. This serves to help us demonstrate the breadth of roles our industry can off er to females and enable us to support local community and schooling projects.       Swift Group Ltd is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.
