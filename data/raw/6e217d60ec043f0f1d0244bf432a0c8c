GENDER PAY GAP 
2017

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?
The Gender Pay Gap is a term defined by the UK Government that measures the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across the
whole business. The Gender Pay Gap does not compare the pay received by men and women for doing the same job; this is known as Equal Pay.

The UK Government requires all UK businesses with over 250 employees to publish data about their Gender Pay Gap, starting April 2017.
