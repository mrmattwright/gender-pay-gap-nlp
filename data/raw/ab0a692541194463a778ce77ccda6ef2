Uniper  
2018 Gender 
Pay Gap

The data provided within this statement covers our two legal 
entities employing 250 people or more: Uniper UK Ltd and 
Uniper Technologies Ltd.

What is the Gender Pay Gap? 
The gender pay gap is an average difference between male and female employees pay regardless of the 
actual job that they do. The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay ensures that men and 
women receive the same pay for carrying out the same work or equivalent work. The gender pay gap is 
reported on both a mean (average) and median (mid-point on a distribution) basis. Gender Pay reporting 
legislation requires us to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is 
between our male and female employees.

What are the reasons for our Gender Pay Gap?
There are a number of reasons for our gender pay gap.
Primarily it is due to the low representation of females in our organisation. We also have a lack of women 
in senior roles. In our sector we have the lowest percentage of female engineering professionals in Europe. 
We still have difficulty attracting females into STEM based roles. This is particularly evident in Uniper 
Technologies Ltd, which predominantly delivers specialist engineering services.

What action are we taking? 
We recognise that we need to encourage more females into our organisation and the energy sector and we 
are committed to promoting more females into senior roles to redress the under representation at this level.
Uniper, at group level, has voluntarily signed up to an external Diversity Charter within Germany and has 
established a Diversity Working Group internally across all countries. 
This is sponsored by a board member and an ambassador network has been set up to develop measures  
to increase diversity and inclusion awareness across the group. The Uniper Diversity Improvement Plan 
2018 – 2020 contains measures for addressing gender inequality throughout the whole organisation. 
Our organisation already has a range of policies in place to ensure males and females are treated equally 
and with dignity at work. Our Flexible Working policy, the Carers Passport scheme and a Career Break 
policy are all available to all of our employees regardless of their gender. We use the HAY role evaluation 
methodology to score our jobs across all grades to ensure our systems of pay are fair and consistent. 
All of our recruitment and selection is based on an objective analysis and definition of the abilities, skills, 
knowledge and experience required for the job. 
Uniper has joined the Women’s Engineering Society to develop external networking opportunities with 
professional female engineers. In addition Uniper has signed up to the POWERful Women pledge which  
is a network showcasing female leadership potential in the UK’s energy sector.
