 

Burlington Care Ltd’s Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

Burlington Care provides provision on nursing, residential and domiciliary care with centralised 
management, maintenance and administration functions. 

Burlington’s overall workforce is 85% female and 15% male which is in line with the care sector’s 
industry norm. 

We are confident that both male and female employees are paid equally for doing the same job 
within the organisation as pay rates are based on job type. Burlington does however have a slightly 
higher male to female ratio in the upper quartile mainly due to maintenance staff, attributable to 
female skill shortages in these areas nationally.   

The Figures 

 

The Mean difference between male and female pay is 4.29% with male staff being the higher 
earners. 

The Median difference between male and female pay is 0.40% with male staff being the higher 
earners. 

Burlington did not make any bonus payments to any staff male or female during the reporting 
period.

Male  19.14% 

Female 87.08% 
Female 86.60% 
Female 86.54%

The Care Home sector predominantly employs a female workforce. Burlington is no exception to this 
although it must be pointed out that it is the ability to perform the job that is the main employment 
criteria.
