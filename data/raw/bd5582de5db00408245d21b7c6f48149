Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employees data. This data is taken from a specific snapshot date of 5th April each year. We are now required to publish the results from 5th April 2017 on our own website and the government website.  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace  the balance of male and female employees at different levels  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.   The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap. You can read the ForFarmers Gender Gap Report here .  You can find the ForFarmers data on the government site (type in ForFarmers in the search bar on this page).
