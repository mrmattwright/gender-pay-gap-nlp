Love Independence   There’s no place like home  We know that people would often rather be in their own homes, but need support to live an independent life. That’s where Mediline comes in – we provide high-quality, professional support workers and nursing staff to support individuals in their own home.  Flexible around you  Our services are extremely flexible, we can support you on a full or part-time basis, or even just occasionally. Whether it’s to cover holidays or give family members a well-earned break, we can provide care support to suit your needs.

Wonderful.   CLIENT:   CARRER: Fiona Collins      Live-in support   Around the clock  Some people require around the clock support and companionship. It can help them feel safer knowing that someone is on call at all times. We can provide flexible, individual support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to enable you to live your life with more independence.  Long or short-term  Care services can be provided on a long or short-term basis to meet your personal requirements. We tailor your support to suit your exact personal situation and involve you in all steps along the way, creating your personalised support plan. Or if you prefer, you can just sit back and let the experienced Mediline care team take care of everything.         Personal and domestic support   Personal support  Our friendly, professional staff can support every aspect of daily life in the home. It is important to us that our clients retain their dignity, so we help with all personal hygiene requirements such as bathing, washing hair, shaving, oral hygiene, using the toilet and incontinence care.  Mobility & Medication  We can help clients get in and out of bed (using a hoist if necessary), support clients with mobility problems and help with dressing. We also support in the use of surgical appliances and the administration of medicines.  Domestic Support in your home  We help our clients to manage everyday tasks around the house. This can include assisting with light housework, meal preparation, help with eating and laundry.           Respite care & sitting service    Carer Relief Looking after a member of the family who needs constant care can be very demanding. If you are supporting someone with learning or physical difficulties or dealing with ongoing poor health, being able to take a break can prove a real tonic, for both you and the person you care for.

We provide respite care from a few hours during the day to a full week’s cover for a family holiday. You can rest assured that your loved one is being fully cared for by expert carers or nurses and enjoy your break or holiday.  Companionship For some people, having a live in or part time companion can make a real difference to their life. We believe that human contact has a very positive impact on personal wellbeing for individuals that could otherwise be isolated and alone.

Knowing that someone is on hand to help with all matters of daily life, or even just be there for a friendly chat whenever you need them ensures a strong feeling of security.  Night time support We provide night support or night time care for anyone who may need assistance during the night. This can be really useful for people who are managing the care needs of a family member during waking hours, but need to have their rest time during the night.

Our night sitters are experienced care workers who will stay close to the client whilst they sleep. They are there to deal with any issues that arise during the night and provide assistance in the morning with washing, dressing and breakfast.           Specialism & continuing health care   Mediline provides experienced, professional support workers and nurses to meet virtually every need. We are committed to the ongoing specialised training of our support workers and ensure that the highest standards are maintained, through the clinical governance provided through their qualified nursing staff.  Examples of support  Palliative care Spinal injuries Learning disabilities Autism Epilepsy Cerebral palsy Parkinson’s disease Dementia Brain injury        Support within the community    Access local social
& sport activities: Many of our clients want to retain their independence and not become isolated within their own homes. So we encourage them to engage with their local communities, supporting them where necessary

Our staff will help identify the activities that are available within a community and make their clients aware of them. These can include sporting activities, college courses, lunch clubs and befriending services. We can also provide transport and accompany clients when required.  Holiday support: It is often difficult for those in need of care to be able to take a holiday easily. Even managing the travel arrangements can be too difficult for family members to cope with and often there is no certainty of care or nursing facilities on arrival.

We offer a complete solution through our holiday help service. We can provide care or nursing staff to travel with the client and stay with them throughout the duration of the holiday. As well as holidays in the UK we are experienced in providing care support or nursing services for trips abroad.  Access employment
& college placements: Many of our clients want to pursue a career or further their education, so we support them by identifying what opportunities are available within their local communities. We can also provide transport and attend their workplaces or training centres when required, enabling them to achieve goals and make positive changes to their lives.
