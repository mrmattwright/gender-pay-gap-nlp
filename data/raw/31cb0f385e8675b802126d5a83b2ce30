Gender Pay Gap 

Report 2017

As an employer with over 250 employees, Truro School is required to submit a Gender Pay Gap report on its website and on 
the Government's online reporting service by 4th April 2018. The data below is correct as at 5th April 2017, and is based on 
436 employees, of which 41% are male, and 59% are female.  

In accordance with regulations, we are asked to publish certain data:
1) The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay between male and female employees,
2) The difference between the median hourly rate of pay between male and female employees,
3) The proportion of male and female employees in each of four equal pay quartiles.

The School does not pay bonuses, so the requirement to report on bonuses does not apply.

Truro School is committed to ensuring that all its staff receive equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. Both male and 
female staff have the ability to progress along an incremental pay scale that rewards them for their professional performance, 
contribution to the School and experience. Pay is regularly reviewed and benchmarked on both a local and national basis to 
ensure everyone is paid according to the value and complexity of their work. 

As a result, the pay gap at Truro School is almost negligible with regards to both the mean and median calculations as 
evidenced in the data above.
