A total of 756 workers were 
categorised as “relevant employees” 
and used in the reporting of bonus 
pay gap statistics. Of these 756 
employees, 635 (84%) are male, and 
121 (16%) are female.

720 employees were classified as 
“full-pay relevant employees” and 
were used in the reporting of hourly 
pay gap statistics.  Of these 720 
employees, 619 (86%) are male and 
101 (14%) are female. 

At Grundon, we strive to ensure that we have a workforce that reflects the 
diversity of the local communities in which we operate and we are committed 
to achieving equality and diversity by ensuring that we employ the best people 
with the appropriate skills, qualifications, aptitude and attitude.  Once employed, 
we want to ensure that our employees are able to reach their full potential, and 
we are confident that our Gender Pay and Gender Bonus Gap does not stem 
from paying males and females differently for the same or equal work.

GENDER PAY GAP

We are pleased to report that at 9% our Mean Gender Pay Gap is considerably 
lower than the reported October 2017 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual 
Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) of 17.4%, and our Median Gender Pay Gap of 
7.6%, lower that the October 2017 ONS ASHE figures of 18.4%

GENDER BONUS GAP

We reward our employees with bonus payments in a number of ways.

We operate a discretionary annual bonus which is paid to qualifying employees 
based on company performance. This explains why a large proportion of our 
employees were paid bonus in the twelve months prior to the snapshot date of 5th 
April 2017. The way in which this bonus is paid is applied fairly across all roles.

The proportion of employees awarded bonuses in 2016/17 was:

91.8% Men

81.8% Women

Where an employee did not earn any bonus in 2016/17, this was due to the 
qualification rules of the scheme, which are generally service related.

Other bonus payments are made up of either 
commission, which is paid to our Sales team, or 
weekly bonuses, which feature heavily in the overall 
pay structure for our LGV Drivers, of whom 99.6% 
are male and form 39% of our overall workforce. 
According to the Road Haulage Association, the UK 
has a reported shortage of 50,000 LGV Drivers, and 
we therefore believe that the bonus schemes that 
we apply to our LGV Drivers is fair and appropriate in 
order to attract and retain employees in these roles.

Bonus Pay

While we acknowledge that our Bonus Pay Gap is higher than the ONS ASHE 
October 2017 reported figures of 71% (mean) and 44.1% (median), we are absolutely 
confident that bonus rules and entitlements are applied to men and women 
equally based on the role that they are carrying out.
