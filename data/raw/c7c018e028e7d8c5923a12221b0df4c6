 

Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust (CMAT) - Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2017 / 2018 

Below is an overview of the key information that Gender Pay Gap Reporting has shown for our trust, 
looking at all CMAT employees on 31st March 2017. 

The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men 
and women. This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings. 

CMAT Hourly Rate Pay Gap Mean, Median and Pay Quartiles 

The key statistics  

Mean and Median: 

Mean Pay gap – Females hourly rate is 18.6% less than males 

Median pay gap – Females hourly rate is 35.4% less than males 

Quartiles: 

 
 
Q1 (lower Salaries) 
Q2 
Q3 
Q4 (highest salaries) 

 

The central reasons for this are: 

 

Male 

 

25.1% 
16.9% 
26.1% 
36.2% 

Female 

 

74.9% 
83.1% 
73.9% 
63.8% 

  The majority of trust staff are female: 320 out of our 1229 employees (26%) are male.  
  The highest earning quartile of trust staff contains a larger proportion of males (36%) than 

would be expected from the overall gender balance.  The majority of these are in higher 
teaching and leadership roles.  

  A smaller proportion of the lower paid roles, mostly support staff roles, are taken by males 

(Quartile 2, 17% male) than would be expected in comparison to the overall gender balance. 

  The data, which compares two different groups of employees, with unique terms and 

conditions of pay, shows a changed picture when these two groups of staff are looked at 
separately. 

It is predominantly this difference that drives the gender pay gap in the trust. 

We need to understand why there is a larger proportion of males in quartile 4.  If there are barriers 
that are identified to a greater representation of female staff in these roles, the trust is committed 
to removing them. 

We recognise that our 2017 data indicates that the gender pay gap in our trust is mostly found in our 
secondary schools.  We will undertake analysis to understand why this has come about. 

We have further reviewed the gender pay gaps within our different employee sectors – please see 
section 2 of this report. 

The next step in further understanding the gap and addressing it will be to compare the next set of 
data (in March 2018) to look for any alterations in the picture and to assess trends within both the 
wider sector and within the trust. 

Further analysis of the reported data: 

The graphs below, demonstrate the mean and median salaries for men, women and all staff to show 
a comparison of how far apart male and female are from the overall average.

The table below represents the 4 pay quartiles, Q1 – relates to the 25% of employees with the 
lowest hourly rates up to Q4 with the 25% of employees with the highest hourly rates. 

Quartile 4, the highest salaries, has the highest percentage of male employees, whereas the Quartile 
2 has the lowest percentage of male employees.  Both of these are approximately 10% different to 
the expected 25% that would reflect the overall gender balance within the trust.

Bonus Pay 

There is very little bonus pay at CMAT.  The pie charts below show the percentage of males and 
females across the whole trust receiving bonus pay in 2017.

There was very little difference with the regards to the mean and median % gaps, with the median 
pay gap being 0% and the mean pay gap showing female bonus is 9.1% less than males. 

 

Section 2: Further Investigation 

As a responsible employer, we decided to investigate our data further.  Whilst, we are obliged to 
report our data in line with Government requirements, we do believe that it would be more 
meaningful to compare like with like ( that is support staff with support staff and teachers with 
teachers)  The data that is published compares data for employees with different sets of Terms and 
Conditions (Hours, working weeks and pay scales).  Therefore we have carried out the anaylsis 
looking at: 

1.  Teachers as a group 

The main focus is in our secondary schools.   
On the day of the snapshot, the very small number of male primary teachers employed (1) 
made meaningful comparisons impossible.

The vast majority of quartile 4 roles (higher paid) within CMAT are teaching roles (The transition into 
the Upper Pay Spine broadly marks the transition point).   

The mean and median salaries for teachers in primary schools are lower than those in secondary 
schools.  The table below illustrates how this difference accentuates the gender pay gap for teachers 
within CMAT.

However, it is most noticeable that the number of males and females on the leadership spine in a 
CMAT secondary school was the same: 33 of each gender.   

The gender balance of Principals is also not in keeping with either the gender balance of CMAT staff 
in total, nor of the teachers in the secondary phase with 5 male Principals and only 1 female.   

We expect this imbalance to reduce over time as we embark on developing an internal leadership 
scheme to assist with securing headship and senior leadership posts. 

The trust will also conduct an analysis of the impact of maternity leave and part-time status on pay 
progression; the balance of staff holding TLR (Teaching and Learning Responsibility) and the timing 
of staff progression to the leadership team.

Median Pay Gap – the female hourly

The data for support staff demonstrates that the gender gap is relatively small or does not exist.  
This reflects the application of the job evaluation scheme that is adhered to by CMAT as agreed with 

Trade Unions.  Across the support staff pay quartiles, females have the higher percentage of roles, 
including the highest pay quartile where females occupy over 80% of posts. 

Next steps 

The gender gap analysis has been a useful and meaningful exercise for us to undertake.  The data 
has given us a starting point and highlighted areas which will require further analysis, with the focus 
on closing our gender pay gap.  The trust has grown and evolved since the data snapshot and 
therefore it is essential that we have an up to date current picture.  Work will commence on this in 
May 2018.
