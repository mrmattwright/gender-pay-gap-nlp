Gloucestershire Gender Pay Gap Report for the Year 2016-2017www.gloucestershire.police.ukGender Pay Gap Summary  
Last year the Government introduced world-leading legislation that made it statutory for organisations with 
250 or more employees to report annually on their gender pay gap. Constabularies are covered by the 
Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which came into force on 31 
March 2017. 

These regulations underpin the Public Sector Equality Duty and require the relevant organisations to publish 
their gender pay gap data by 30 March 2018 and then annually, including mean and median gender pay 
gaps; the mean and median gender bonus gaps; the proportion of men and women who received bonuses; 
and the proportions of male and female employees in each pay quartile. 

The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men 
and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people 
unequally because they are a man or a woman. 

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. 
It compares the hourly rates of pay and any bonuses staff may receive by gender, seeking to expose any 
imbalance.

We will use the results of the report to assess;

 levels of gender equality in our workplace
 balance of male and female staff at different levels
 and how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded

This report sets out where Gloucestershire Constabulary fulfils the data reporting requirements, analyses the 
figures in more detail and sets out what we are doing to close the gender pay gap within the organisation.

Steps will be taken, where possible, to minimise or readdress any identified inequalities going forward.

On the snapshot date of 31 March 2017 the number of full-time relevant employees was 1883 in total 
(police officers and police staff). Of these staff 1071 were male and 812 were female.

Gloucestershire Gender Pay Gap Report for the Year 2016-2017www.gloucestershire.police.ukBase Pay
The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly rate of pay for men and women.

The median gender pay gap is the value separating the higher half of the data sample from the lower half.  
It may be considered as the middle value.

Officers and Staff combined
Mean is 10.5% 

Median is 9.1%

Police Officers
Mean is 3.7%

Median is 0.6%

Police Staff
Mean is 6.3%

Median is 2.0%

Analysis of Base Pay 
There are three principal reasons for the pay difference in the overall figures. Firstly, there are a higher 
proportion of males in the lowest paid officer ranks. Secondly, there are a higher number of males in 
technical police staff roles (e.g. ICT) and thirdly there is a greater proportion of the female workforce in less 
senior police staff roles.

While these figures compare favourably with the UK’s national average gender pay gap for the public 
sector of 13.3%, our figures highlight that there is more that we can do to ensure that female careers are 
progressing in the organisation, particularly with police officers.

The mean and median figures for police officers and police staff does not add up to the combined figures, as the percentages are 
calculated on different data sets.

Gloucestershire Gender Pay Gap Report for the Year 2016-2017www.gloucestershire.police.ukAnalysis for Salary Quartile Bands
The figures show that female police officers are not progressing to the higher officer ranks and as such we 
need to do more to support female police officer’s career progression.

Although there is a higher percentage of female police staff in the lower quartile pay band the split does 
even out through the other quartiles. This demonstrates that career progression is taking place for female 
police staff and/or females are being recruited to jobs with salaries in the upper quartiles albeit that the gap 
between genders is greater in the lower quartile.

Overall, the high quartile salary band is dominated by male staff, (73%), which indicates that they are 
the highest earners in the Constabulary. However, when the data for police officers and police staff are 
separated out it is evident that the disparity is caused by the low number of female offices in the higher 
ranks.

Gloucestershire Gender Pay Gap Report for the Year 2016-2017www.gloucestershire.police.ukAnalysis of Bonus Payments
Bonus Payments are awarded to officers under Police Regulations for ‘occasional work of outstandingly 
demanding, unpleasant or important nature’ and allow between £50 and £500 to be paid. 

Police staff bonuses are paid by way of honorarium payments for temporary additional duties or 
responsibilities with the amount being calculated based on the level of additional work or increased 
responsibility.

The figures show that there is a marked disparity in the number of bonuses being paid to males and females 
which is due to the high number of male officers receiving a bonus compared to female officers.

A reason for this difference may be due to the majority of payments being made at constable rank, of which 
there are more males. In addition there are circumstances where particular skills attract a bonus payment, 
e.g. body recovery, these officers are predominantly male.

Gloucestershire Gender Pay Gap Report for the Year 2016-2017www.gloucestershire.police.ukThe data contained in this report show that further work is required to close the gap further particularly with 
the under-representation of females at higher police ranks. 

Mentoring, reverse mentoring and tailored support for those considering promotion are among the initiatives 
that will be addressed in the next 12 months.

There will be further opportunity to provide unconscious bias training across the Constabulary as well as 
other CPD initiatives as part of the Supportive Leadership Programme.

Bonus payments, honorarium payments and other forms of reward and recognition are currently being 
reviewed. This data will be used to inform the review in order to address the disparity between the number 
of bonus being afforded to male officers compared to female officers.

The Constabulary is committed to reporting what we are doing to reduce the gender pay gap and the 
progress that we are making on an annual basis.
