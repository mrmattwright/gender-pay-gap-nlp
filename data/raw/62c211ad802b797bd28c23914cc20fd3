The future of our business depends on our ability to provide innovative and intelligent content management and localization solutions to our customers, which can only happen if we recognize and harness the most diverse range of ideas, perspectives, thinking, knowledge, experiences and skills, from across the different cultures and backgrounds within SDL. This diversity also contributes to greater team synergy, innovation and productivity within and across internal teams. As part of our drive to promote equality, SDL has reported its UK Gender pay Gap within our first Gender Pay Gap Report. While each team has different factors affecting the composition of the workforce, our approach is to address this with a coordinated approach. We will take steps to close our pay gap by ensuring equal pay for all colleagues with similar skills, enabling a flexible working and professional growth and fairly develop everybody’s talent to ensure career progression, right across the organization.
