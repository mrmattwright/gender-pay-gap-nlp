This is clearly not reflective of society today and we need to help change this perception. The recruitment and career progression of our colleagues has and always will be based on ability and experience rather than gender. As a business, we welcome the Gender Pay Gap reporting, which we will carry out annually and will continue to encourage a balanced workforce."
