WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY  GAP?
By April 2018, any organisation that has 250 or more employees must publish and report  
specific figures about their gender pay gap. 

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of all of the men  
in the business and all of the women in the business, expressed relative to men’s earnings. 

Gender Pay is different to unequal pay, which is the unlawful practice of paying men  
and women differently for performing the same or similar work, or work of equal value. 

We are confident that men and women at Bonmarché are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs.

* What is the Mean? The Mean is a comparison of the average pay/bonus  
pay for a woman and the average pay/bonus pay for a man. The Mean can  
be impacted by outlier numbers (very low or very high). 

** What is the Median? The Median is a comparison of the ‘middle’ pay/bonus 
pay for a woman and the ‘middle’ pay/bonus pay for a man if all pay  
amounts were sorted from low to high. The Median figure is described  
by the Government as the ‘best representation of the typical gender pay 
difference in an organisation’.  

UNDERSTANDING THE DATA
There is no Median difference in hourly pay between men and women in Bonmarché. 

The Median figure is described by the Government as the ‘best representation of the typical gender pay difference  
in an organisation’. By way of comparison, the UK Median gender pay gap is 18.4% across all employees  
(source: Office of National Statistics 2017). 

No bonus was paid to men or women in the reporting period and therefore we had no bonus gender pay gap  
between men and women.

OUR MEAN GENDER PAY GAP IS REFLECTIVE OF TWO THINGS:

As a women’s fashion retailer, we find that more women than men are naturally attracted to working for us.  
This is notably the case in our Retail division where the most common role is that of Sales Colleague. 

Where men are employed in our business, they tend to be in roles within our Head Office and Logistics  
divisions in positions where standard pay rates are typically higher.

The quartile analysis shows that men, who represent 12% of our workforce, are under-represented at all levels. This calculation is made 
by dividing our workforce into four equal parts, ranking all the male and female employees from the lowest hourly pay rate to the 
highest hourly pay rate and calculating the percentage of males and females in each. 

ACTIONS
We have used the information in our gender pay gap report to help shape our overall plan for continuing to attract 
and maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce. 

Our actions in this area, which may also help reduce our gender pay gap, include: 

A

As a women’s fashion  
retailer, our workforce is 

predominantly female. We will 

review our recruitment processes to 
see what improvements can be made 

to attract men into our business, 
particularly in our Retail Division. 

The primary consideration 
is always the suitability and  

skill set for the role.

C

B

We will review 

our existing career and 
development plans and 

We already have a number  

of flexible working processes that are 
equally available to male and female 

employees in the organisation and, during 
2017, 87% of flexible working requests were 
accepted. Nonetheless, we will review and 

processes to see where we 

more actively promote our flexible working 

can provide more opportunities 

policies so that our colleagues have more 

for both female and male 

colleagues to develop 

and progress in 

our business. 

opportunity to enjoy a positive 
work-life balance without this 
being a barrier to progression 

or returning to work. 

D

We will further 

analyse our gender pay  
gap report and commit  
to additional actions where 

appropriate and where 

these could make  
positive differences.
