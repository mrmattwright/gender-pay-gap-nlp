                                                                               Home     Jobs and working     Equality    Gender Pay Gap report             Gender Pay Gap report  Gender Pay Gap reporting – as at 31 March 2017  Nottinghamshire County Council wants to be a fair and inclusive employer that is able to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce and to enable all of its employees to fulfil their full potential at work and be rewarded accordingly. This extends to ensuring fair and equal pay between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.  We welcome the opportunity to enhance this commitment by publishing accurate information on the Council’s Gender Pay Gap that has been calculated according to the new reporting requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2016:   Gender Pay Gap infographic [PDF]   The Council’s Gender Pay gap exits largely because we have a much larger percentage of women than men in our direct workforce and in our lowest paid roles.  The Council has already undertaken an extensive job evaluation exercise as part of the implementation of single status in order to address equal pay issues.  To enable us to reduce the gap further, we have analysed the implications of our Gender Pay Gap information in order to identify our priorities for action and developed an action plan to ensure that:   Our recruitment practices consistently encourage and support women to successfully apply for available jobs with the Council across all of our services and at all levels and to be appointed on merit.  Our existing flexible working provisions are actively promoted and extended  to ensure that they are available in jobs at all levels and designed into job roles wherever possible to enable both men and women to progress their careers with the Council  We support and encourage women to develop their skills and qualifications and progress their careers, including into the most senior leadership roles.   We recognise that the Council will need to and are committed to continuing to develop and deliver new and existing measures to incrementally reduce and remove our Gender Pay Gap over time.
