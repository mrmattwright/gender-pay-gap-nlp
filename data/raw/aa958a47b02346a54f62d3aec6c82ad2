The purpose of the Equality Act is to consolidate existing discrimination legislation and contains measures, which are intended to strengthen protection against discrimination.  The protected characteristics in the Public Sector Equality Duty are listed in the Equality Act as: age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation.  Equality Delivery System (EDS)  The EDS was introduced into the NHS in July 2011 and formally launched in November 2011. The EDS is a toolkit and framework for assessing how NHS organisations are performing with regard to Equality, Diversity and Human Rights; how they can improve; and how they get to where they want to be.  The EDS toolkit was refreshed in November 2013 by NHS England and is now known as “EDS2”. It includes a core set of outcomes and a more streamlined grading system; and it encourages organisations to use it flexibly.  The Trust’s EDS is the Action Plan 2017-2018 which was agreed by the Trust Board in July 2017. It is the framework that drives the work of the Trust’s Equality & Diversity agenda to ensure both legislative compliance and best practice. Click here to download the Action Plan 2017-18 .  Download the EDS core outcomes .  The following objectives have been developed to align with Trust Objectives, contractual and legal obligations as well as respond to issues identified through engagement activities:   Bi-monthly IAG meetings  Consulting with external groups/partners and internal partners  Analysis from staff surveys  WRES and Equality data  Suggestion box at the Embrace Equality – Enhance the Experience open day May 18, 2017   Equality Objectives  Strategy: Ensure we have a coherent and pro-active response to Equality, Diversity and Human Rights as it affects our patients, visitors and employees. Ensuring we have a vision of what we want to be, where we want to be and how we are going to get there.  Valuing Our Diverse Workforce: Further develop our diverse workforce that reflects the communities that we serve. We will address gaps and issues impacting on specific Protected Characteristic groups, identified through our data collection and analysis.  Engagement: Recognise and utilise the intelligence and skills available in the wider community by improving engagement and partnership working with our external partners, community and voluntary organisations.  Patient Experience: Develop cultural competence and understanding of diversity supported by access to appropriate resources to enhance patient experience and satisfaction.   Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES)  Since April 2015 all Trusts have been required to submit an annual WRES report and plan to ensure compliance. Each year UHCW Trust Board have been asked to note and approve a WRES reporting template and associated actions. This part of the report is to provide the Trust Board with the assurance that the Trust is compliant with the requirement of NHS England to complete and submit the WRES reporting template by 1st August each year. It also provides the Trust Board with an update on the key elements of progress made on the WRES actions 2015-16.  The national WRES report for 2016 was officially published earlier this year and UHCW was mentioned three times positively.   WRES indicator 3: Relative likelihood of BME staff entering the formal disciplinary process compared to white staff;  WRES indicator 6: Percentage of staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in last 12 months;  WRES indicator 8: In the last 12 months have you personally experienced discrimination at work from any of the following - Manager/Team Leader or other colleagues.   There has been good progress against the actions identified in the 2016 WRES including:   Events specifically targeted at BME staff were organised including EIA focus groups and a conference. However, there has been a poor response to these events, but work continues to try and engage with BME staff;  Informal resolutions such as mediation to reduce the number of formal disciplinaries;  Recruitment of BME staff directly from the Philippines and India;  Increase in the percentage of BME staff;  Work with partners to address violence and aggression against staff;  Refresh of Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) form, guidance and process.   The current data for the 2017 WRES indicates the following key points:   Self-reporting of ethnicity has increased to 96%  There has been a significant and notable increase in the percentage of BME staff (doubled) who have experienced discrimination from Trust employees responding the latest survey  There is a noticeable increase (8%) in the number of BME people experiencing bullying, harassment or abuse from other staff.  Although there is a notable difference between the percentage of voting BME Board members and the percentage of all BME employees, it should also be noted that there has been an increase over the past 12 months in the percentage of BME Board members overall.   The actions identified to address these issues and or gaps are reflected in the Equality and Diversity Action Plan 2017-18.  To view the WRES template and associated actions, please click here .   Link to Trust Objectives and Corporate/Board Assurance Framework Risks The WRES contributes to the Corporate Objectives in that it enables the Trust to identify how it can develop BME staff to their full potential. There is a direct link to improving staff experience, developing a flexible workforce and our recruitment ambitions around use of agency staff if we are able to widen the skills and knowledge of the workforce to respond more appropriately to the needs of our patients.  By addressing the gaps and issues affecting BME staff, it will have a positive impact on the overall workforce’s ability to progress the Trust’s objectives.  Governance The regulators, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) will use the WRES to help assess whether NHS organisations are well-led.  Implementation of the subsequent WRES action plan will be monitored by the Workforce and Engagement Committee and any arising issues escalated to the Quality Governance Committee. There is a requirement for the WRES report and actions to be presented and agreed by Trust Board annually.  Equality Data (Published January 31, 2018)  UHCW NHS Trust is committed to ensuring that the public is able to access relevant information and data in relation to its workforce and patients. This will help to engender a relationship based on transparency and openness, which will in turn enable us to develop a partnership approach with patients and other key stakeholders.  The link provided below will allow you gain a better understanding of the profile of our workforce and patients.  No individual will be identifiable from the information we publish as we pride ourselves in ensuring that our staff and patients are afforded the confidentiality that is their right.  As you will appreciate we are one of the largest Acute Teaching Trusts in the country, therefore, we have a vast amount of information and data relating to our staff and patients. Therefore, it is not possible to publish all our statistics but we have provided key information.  View our latest data  Gender Pay Gap  The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 requires employers to report their gender pay gaps for any year where they have a headcount of 250 or more employees.  The report below details the results from the gender pay review analysis (March 2017) for University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust undertaken as part of the Equality Act 2010 specific duties.  It is important to note the difference between gender pay gap and equal pay as being:   Equal pay relates to men and women earning equal pay for the same, or similar work.  Gender pay gap refers to the difference between men and women’s average pay within an organisation.   Download the UHCW Gender Pay Gap Report - March 2018  Equality Impact Assessments (EIA)  If you wish to view the most recent EIAs or would like further information, please contact info@uhcw.nhs.uk  UHCW NHS Trust has legal duties under the Equality Act 2010 to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations on the basis of Protected Characteristics (age, disability, race/ethnicity/nationality, religion/belief, marriage/civil partnership, sexual orientation, gender, gender reassignment/transgender and pregnancy/maternity).  The Equality and Diversity team has recently revised and updated the Trust’s EIA form so that it encourages meaningful consideration of the needs of the diverse communities and workforce we serve and work with.  EIAs will help to identify if there is potential to negatively impact on any of the Protected Characteristics groups and allow adaptations as necessary. It will also alert to whether any groups may have particular needs.  The EIA process will help to avoid claims of unlawful discrimination as it provides a framework to ensure the Trust meets its legislative duties. The process helps the Trust to anticipate problems and make informed and open decisions.  Independent Advisory Group (IAG)  The Independent Advisory Group (IAG) for Equality and Diversity was established in March 2013 and the remit of the group is:   To influence and oversee the development and operation of Equality, Diversity and Human Rights matters (or issues) for the Trust and anyone involved (or participating) in the care and services we deliver.  To act as a source of expertise and reference point for the organisation on Equality, Diversity and Human Rights related matters.   The group meets bi-monthly and by ensuring meaningful consultation, involvement and participation of the wider community, we have enabled them to influence and shape our plans; and assess our progress against the actions identified. Policies, key changes and consultations are reviewed and assessed by the IAG so that the Trust is able to demonstrate that issues regarding equality of access and equality of outcome are considered and integrated in to the Trust’s core business.   The membership of the group includes representation from:      • Carers Trust Heart of England • Community individual (gay/lesbian community) • Community individual (older people) • Faith Centre • Coventry City Council • Grapevine (people with physical/sensory/learning disabilities) • Head of Patient Relations    • Health & Wellbeing/Smoking Cessation Lead • Healthwatch Coventry • Modern Matrons • Representative from Rugby St Cross • Staffside • Volunteer Services • Ward Managers       Representative members of the IAG are encouraged to report back to their organisations, departments and/or colleagues on how the Trust is progressing regarding Equality, Diversity and Human Rights and in turn ensure that the Trust is made aware of issues, as viewed by the wider community, partners and stakeholders, which are likely to impact on patient choice, care and satisfaction.  The meetings are used to not only oversee the Action Plan but to also address current and live issues as they arise. Guest speakers are invited who are able to inform and engender discussion to help the group identify further actions to support local and national concerns.
