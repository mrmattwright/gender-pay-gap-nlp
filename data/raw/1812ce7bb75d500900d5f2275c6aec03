We know Dell Inc. is only as strong as the sum of its parts, and a more diverse team is a stronger team. It delivers more innovative ideas for our customers, which ultimately makes us all more successful. We all have a role to play in creating an environment where every team member, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, seniority or ability, feels valued and motivated to deliver their best work.  It is because we have this focus and understanding, that we take our gender pay gap results as a call to action. While we are proud of the commitment our leaders have made to accelerate the movement of women into more senior roles, our gender pay gap results show that we have more work ahead of us, and a responsibility to deliver on that commitment.  At the end of the day, results are what matter. Ours are not where we want them to be, so addressing the gender pay gap will remain a priority for us until it no longer exists.  Here is our 2017 gender pay gap report, which details our results and what we are doing to narrow the gap.
