 

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender 
Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. Gender pay gap reporting legislation requires that from 2017, any 
organization that has 250 or more employees must publish and report specific figures about their gender 
pay gap. The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, 
expressed relative to men’s earnings.

Written statement 
 
We employ thousands of UK contractors across many different sectors.  Our employees source the majority 
of their assignments through recruitment agencies and often negotiate contract rates directly with the 
recruitment agency.  Rates of pay can vary significantly dependent on the sectors and roles they engage in 
and, as a result, the published results above are affected by the mix of employees across these various 
sectors and roles.  By way of example, within PayStream My Max 2, there is a concentration of male 
contractors in the logistics sector which, as they are at a lower average rate than other sectors, results in the 
average women’s pay across all employees being above that of men. We confirm that the calculations in 
our report are accurate and have been calculated in accordance with Gender Pay Gap Reporting 
requirements as outlined in the legislation and accompanying guidance.
