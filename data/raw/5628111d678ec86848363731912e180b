To support this, our approach to pay is gender neutral by design.  As a business that firmly believes in fairness, equality and inclusion, we are committed to reducing our gender pay gap.  New efforts to improve corporate transparency include a requirement for UK companies with over 250 employees to report publically on their gender pay gap.  Data shows that in this respect Vision for Education, which employs over 2,900 teachers and internal staff, performs as well – and sometimes better - than many similar sized companies in our industry. Nevertheless, we can and must do better.  For more information, please see our full 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report.
