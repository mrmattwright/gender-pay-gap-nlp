School Ethos and Values   Montsaye Community Learning Partnership considers education as a lifelong process. By working collaboratively across the entirety of a child’s education we aim to enhance pupils’ life chances by providing a cohesive educational experience that will help that child to become an independent, thoughtful and resilient learner who makes excellent progress regardless of their starting point.  Children will be encouraged to adopt positive learning behaviours as they develop into young adults and we will expect high standards of achievement and behaviour in a positive, caring environment which fosters mutual respect between students, staff and parents.  By creating a strong learning community across the schools in the MCLP we will create a positive learning environment where all pupils believe that they can achieve, wish to make progress and believe that their achievements are valued.
