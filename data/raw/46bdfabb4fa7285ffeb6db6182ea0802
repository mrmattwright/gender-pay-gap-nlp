This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employees data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. We will do this prior to the deadline of April 4 th 2018.  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace  the balance of male and female employees at different levels  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.   The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.  Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing HR and payroll records. All employees can confirm and update their records if they choose to by using the CFO website or contacting Head Office on 01934 514350.           Central Facilities Group is an equal opportunities employer and offer a pay structure based on individual site requirements, irrespective of gender. Internally we presently employ more women (84%) than men (16%). This difference is at odds with the industry as confirmed by official statistics for 2016 and 2017 where 95% (1) and 97% (2) of total Housekeeper (and related occupations) positions in the UK were filled by females.  We are pleased to see that our figures exceed these national averages and demonstrate our continued commitment to be an equal opportunities employer.  Our results show that overall our gender pay gap is negligible in size at 1.3% and 0% respectively. As above, the majority of housekeeping industry workers are female, something which we are inherently affected by and have little effect of changing.  In respect of the control we have over our own colleagues, all new colleagues are recruited under the same conditions and their earning ability depends on their success and career progress as individuals.  All internal employees are encouraged to grow and earn to their full potential. Any pay gap difference shown will be a result of differing roles, however all employees performing the same job and duties will be earning the same rewards.  We strive to continually improve our gender gap and will publish the results again in April 2019 as required by the government initiative on equal pay.  I confirm that these calculations and supporting narrative are accurate at time of publication.                                   References;  1 UK. Office for National Statistics. (2016).
