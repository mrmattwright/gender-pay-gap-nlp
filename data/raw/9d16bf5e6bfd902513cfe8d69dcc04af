Annual Equalities Statement:  Meeting our Public Sector Equality Duty in 2016-17 

1.  Eliminating discrimination and other conduct that is prohibited by the Equalities Act 2010 

 

 

 

Promoting equality has always been at the heart of the Trust’s mission.  Our focus since the earliest days 
has been on delivering educational excellence to young people - particularly those who are suffering 
from disadvantage in all its guises – to maximise their potential, regardless of their starting point.  A 
commitment to equality of opportunity is at the core of everything we do.   
This starts right at the top.  In our governance and accountability framework, the duty to ensure the 
Trust and its schools comply with equalities legislation and fulfil both the general and specific duties is 
reserved to the Board of Trustees.  The Board’s specific terms of reference include responsibility for 
safeguarding, SEN/D and inclusion.  The Academic Board has responsibility for more detailed oversight of 
the Trust’s approach to vulnerable pupils.   
Trustees have approved the Trust’s main Equalities Policy and the complementary Equal Opportunities 
Policy for staff.  Local Governing Bodies (LGBs) consider the policies and oversee implementation in their 
respective schools.  Governors receive equalities training.   
Standard templates for reports to the Board and its Committees (including the LGBs) have been 
introduced.  These templates include a specific requirement to consider whether an Equalities Impact 
Assessment (EIA) is required and a requirement to complete the Trust’s standard template when one is 
needed.   
Students are treated as an individual throughout their school career with Tauheedul.  At the point of 
induction, parents are free to discuss any specific requirements their child may have with regard to any 
of the relevant protected characteristics.  Bespoke attainment targets are set for every student that 
recognise their starting point and help stretch them to maximise their potential.  Every student’s 
performance is reviewed regularly as part of the Trust’s rigorous approach to monitoring and school SLTs 
keep an overview of performance to ensure that every child’s progress is maintained.  The Head of Data 
at the Trust is able to monitor the attainment and progress of all students sharing protected 
characteristics, which is compared with the progress of those students who do not have any protected 
characteristics.           
Similarly, the Trust builds equalities considerations into its staffing policies and practices from the outset.  
All recruitment advertisements refer to our commitment to equal opportunities.  “Masked” shortlisting 
has been introduced meaning that candidates are identified by reference number only until shortlisting 
has been concluded.  Equal opportunities monitoring information that is voluntarily provided at 
application stage is anonymised and used by the Trust to measure diversity within the applicant pool and 
workforce to ensure that we are meeting our obligations under the Equalities Act.  The Trust has started 
work to introduce a new application tracking and HR management information system during 
2018/19.  The Trust has purchased a virtual learning environment and during 2018-19 an e-learning 
module specifically focused on equality and diversity will be developed and hosted on the site.    
The Trust’s HR policies and procedures are designed to ensure equality of treatment for all staff, 
including ensuring equality of access to continuing development and other training opportunities.  We 
offer flexible and “family friendly” working opportunities.   

2.  Advancing equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and 

people who do not have it  
The Trust and its schools have a range of policies and procedures in place to advance equality of 
opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not.  As outlined 
above, these include our governance and accountability framework, our equalities and related policies, 
target setting and attainment tracking for students and training for staff and governors. 
Whilst effective policies, procedures and monitoring arrangements are essential, what matters more is 
what happens within our schools.  Specific examples of good practice are set out below: 

Student Support 

Lunchtime adjustments for students with severe allergies, disabilities, those that are vulnerable and those who 
require extra time. 
Ensure that we ask for all child, parent, and carer access needs when joining school and how they would like to 
receive information.

to receive information. 
Support to students who are pregnant or become young mothers.

sexual orientation etc.  Strategies for supporting victims – restorative justice approaches.

Special consideration is always given to families who have a particular need that could be considered to give 
them a disadvantage from others, financially, or with extra time or resources. 
Transition meetings with Primary Schools. 
Specialised equipment and support for children who have physical, hearing or visual impairments. 
Ensure leadership positions in the school are accessible to students of all backgrounds.

negative impact or disadvantages for staff who have a protected characteristic. 
Special consideration is always given to staff who have a particular need that could be considered to give them 
a disadvantage from others, financially, or with extra time or resources. 
Trust Maternity Policy followed.  Risk Assessment undertaken for pregnant members of staff and meetings held 
to discuss concerns or any assistance needed. 
Ensure all staff are asked for access needs when joining the school and how they would like to receive 
information.

6.  Staff:  Gender Pay Gap 

In line with statutory requirements the Trust has reported the following on the Government’s designated 
reporting website: www.gov.uk/genderpaygap.  The figures have been compiled inline with Government Guidance 
and are based on a 31st March 2017 snapshot date. 
 
Women’s Hourly Rate is 18.8% lower (Mean) and 10.4% lower (Median) than Men’s.

The Trust does not pay bonuses. 
 
We wish to highlight that a gender pay gap should not be confused with ‘equal pay’ – as a gender pay gap does 
not necessarily mean that there is inequality in the way our staff are rewarded for the work that they do.  We 
understand that the gender pay gap affects employers worldwide and reflects many factors including those that 
are external to the workplace including career stereotyping and the cultural use of part-time working.   
 
The Trust is committed to reward our staff fairly for the work they do, regardless of their gender or other 
protected characteristic.   The Trust will incorporate the consideration of our current gender gap as we develop 
our policies; particularly with regard to recruitment, retention and workforce development policies.  Through 
these we will seek to actively reduce the gap in areas that we believe we can have influence as a responsible 
employer.
