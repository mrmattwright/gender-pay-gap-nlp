1. 
 
1.1.  To discuss and present the Gender Pay Gap Information 

Purpose of the Report 

 
 
Background 
 

2. 

2.1.  The  Equality  Act  (Specific  Duties  and  Public  Authorities)  Regulations  2017 
requires us to publish our Gender Pay Gap Information. The snapshot date for 
the information contained in this report is at 31st March 2017, and this must be 
published on our website by 30th March 2018, and annually thereafter. 
 

2.2.  The legislation comes from the Government’s commitment to remove barriers 
to  equality.  It  is  intended  as  a  tool  for  assessing  levels  of  equality  in  the 
workplace and male and female participation. It is a legal requirement for us to 
publish the gender pay data.  
 

2.3.  The gender pay gap data we are required to publish is the: 

  mean gender pay gap 
  median gender pay gap 
  The mean bonus gender pay gap 
  The median bonus gender pay gap 
  The proportion of males receiving a bonus payment 
  The proportion of females receiving a bonus payment

2.4. 

  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band. 

In  producing  the  data  there  is  an  extended  definition  of  who  counts  as  an 
employee. It includes employees (with a contract of employment); contractors 
and some self-employed people. The information has been produced from the 
Council’s  payroll  system  along  with  some  information  from  the  Creditors 
system. 
 

2.5.  The  gender  pay  gap  shows  the  difference  between  the  average  (mean  and 
median)  earnings  of men and  women. This  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  of 
men’s earnings. 
 

2.6.  Much  of  the  national  commentary  has  focussed  on  barriers  to  women  in  the 
workplace, and the ‘glass ceiling’ including part time work that has traditionally 
been lower paid, with typically a higher proportion women work part time than 
men.  
 

2.7.  Other factors affecting the gender pay gap include stereotypical pay for some 
occupations/professions for example in construction and financial services, as 
demonstrated by the following graph:

Report  
 

4.1.  Our results are as follows: 
4.1.1  Table 1 
 

 
Male 
Female 
Gender Pay Gap 

Mean hourly rate 
£11.96 
£11.72 
2.01% 

Median hourly rate 
£10.32 
£11.03 
-6.88% 

 
4.1.2   Bonus: Nil. No one at ESBC receives any bonus pay. 
 
4.1.3   Table 2 

 

 
Upper Quartile 
Upper Middle Quartile 
Lower Middle Quartile 
Lower Quartile 

Male 
43.80 % 
34.43% 
58.68% 
40.16% 

Female  
56.20% 
65.57% 
41.32% 
59.84% 

 

 

4.2.  The positive figure of mean (2.01%) reveals that overall female employees have 

lower pay than male employees.  
 

4.3.  However the negative figure of (-6.88%), the median average, at the middle of 
the organisation shows that male employees have a lower pay rate than female 
employees at the middle of the organisation. 
 

4.4.  The size of our pay gap indicates that there are no significant issues to deal 

with. This compares favourably with early reports from the public sector. 
 

4.5.  Participation in ESBC overall workforce is 55.65% Female and 44.35% Male. 
Within  each  quartile  the  workforce  is  diverse  and  representative  of  both 
genders;  with  part  time  and  casual  workers  presenting  themselves  in  each 
quartile.  
 

4.6   ESBC carried out Job Evaluation and implemented Single Status for pay grades 

in 2008, and the integrity of the pay model has been maintained since then. 

 
4.7   Our employment policies around flexible working are progressive, these were 
enhanced as part of the 2008 pay review. Our homeworking and family leave 
policies have continued to be reviewed and improved. 2017/2018 actions have 
included  the  following  relevant  policy  reviews:  Equal  Opportunities  in 
Employment;  Dignity  at Work;  Recruitment  and  Selection  Guidance;  Flexible 
Working  Hours  Scheme;  Family  Friendly  Provisions;  Homeworking;  and 
Maternity Scheme updated. 

 
4.8  Benefits have included retention of female employees returning from maternity 
leave.  In  2016/17  80%  returned  to  work  from  maternity  leave,  and  40% 
submitted flexible working requests which were accepted. In 2017/18 to date 
100%  have  returned,  or  have  agreed  return  dates,  from  maternity  leave  and

66.67% of these  returners  have  submitted flexible  working  requests  and had 
them agreed. This includes those in line management positions.  

 
4.9.1  The following actions are suggested for 2018/19: 

 

4.9.1  Analysis of recruitment proportions to men and women by occupation to reveal 
if there are any are any underlying trends so that we can identify any steps to 
narrow the gender pay gaps, and maybe attract a wider pool of potential recruits 
for some occupational areas that may favour one gender.  
 

4.9.2  Career  and  talent  development:  Review  proportions  of  men  and  women 

requesting and taking up post entry training and apprenticeships. 
 

4.9.3  Increased homeworking opportunities made available with the accommodation 

move
