Background to Independence Matters  Independence Matters employs approximately 800 staff members across a diverse range of support services throughout the county of Norfolk..  We are a not for profit, community interest company who run our businesses for the benefit of people and communities.  We are committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above).  Independence Matters evaluates job roles and pay grades and have pay associated with the role rather than the person employed in that role to ensure a fair structure and is proud that the gender pay gap reflects this.  Some facts about the Independence Matters  74% of all employees are female  85% of all managers are female  84% of the senior management team are female  We have a female Managing Director  Our approach to pay and benefits  Employees under 25 years olds are paid our full adult pay rate rather than using the lower tier permitted under the national living wage  Our highest paid colleague is paid 4.74 times that of our lowest paid employee, very much within the maximum ratio of 20 recommended by the Work Foundation  Actions  Our current mean pay difference of -2.2% shows Independence Matters gender pay gap results reflect the proportion of female to male employees in the company. However it does not mean that the company should take no action, rather it needs to work with others in the sector to encourage more interest from male job seekers to be able to match our customer profile. Though Independence Matters recognises that its scope to act is limited in some areas - it has, for example, no direct control over the subjects that individuals choose to study or the career choices that they make.  We are committed to continuing to support career events at local secondary schools and career fairs to raise young people's awareness of the different career opportunities available within the health and social care sector, and to help dispel any misperceptions and stereotypes.    What people say…    Staff at the centre are very approachable and offer us positive support in a true partnership.    If mum was not able to attend the centre we feel she would be more confused and disorientated as it is a positive part of daily life.    I like where I live, the people I live with and the staff.    I love going to Church Green Lodge I get to see my friends and the staff are like my family.    I matter .. Because life is worth living.    The service that independence matters providers not only supports the person with meaningful activities but also the family carers receive emotional support from the staff. A very valuable experience.         © Independence Matters CIC   T: 0300 790 0508  E:  contactus@independencematters.org.uk   Registered in England Number 8530621     Home  About Us  Why Choose Us  Our Services  Careers and Volunteers  News and Events  Contact Us     Services   Community Hubs  Personal Assistant Service  Respite Care  Supported Living  Stepping Out  Norfolk Industries  How to Access Our Services  Locations  Older People Services  Additional Services     Social matters   Facebook  Twitter  Sign up to our newsletter     Graphic Design: Naked Marketing  In partnership with
