INTRODUCTION 
This report contains Mleczko Delikatesy Ltd statutory disclosure of the gender pay gap for 2017.  
 

Legislation 
introduced  as 
Gender  pay  gap 
amendment  to  the  Equality  Act  2010  to  encourage 
employers to make greater progress in addressing the 
imbalance of earnings between women and men.  

legislation  was 

From  6  April  2017  any  UK 

organization employing 250 or more 

employees  has  to  publicly  report  on 

its gender pay gap.  

 
What is gender pay gap?  
The gender pay gap measures the difference between average earnings of all men and women in 
an organization.  
It is reported in six different ways: the mean (average) and median (mid-point on a distribution) 
gender pay gaps; the mean and median bonus gender pay gaps; the proportion of men and women 
who received bonuses in a year to 5 April and proportion of men and women according to quartile 
pay bands.  
It doesn’t not take into consideration the role that the employee performs or the seniority of the 
employee. The gender pay gap can occur despite men and women being paid equally for the same 
or similar role.  
 

Mean vs. median 
The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean (average) hourly rate of pay of male 
full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.  
The  median  gender  pay  gap  is  the  difference  between  the  median  (mid-point  on  a  distribution) 
hourly  rate  of  pay  of  male  full-pay  relevant  employees  and  that  of  female  full-pay  relevant 
employees.  
 

Equal pay 
The gender pay gap differs from equal pay.  
Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, 
similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man 
or a woman, unless there is a “genuine material factor” for the difference. 
Mleczko Delikatesy is an equal pay employer.

GENDER PAY GAP RESULTS 
The  overall  ordinary  gender  pay  gap  as  at  
5 April 2017 at Mleczko Delikatesy is 0.5% on  
a median basis and 5.1% using mean pay.  
This compares to the UK mean gap which, as 
reported by the Office of National Statistics in 
April 2016, is 18.1%  
 
 

What is included in our calculations?  
 

Ordinary pay is not limited to basic pay, but also includes pay for leave, pay for shift premium and 
pay for night shift. It doesn’t include pay for overtime, pay relating to sick pay or maternity pay.  
Bonus pay in our case relates to an annual bonus. Calculations of mean and median bonus pay use 
bonus pay from December 2016 (bonus paid during year to 5 April 2017, employees who joined 
the company after December 2016 received annual bonus in December 2017)

The chart below sets out gender proportions in ordinary pay quartiles. We have broken down our 
reportable  workforce  in  order  of  fixed  pay,  from  lowest  to  highest,  divided  this  into  four  equal 
groups to show how the proportions of women and men vary in each quartile.

WHY DOES MLECZKO DELIKATESY HAVE A GENDER PAY GAP?  
 

In  common  with  retail  sector,  our  company  is 
predominantly  female.  There  are  more  women  in 
entry  level  or  lower  paid  roles,  but  fewer  in  higher 
paid, requiring specialist qualifications or senior ones. 
Also, the turnover in senior roles is much lower than 
in entry levels, which means vacancies for such roles 
do not arise as frequently.  
 
Even  small  fluctuations  in  the  male  workforce  can 
have a significant impact on our gender pay gap. For 
instance,  if  we  were  to  have  female  butchers  and 
lorry drivers, the overall mean gender pay gap would 
drop to 0%.  
 
Similarly,  based  on  how  the  gender  pay  gap  is 
calculated,  if  we  were  to  employ  more  men  in  the 
lower pay quartiles, while keeping the overall number 
of staff the same, this would act to reduce the gender 
pay gap.  
 
However, women in our organization, due to family 
or  carer  responsibilities,  often  choose  part  time 
positions on a regular pay where flexible working is 
prevalent, as opposed to men choosing full time roles 
and opting for night shifts at a premium pay.  
 
Although our employees value flexibility of part time 
working,  part  time  workers’  bonuses  negatively 
impact  the  bonus  gender  pay  gap,  as  their  bonuses 
are not adjusted in the calculations to reflect the fact 
they are not full time, as well as annual bonus being 
paid  pro-rata  for  those  who  joined  the  company 
throughout the calendar year. 
 
All  these  factors  significantly  influence  our  gender 
pay  gap  results  and  are  areas  for  taking  the  action 
within the next years.

TAKING ACTION  
 

We are prioritizing the following areas for action:  

We will explore how we can attract more men into our organization to 

entry level roles and more women  to senior roles. We will start with 

evaluating recruitment processes and changing the language in job ads.  

We will encourage shared parental leave - not only it gives men equal 

access  to  parental  leave,  but  also  positively  contributes  to  reducing 

gender pay gap.  

We  will  implement  pay  transparency  into  annual  pay  review  and 

establish  meritocratic  career  advancement  paths  to  ensure  no  bias 

towards each gender.  

We  will  improve  workforce  planning  and  allowing  flexible  working 

more often, improve flexible work policies that would include shared 

jobs and part time management roles.  

 

We will develop a scheme of encouraging and mentoring women for 

promotion and into higher paid roles.
