RM Education Limited

Gender Pay Reporting

RM Education Ltd is made up of two Divisions within 
the RM Group (RM Education and RM Results) and 
Corporate Services.  Corporate Services includes group roles 
such as CEO, CFO and the Heads of certain Group functions.

RM Education is a UK focused business supplying IT software 
and services to schools and colleges.  The RM Results Division 
provides IT software and services to exam boards and 
professional awarding bodies to help them digitise exams in 
the UK and internationally through the use of e-assessment. 
In addition, the Division manages and analyses educational 
data on behalf of the UK central government. 

The workforce is a mix of customer support roles and 
technical roles supported by the key functions of sales, 
marketing, Finance, HR and IT.

The Gender Pay reporting regulations require all UK legal 
entities with over 250 employees to publish the following 
sets of data annually:

•  Mean and median gender pay gap (hourly earnings)

•  Mean and median gender bonus gap 

(for those receiving a bonus)

•  Proportion of men and women that received a bonus

•  Proportion of men and women working in different 

pay quartiles 

This data is designed to look at the difference in the average 
pay of men and women regardless of their role or level 
within the Company.  This is different to Equal Pay which 
focuses on equal pay for equal work.

How we are closing the pay gap

CEO Statement

We are committed to investing in ongoing initiatives to help 
ensure a balanced participation in the workforce and support 
a reduction in the gender pay gap: 

•  continued encouragement of flexible working; we already 
offer enhanced family leave and support employees with 
their return to work following adoption, maternity and 
parental leave

•  we are in the process of implementing an unconscious 

bias training module for our managers and will 
continue to look at ways to support managers to 
create high-performing inclusive teams

•  we will mentor women identified as talent within the 
organisation to help create a stronger female talent 
pipeline for senior roles

•  we are exploring ways to create a strong early careers 
programme and will work with schools to encourage 
females into technical apprenticeship roles 

The Group is committed to offering equal employment 
opportunities and its policies are designed to attract, 
retain and motivate the best staff regardless of gender, 
sexual orientation, race, religion, age, disability or 
educational background.

I can confirm the accuracy of the data presented in this 
report as at 5 April 2017 and that it has been calculated 
in accordance with the legislation and guidelines for 
gender pay reporting.
