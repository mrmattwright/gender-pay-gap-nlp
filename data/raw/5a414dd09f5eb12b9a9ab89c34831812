OUR 2017  
GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

learndirect Ltd is an organisation that firmly believes in fairness, equality and 
inclusion. An employer who aims to attract and retain a passionate and diverse 
workforce, whilst paying men and women equally for equivalent roles. Analysis  
does show however that a slight gender pay gap exists. This is highlighted and 
discussed below. 

What does gender pay gap reporting include?

From 2017 onwards, any UK employer with over 250 employees must report their gender pay gap.  
The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between men and women within  
the organisation. 

The regulations include the following requirements:
• The average difference between salary and bonus for males and females (mean and median) over a 
12-month period. This report covers the 12 months up to 5 April 2017.
• The proportion of males and females receiving bonus pay.
• The proportion of males to females by quartile bands of pay level.

Gender  
bonus gap

The table highlights that the mean bonus pay gap 
for this year is quite high. This is due to a specific 
bonus obligation payable to senior stakeholders on 
a particularly successful contract. The stakeholders 
working on this contract were male which has 
impacted the bonus gap. Next year the gap will  
be lower. 

Proportion of employees receiving bonus pay

Male

28%

Female

65.6%

This shows a 37.6% difference in the number of 
men and women who received a bonus for their 
performance in 2016. Reviewing the data shows 
that this is largely due to the facts that learndirect 
a) employs more women 
b) these women were in operational roles eligible for 
bonus payments. 

As a company we understand the importance of reducing the gender pay gap. We will continue to monitor 
the data to address any gaps and ensure our policies and procedures are fair. This includes recruitment 
practices and our approach to pay and annual performance appraisals.

The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. I confirm the data reported is accurate.
