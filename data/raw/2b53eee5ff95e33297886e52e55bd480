We embrace this richness and diversity and aim to have a workforce and talent pool that reflects the community and society.  In line with legislation, we offer equal pay for the same roles, skills and levels of experience regardless of whether they are performed by men or women.  We will actively aim to develop our female colleagues and keep attracting women for the more senior positions and leadership roles.  We believe that our organisation will benefit from inclusiveness and diversity and that this will be a contributing factor to our ongoing and future success.”  – Anthony Francheterre, CEO  Reporting and KPIs  The new UK regulations require us to calculate the gender pay gap according to a specific calculation methodology . The results are based on the April 2017 payroll.  The calculated gender pay gap does not reflect equal pay .  Equal pay is when men and women are paid the same for a similar job/skills/experience – the gender pay gap shows the difference between the average pay of women and men in the organisation, regardless of roles, positions, experience or skills. Equal pay is a legal requirement.  In addition to the gender pay gap which is expressed with two measures, the ‘ mean’ and the ‘ average’ , the bonus pay gap is also calculated.  The report also provides insight into the proportion of women and men in the different pay bands: the population is split up into 4 quartiles according to the average hourly pay.  Our Results     Median and Mean Pay Gap  Median pay gap: The median pay gap reflects the difference in pay between the middle point man and the middle point woman: the middle point woman has 50% of female colleagues with a higher hourly pay and 50% of colleagues with a lower hourly pay. And the same is valid for the middle point man. It is seen to be a better measure than the ‘mean’ because it corrects for men or women in senior roles who have a relatively high hourly pay.   Our median pay gap of 7.6% says that the middle point women earns 7.6% less than the middle point man. This is a result of the higher representation of men in senior roles.  Mean pay gap :  The mean gap sums up the hourly rate of all the women in the organisation and divides it by the number of women. The same is done for the male operation. The difference between the two averages is the mean gap.   Our mean pay gap of 17.1% says that the average hourly pay for women is 17.1% below the average hourly pay for men. This is the result of the higher representation of men in senior roles.  Findings and Mission   Tangerine is supportive of the government Gender Pay Gap Initiative. We believe that it will provide a stimulus for organisations to reflect on their gender and diversity policies.  Because we are clear that we offer equal pay, our gender pay gap is the result of an under-presentation of women in the more senior roles (senior management roles or higher skilled~roles at the manufacturing sites – e.g. engineering).  We have a clear ambition to increase the number of women in senior roles.  Whilst we believe that we are already doing good things, we are conscious that we can do more and better.  We are developing and improving a programme which will focus on diversity.  The best way to convince women of potential in the organisation is to demonstrate and inspire by example: – Women in senior positions sharing their experience and success – Mentorship by women in senior roles  We will introduce surveys to measure progress and to help us to (re)orientate our programme.   – Marieke Van Troys, CFO and HR responsible  Action Plan Testimonies  Sonia Ireland – Strategic Development Manager  An Associate Chartered Management Accountant.  “I have worked for Tangerine Confectionery on 2 separate occasions.  Initially from 2006 to 2009 as Group Financial Controller for Operations, responsible for the finances of the factories, distribution and procurement.  In this role I was open to interaction at all levels from shop floor to exec level.  I was given the freedom and flexibility within this role to apply my ideas and provide my input to help the business achieve its objectives.  I was approached by Tangerine Confectionery in 2013 to join in a more senior role as Head of Commercial and Operations Finance.  Having gained commercial finance experience within another organisation for 4 years.  Tangerine had a gap within its finance team and a new role was developed for me to pull on both my operational and commercial experience.  I worked within this role for 4 years, and was given support and provided challenges to aid my development during that time, whilst I also expressed my desire for a more strategic role.  I was offered a Strategic Development Managers role in August 2017, allowing me to develop new skills and working with both internal and external expertise to support the delivery of the company Blue Chips and key business projects.  Tangerine has provided me with opportunities to support my development and career progression. I feel valued, trusted and confident to share my skills and ideas.”  Dee Quick – UK Sales Director  “My personal experience and as a Senior Leader at Tangerine is that the ethos of recruitment and promotion is based on meritocracy. Since joining Tangerine in 2012 my ambition to join the board of Directors has been very well supported with training and coaching helping me secure my Sales Director role in 2016 against direct male competition. Tangerine has some strong female Senior Leaders who provide good role models and also who help grow an environment that gives women confidence.”             More News                     Our brands  Who we are  Careers  News  TV Ad  Barratt  Contact      Copyright Tangerine Confectionery 2015.
