A preferred supplier list is operated in the UK.  Right to Work in the UK  The UK Government has taken steps to reduce net migration to the UK by limiting the number of overseas workers from outside the EEA coming to the UK for employment. Consequently, whilst we are able to consider applications from overseas workers from outside the EEA (who require a Tier 2 General Visa) we can only employ them if we can provide evidence that there are no other suitable candidates available from inside the EEA. Therefore all Non-UK/EEA nationals’ applications will be kept on hold until we have pursued all candidates who currently have the right to work in the UK.            ╳         Search    About Us History & Approach  Board of Directors  Executive Leadership  News Media FAQs  Image Library  Media Contacts   2016  2015  2014  2013  2012  2011  2010  2009  2008  2007  2006  2005  2004  2003  2002  2001  2000  1999  1998   Contact Us  Company Values & Code of Conduct   Products & Pipeline Research & Trials Therapeutic Areas  Cannabinoid Compounds  Mechanism of Action  R&D Collaborations  Research Papers   Pipeline  Epidiolex  Sativex Patient Information Summary of Product Characteristics   Prescriber Information    Epilepsy Patients & Caregivers For Patients  For Clinicians & Researchers Research   Heroes of Epilepsy Chase's Story    Investors  Careers UK Careers  US Careers              Home  News  Contact Us  Legal    ©2016 GW Pharmaceuticals, plc.
