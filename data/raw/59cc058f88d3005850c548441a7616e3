Howard Tenens has given us exceptional service over the past 11 years. The day to day running of the contract services are generally seamless but where they did add value is in their flexibility and willingness to help during times of change. A great company to work with. Ben Reardon - Head of Logistics  It’s so important to us that everyone understands our journey and sees the bigger picture that we are working towards. To achieve t his, we have worked together on several dedicated initiatives, one of which being a secondment programme. A member of the Howard Tenens team came and joined us for 6 months to help with a maternity cover contract and this is probably when the real partnership started to develop. This insider experience really helped Howard Tenens better understand our needs and requests. Iain Harris - Asahi UK Ltd Head of Supply Chain Operations  The shape and size of their business is much less intimidating than some of the larger players, this also positions them well to be a value-match partner of choice. Eleanor Chester – Costa Express Supply Chain Manager  We operate a Total Quality Management approach that is based on systematic methods, aimed at improving our efficiency and effectiveness. It is important for our suppliers to work in line with these too. Howard Tenens’ privately owned status helps this happen. I know that they can react with us as situations change, pressures grow and market demands evolve. They can blend their practices in with ours. Importantly, I believe that our cultures also complement each other’s; which helps us all get to where we want to be. Steve Jackson – Honda Motor Europe Logistics General Manager  Good suppliers are the ones that feel like an extension of our own team – they understand us, understand the pressures we face and also appreciate the unique nature of our business. The team at Tenens demonstrate this understanding time after time. And the investment that they have made to get to know us pays dividends in terms of our time. Their willingness and ability to ‘get the job done’, based on informed decisions and expertise makes a huge difference. Kareen Boutonnat - Lightsource Renewable Energy Managing Director  We have a great positive face to face relationship with Howard Tenens, they are able to service warehousing and distribution to the growing customer and offer flexibility. Simon Jennings, Muc Off Logistics Manager  One of the reasons Howard Tenens are as impressive as they are is that they don’t fill the business full of temporary drivers. Instead, we know we’re working with committed, longer term individuals – it’s why we trust them to the extent we do.
