DEFINITIONS

•   The mean gender pay gap is the difference in average 

hourly rates of pay that male and female employees 
receive. The median gender pay gap is the difference 
in the midpoints of pay rates (ordered from highest to 
lowest) for men and women. The mean and median 
gender pay gap is based on hourly rates of pay as at 5 
April 2017.

•   The mean gender bonus gap is the difference in 

average bonus pay that male and female employees 
receive. The median gender bonus gap is the 
difference in the midpoints of bonus pay (ordered from 
highest to lowest) for men and women. The mean 
and median gender bonus gap considers bonus pay 
received in the 12 months leading up to 5 April 2017.
•   The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal 
pay relates to men and women being paid equally for 
equal work regardless of gender.
