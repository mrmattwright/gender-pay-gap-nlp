We are pleased to present our findings as per the below, as at the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.    Gender Pay Reporting involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it does not involve publishing individual employees data. We can use these results to assess the levels of gender equality in our workplace, the balance of male and female employees at different levels and how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded. The challenge in our organisation, and indeed in companies across Great Britain, is to eliminate any gender pay gap.    Report  Difference in hourly rate of pay and bonus pay:        Hourly Pay  Bonus Pay    Mean  -0.3%  23.3%    Median  -1.4%  -50.0%     The above table shows our mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly pay rates and bonus payments at the snapshot date of 5th April 2017. The calculation is shown as amount of men paid more than women; negative figures indicate women paid more than men.   Percentage of employees who received bonus pay:        Bonus Paid  No Bonus Paid    Men  11.4%  88.6%    Women  41.0%  59.0%     Employees by pay quartile:         Lower  Lower Middle  Upper Middle  Upper    Men  89.2%  95.1%  86.3%  91.2%    Women  10.8%  4.9%  13.7%  8.8%     The above shows the gender distribution across four equally sized quartiles, each containing 102 employees.   Comment   Alton Nutile, head of commercial, says, “It is encouraging to note such a small gender pay gap especially in an industry such as the security industry where hourly pay is a big driver. We have implemented a number of actions intended to help reduce that gender pay gap, for example a thorough recruitment and selection process and providing development opportunities to all staff. We offer some flexibility in working hours and our code of conduct is thorough and fair for all. There are still some challenges however, and through regular employer/employee communications, a number of current vacancies available for all staff to apply for, and by bringing this level of reporting to all parts of the business we will certainly hope to reduce that gap going forwards.”    Dardan Security can confirm that this published information is accurate and signed off by an appropriate person.
