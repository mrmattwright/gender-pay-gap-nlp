We are committed to becoming a more diverse organisation that will better represent the people who play football at every level of the game.  This report contains important information on The FA’s gender pay gap as required by law, as well as additional information which we are voluntarily disclosing and believe provides helpful background and context.  “We take our role in leading the way in football very seriously,” said FA chairman Greg Clarke.  “We are committed to pay equality and believe that pay between comparable employees should be based on merit and never linked to gender.  “We are committed to reducing our gender pay gap further, with a renewed focus of effort and resources on diversity and inclusion initiatives to ensure more women are working at The FA in the future.  “This year we will set and publish BAME and gender targets for all of our organisation and launch initiatives that will ensure that these targets are met.”  “The number of men applying for jobs at the FA is significantly higher than the number of women and so we are working hard to improve the pipeline in the early stages of recruitment to increase the possibility of hiring a more balanced workforce.”  You can read the full report here.
