Employee Communication: Gender Pay Gap Reporting 

 

We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 

This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the 
average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing 
individual employees data. 

We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government 
website. We will do this within one calendar year of April 5th 2018. 

We can use these results to assess: 

the levels of gender equality in our workplace 
the balance of male and female employees at different levels 

 
 
  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded. 

The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender 
pay gap. 

Further details about how we intend to tackle our gender pay gap can be found by: 

talking to your superviser or manager 

 
  contacting your HR department 
  participating in focus groups 
 

looking at our company handbook or website 

Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on 
employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing HR and payroll 
records. All employees can confirm and update their records if they choose to by 
contacting Mr.Paulo Freitas.
