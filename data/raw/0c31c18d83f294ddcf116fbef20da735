From April 2017, all organisations employing over 250 employees are required to publish their Gender Pay Gap (GPG) figures.  The GPG looks at the difference in the average pay of men and women in an organisation.  This is different from Equal Pay which is where men and women are paid the same pay for the same work.  Gentoo pays all employees who are performing the same role equally, regardless of gender or any other protected characteristic.  The information set out below is based on pay data within the Group as at 5 April 2017.               Mean and Median GPG  At Gentoo, the mean (average) difference in pay was 11.1% between men and women, which means the average salary (hourly rate) for men is 11.1% higher than the average salary (hourly rate) for women.   The median difference is 14.6%.  This is the percentage difference between the midpoint male hourly rate and female hourly rate.                   Pay Quartiles  The proportion of males and females within each pay quartile for the Group is shown in the charts below.                    Bonuses at Gentoo  The only staff who received bonuses at Gentoo work within the sales function of Gentoo Homes. Overall, we had  8  employees that received a bonus:   4 male  4 female   As a proportion of the workforce,  0.5%  of the male workforce and  0.8%  of the female workforce received a bonus.  The difference in mean bonus payments within the Group is  27.9%.  The average male bonus payment was  £1,110  compared to  £800  for females.     The median difference in bonus payments within the Group is 13%. The median male bonus payment was £920 compared to £800 for females.                              Why is this?  There are a number of key reasons behind the Group’s GPG data.  Firstly, we have a larger male (60%) workforce than female (40%) workforce.  It is possible that even when you pay all employees equally that an organisation may have a GPG simply as a result of the gender split within the workforce.  This point is emphasised by the significantly higher proportion of males than females currently employed in the upper (71.9%) and upper mid quartiles (75.6%).   We do have some roles within the Upper Mid Quartile that have a significantly higher proportion of male than female staff, and we are reviewing our approach to recruitment in these areas in order to attract greater female representation.  The Group also shows a slightly higher proportion of females in the lower (52%) and lower mid (55.1%).  It is worth noting that when considering the GPG within each quartile the lower mid and upper quartiles show a negative figure, which indicates a GPG in favour of female employees.                  Mitigating the GPG  We have put a number of initiatives in place to mitigate our gender pay gap, this includes:   Talent management.  Salary benchmarking.  Review of our approach to recruitment for trade roles and senior positions to ensure we are able to attract greater female representation within these areas.  Gender monitoring of a range of key people data such as recruitment, internal promotion and talent management initiatives.   Gentoo is committed to the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion and we will continue to monitor our GPG data closely.  The information provided is accurate and was calculated using the methods as set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation.
