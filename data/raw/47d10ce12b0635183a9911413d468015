Commentary:
• There are no significant differences in pay rates for different genders occupying equivalent roles. 
However, the gender pay gap arises as a higher proportion of senior, technical and commission earning 
roles are occupied by men  
• Inenco is committed to addressing the gender pay gap and we have already taken action this year to 
ensure a higher proportion of female employees within the upper quartile pay bands
• At the date of this report, more than 50% of our Leadership Team are now female and we have a higher 
proportion of female employees overall than in April 2017
• We also introduced a new bonus scheme to ensure broader participation across 
the business
• With greater focus going forward on recruitment, training and reward, we aim to 
continue to address the gender pay differential over the coming years

We are committed 
to providing equal 
opportunities in 
employment

More than 50% 
of our Leadership 
Team are female
