This is driven by a highly motivated, skilled and efficient workforce, regardless of gender.   Gender pay is different to equal pay. The MDIS Group is, and will continue to be, an equal opportunities employer and we are confident that both men and woman are paid fairly and equally. Regardless of gender, staff will be paid at the correct market rate, based on similar roles, required qualifications, level of experience and location. The Group uses a structured pay range framework for each role and employees are ‘slotted in’ the framework based upon their previous experience and qualifications relevant to the role.  The MDIS Group has female employees at all levels of the business including professional, management, senior management and Board. Pay gaps within the Group reflect the makeup of our employees; which is due in part to a larger proportion of male employees in the Group who are qualified Building Surveyors. This field of expertise and qualification is at present suffering a lack of newly qualified workers and a historically low level of qualified women choosing to enter this particular field.  In 2012 (28 Aug ’12) The Guardian stated that only 7% of Local Authority Building Control surveyors were female. In 2016, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) reported that only 13% of the workforce in the land, property and built environment profession were female. The number of qualified female building control surveyors working for local authorities has grown a little from figures in 1986, but the proportion today is still a disappointing 15%.  More recently (06 March ’17) the Planning & Building Control Today publication described the challenges within the building and surveying industry of developing a diverse and inclusive profession.  The MDIS Group Remuneration Committee will continue to review salaries to monitor the administration of fairness and equality across all roles.
