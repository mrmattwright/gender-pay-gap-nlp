As at 31st March 2017 

 

 

 

 

1.  Background 

 
Any organisation that has 250 or more employees is now obliged to publish and report specific 
figures about gender pay. The first report uses the snapshot date of 31 March 2017 and must be 
publicly reported by 30 March 2018. A gender pay gap is the difference between the average 
earnings of men and women across an organisation, expressed relative to men’s earnings. 
 

2.  Our commitment to Equality of Opportunity and Inclusion 

 

At  LAS  we  are  committed  to  promoting  equality  of  opportunity  and  diversity  to  enhance  our 
inclusion  work.  LAS  has  committed  to  ensure  that  equality,  diversity  and  human  rights  are 
embedded in all areas of our employment, planning and service delivery. We strive to provide 
excellence  in  all  we  do  and  recognise  the  value  that  Inclusion  brings.  We  are  committed  to 
ensuring that all our employees are treated with dignity and respect and given equal opportunity 
and 
organisation. 
 
We strongly  believe  that  diversity  and  inclusivity  in  all  its  forms  delivers  greater  impact  in  the 
work  we  do  and  enhances  the  services  we  deliver  to  Londoners.   Our  commitment  to  the 
principles of Diversity and Inclusion informs all of our work with our people.

I confirm this gender pay report is accurate and reflects a snapshot of our organisation on 31st 
March 2017. Our figures show that while the London Ambulance Service is doing well at most 
levels, it needs to close the gender pay gap at the higher levels of  the organisation and over 
bonus payments. We are working hard to solve these problems, and we have set up a working 
group to investigate this data and to recommend improvements. 
 
We already have a range of family-friendly policies and our maternity policy is being revised. We 
are training our staff to help them guard against unconscious bias against women, particularly 
for the higher level posts, as female under-representation at higher levels is driving the gender 
pay gap within the London Ambulance Service. We will do all we can to discover and remove 
the barriers which stop women moving into senior posts.

3.  What is the Gender Pay Gap ? 

The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of 
men and women. This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings e.g. women earn 15% 
less than men. Used to its full potential, gender pay gap reporting is a valuable tool for assessing 
levels of equality in the workplace, female and male participation, and how effectively talent is 
being maximised.  

 
4.  The difference between the gender pay gap and equal pay 

The gender pay gap differs from equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between 
men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful 
to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The gender pay gap shows the 
differences in the average pay between men and women. If a workplace has a particularly high 
gender pay gap, this can indicate there may a number of issues to deal with, and the individual 
calculations may help to identify what those issues are.  
 

5.   What does the Gender Pay Audit cover ? 

The audit focuses on comparing the pay of female and male employees and shows the difference 
in earnings. It provides information on the following: 
 
  The mean gender pay gap in hourly pay 
  The median gender pay gap in hourly pay 
  The mean bonus gender pay gap 
  The median bonus gender pay gap 
  The proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment 
  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band

7.    Our gender pay audit data 
 
7.1 The mean and median gender pay gap 
 
The mean gender pay gap adds together the hourly pay rates of all male  and female pay and 
divides this by the respective number of male or female employees.  The gap is calculated by 
taking the difference between the male and female averages and dividing that by the mean hourly 
rate for males. 
 
The median arranges the hourly rates from highest to lowest and finds the point in the middle of 
that range.

7.2 The mean and median bonus gender pay gap 
 
The mean bonus gender pay gap adds together bonus payments for all male and female pay 
and divides this by the respective number of male or female employees.  The gap is calculated 
by taking the difference between the male and female averages and dividing that by the mean 
bonus payment for males. 
 
The median arranges the bonus payments from highest to lowest and finds the point in the middle 
of that range.

8. Gender Pay Gap Reporting Narrative 

 

a.  There  are  moderate  differences  on  average  pay  and  the  proportions  of  males  and 

females who receive bonuses.   
 

b.  Our bonus gap is worth specific comment as it is larger than our regular pay gap.  There 
are several reasons for this. A key reason is that the law requires us to include the actual 
bonus amounts received by part time colleagues, not the full time equivalent.  Given the 
larger proportion of our part time female employees receiving bonuses as compared to 
full  time  females  and  part  time  males,  this  increases  the  bonus  gap.   So,  there  is  a 
disproportionate  effect  on  our  female  employees  as  61%  of  part  time  staff  receiving 
bonuses are women. 
 

c.  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band ranks all the male and 
female  full-pay  relevant  employees  from  the  lowest  hourly  rate  of  pay  to  the  highest 
hourly pay rate and then divides them into quartiles with an equal number of employees 
in each section. The gender proportions in quartiles 1 to 3 are similar to the overall LAS 
gender mix of 45% female and 55% female. There is a proportionately larger number of 
males in quartile 4, the quartile with the highest hourly rates.  This corresponds with the 
overall LAS gender mix for Bands 7 to 8D which is 37% female and 63% male.
