Background 

The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 introduced

  Gender pay gap (mean and median) 
  Gender bonus gap (mean and median) 
  Gender bonus gap (mean and median) 
  Proportion of men and women receiving a bonus payment

The data is based upon the snapshot date of 31 March 2017 with the requirement being for 
the data to be published on the Council’s website and the GOV.UK website by 30 March 
2018 and annually thereafter.

The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in 
the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 

What is the difference between equal pay and gender pay? 

Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same 
jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they 
are a man or a woman.  

Gender pay illustrates the differences in the average pay between men and women. An 
organisation may have a gender pay gap if a majority of men are in top jobs, despite paying 
male and female employees the same rates of pay for similar roles. 

 

 

What are the underlying causes of Epsom & Ewell Borough Council's gender pay 
gap? 

Epsom & Ewell Borough Council is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and 
equal treatment for all employees, regardless of gender, race, religion or belief, age, 
marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment 
or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent 
work, regardless of their gender (or any other characteristic set out above). As such, it: 

  carries out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals 
  evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure 

Epsom & Ewell Borough Council is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem 
from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Its gender pay gap 
is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the 
salaries that these roles attract. 

According to the Government Equalities Office, the causes of the gender pay gap across the 
UK economy as a whole include: 

  A higher proportion of women choosing occupations that offer less financial reward 

(e.g. administration).  

  Many high paying sectors being disproportionately made up of male workers (e.g. 

information and communications technology). 

  A much higher proportion of women working part-time, and part-time workers earning 

less than their full-time counterparts on average. 

  Women being more likely to have had breaks from work which have affected their 

career progression, meaning that they are less likely to have progressed up the 
career ladder into higher paying senior roles. 

However, this pattern from the UK economy as a whole is not reflected in the make-up of 
Epsom & Ewell Borough Council's workforce, where the majority of front-line Operatives are 
men, and where line management and senior management roles are held by a significant 
proportion of women.  

How does Epsom & Ewell Borough Council's gender pay gap compare with that of 
other organisations? 

The vast majority of organisations have a gender pay gap. Epsom & Ewell Borough 
Council's gap compares favourably with that of other organisations, including those within 
our sector. 

What is Epsom & Ewell Borough Council doing to address its gender pay gap? 

Gender pay is not a subject about which Epsom & Ewell Borough Council is complacent, 
and it is committed to doing everything that it can to reduce the gap. However, Epsom & 
Ewell Borough Council also recognises that its scope to act is limited in some areas. It has, 
for example, no direct control over the subjects that individuals choose to study or the career 
choices that they make. 

Epsom & Ewell Borough Council has taken steps to promote gender diversity in all areas of 
its workforce and undertakes gender monitoring on an annual basis to understand:  

 
 
 

 

the proportions of men and women applying for jobs and being recruited 
the proportions of men and women applying for and obtaining internal promotions 
the proportions of men and women leaving the organisation and their reasons for 
leaving 
the numbers of men and women in each role and pay band 

The findings of this report will be published on an annual basis.
