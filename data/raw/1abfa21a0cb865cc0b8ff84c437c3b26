Global Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
Vision
As part of our core values at NetApp, we fully embrace and advance a diverse, inclusive 
global workforce with a culture of belonging that leverages the backgrounds and 
perspectives of all employees, customers, partners, and communities to foster a higher 
performing organization.

Overview
From expanding talent pools and fueling innovation to entering new markets with 
differing product portfolios, we believe that Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging is 
a strategic advantage that increases engagement, performance, market growth 
and productivity. NetApp demonstrates its commitment to diversity, inclusion and 
belonging through a variety of initiatives including:

• Inclusive Leadership Development Initiative

As the global workplace and marketplace becomes increasingly diverse, it is 
imperative for leaders to communicate and work effectively in a cross-cultural, multi-
generational environment. Inclusive leadership drives engagement, innovation, and 
collaboration for business success, while enabling employees to be who they are at 
work, to be authentic in their work and contribute to the success at NetApp.

• Strategic Innovation Partnerships

We seek diverse partnerships and alliances from industry experts that contribute to 
bridging the gap of women and diverse talent in Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics (STEM) related disciplines and senior-leadership positions.

• Global Business Impact Groups(GBIGs)

Global Business Impact Groups(GBIGs) are independent voluntary groups of 
employees that share common interests that foster a diverse, inclusive workplace 
that is aligned with NetApp’s objectives, values and business practices. The 
GBIGs initiatives will assist in impacting key NetApp business drivers and improve 
individual and organizational performance. It is an opportunity to increase employee 
engagement, global cultural competency, develop future NetApp leaders and expand 
external market outreach. 

DatasheetNetApp UK Limited
NetApp UK has approximately 340 employees, (as of snapshot 
date 5th April 2017) based in England and Scotland. Our 
UK Head Office is located in Uxbridge, Middlesex. Our roles 
within the UK organisation are predominantly in Sales and 
Sales Systems Engineering (69%), but also include Customer 
Supporting Roles (19%) and Company Supporting Roles (11%).

NetApp Compensation Philosophy
NetApp evaluates remuneration with no regard to gender, age, 
ethnicity or beliefs. Our compensation philosophy is to pay 
employees competitively within the market we compete in. This 
is done by valuing the level of education, experience, skill and 
responsibilities required to fulfill a specific job or job type and 
remunerating employees accordingly. Our pay is also based 
on performance that provides compensation rewards that are 
directly linked to performance and valued behaviour, which is 
objectively evaluated through NetApp’s annual performance 
program.

Gender Pay Gap Report 
NetApp’s Gender Pay Gap Report shows the overall median 
and mean gender pay and bonus gap, based on hourly rates of 
pay per the snapshot date 5th April 2017, and total bonus pay 
between April 2017 and the 12 months prior.

NetApp UK Workforce

workforce of 340 employees

Our Results
Mean & Median Hourly Gender Pay Gap & Bonus Gap
Our analysis of our gender pay gap report shows that the overall 
difference between our male and female employees’ earnings is 
24.14% (mean) or 29.27% (median).

The IT industry is an industry that attracts more male then 
female employees. This is something that is also experienced 
within NetApp as only 16% of NetApp UK’s total workforce is 
female.  Furthermore, the NetApp UK site is primarily a sales 
office employing far more sales employees than non-sales 
employees.

Our analysis shows that the average mean and median earnings 
difference, between our male and female population, is because 
we have more males than females in our UK office. We have 
more males in senior positions.

The significant difference in the number of male and female 
employees, in addition to the fact that few females are in senior 
roles, highly contributes to the outcome that the average mean 
and median earnings of our male employees is higher.

NetApp is taking active steps in reviewing our compensation 
and ensuring we pay male and female employees equally who 
are in similar jobs with similar skills, experience, education and 
performance.

These charts illustrate the mean (average) and median pay and bonus gap between male and 
female employees irrespective of their role, expressed as a percentage of male employee pay

Non-commission: 69%

Non-commission: 21%

Commission: 31%

Commission: 79%

Within NetApp the variable component of an employee’s pay is 
comprised of either an annual incentive pay or commission pay. 
Both the variable components are included in the calculation of 
the bonus gap, while there are significant differences between 
these two components.

Employees in sales related roles are paid on commission. The 
commission is based on achieving specified goals and sales 
targets, which comprises a significant part of their salary. All 
employees who are not in commissionable functions are eligible 
to receive a discretionary annual incentive payment which 
is based on company performance, job level and individual 
performance.

NetApp Pay Quartiles
This chart illustrates the gender distribution of all NetApp UK employees across four equally 
sized quartiles

NetApp Bonus Participation
The NetApp bonus gap of 40.57% (mean) and 72.09% (median) 
is again due to a higher proportion of male employees versus 
female employees occupying commissionable positions within 
Sales and Sales Systems Engineering roles. As can be seen from 
the overall proportion of employees receiving a bonus, both male 
and female employees have an equal opportunity to participate 
in and earn a bonus at NetApp. 

It is important to further clarify that the bonus snapshot for 
commissionable employees is reflective of actual commission 
paid during the timeline established. Our annual bonus plan for 
non-commissionable employees is paid in July each year for the 
previous fiscal year. Therefore, the data for non-commissionable 
roles, where most all our females are employed, is for the fiscal 
year prior.

This report is good at illustrating the challenge NetApp faces 
in recruiting females from Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics (STEM) related fields. Like many other 
companies within the high-tech industry, NetApp’s gap in 
gender pay is mostly driven by the fact that there are far more 
male employees (84%) within our total UK workforce and that 
the commissionable roles and managerial roles are mostly 
occupied by men. NetApp continues to actively consult, educate, 
and inform our managers with regards to hiring more diverse 
candidates and addressing identified pay gap concerns.
