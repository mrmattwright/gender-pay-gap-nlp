Adrian Flux Insurance  
Gender Pay Gap
Report April 2017

Introduction

We reward employees equally 
for doing equivalent jobs at 
the same level of performance 
and experience, regardless of 
gender.

In fact, our approach to pay  
is gender neutral.

Fairness is one of the main core 
values at Adrian Flux and is at 
the heart of everything we do. 
It is behind how we look after 
our customers and how we treat 
each other in the workplace.

Our strategy on pay is designed 
to attract and motivate the very 
best people, regardless of age, 
ethnicity, gender and disability.

Adrian Flux operates an equal 
pay philosophy across the 
company.

Conclusions

Our analysis shows, that in 
common with nearly all other 
companies our Gender Pay Gap 
is largely driven by the fact that 
a higher proportion of our Senior 
Roles are fulﬁ lled by men (61.2%) 
than by women (38.8%).
Conversely, a higher proportion 
of our more junior roles are 
performed by women (62%) than 
their male counterparts (38%).

Of our Senior Leadership Team, 
38.5% of the positions are held by 
women.

This however rises to 56.9% when 
we look at our junior and middle 
management teams, where 
female managers are in the 
majority. 

Our analysis also shows that the 
ﬁ gures produced, are certainly 
inﬂ uenced by employees who 
work reduced hours. 

the calculation for the gender 
pay bonus gap does not allow 
any adjustment to bring these 
bonuses back to their full time 
equivalent level.
While we encourage both men 
and women to work ﬂ exibly, the 
vast majority of those who have 
chosen to do so are women.

Improving the Gender 
Balance across our business is 
a priority and something that 
the Management team are 
committed in doing.

We are making progress, (as 
can be seen by the increasing 
amount of women in our middle 
& junior management roles).
Improving our Gender Balance 
will take time though and will 
require continuous focus over the 
long term.

All of the ﬁ gures provided in this 
document are accurate.
