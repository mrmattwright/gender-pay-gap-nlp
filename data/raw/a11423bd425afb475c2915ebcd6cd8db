We offer places to undergraduates in line with the University of Oxford’s agreed code of practice and to graduates admitted to the University of Oxford.  The College undertakes to remove any barriers, real or perceived, which might deter people of the highest ability from applying to the College, either as staff or students. The College aims to assist its students and staff in reaching their full potential, and to provide an inclusive environment which values diversity and maintains a working, social and learning environment in which the rights and dignity of all its staff, students and alumni are respected.  Please find the College’s Equality Policy here: Somerville College Equality & Diversity Policy     Gender Pay Gap  Somerville College, which was founded to give opportunities to women, has always believed in promoting equality. The figures that we are publishing today show that Somerville has a mean gender pay gap of 22.0% and a median gender pay gap of 22.9%.  “We are deeply uncomfortable with this gap. We are determined to find out more about the factors behind it, and take action so that we can work towards closing the gap.”  Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, Principal   This does not mean that we pay women less than men for doing the same job. Looking separately at academic staff and support staff, the gaps are much narrower. The mean pay gap for academics is -3.2%, in favour of women, and for support staff it is 8.1%.  Women do hold well-paid leadership roles at Somerville. In the senior management team, three out of five are women, including the Principal Jan Royall.  But we have more men in higher-paid academic roles and more women in lower-paid support roles, which has contributed to the wide headline gap.  Senior academic staff are predominantly male. This is beginning to change in line with our equality action plans. Since 2016, we have recruited six new tutorial fellows at Somerville, of whom four are women.  We will do more over the coming months and years to ensure that our recruitment practices reflect our beliefs.
