Emerald are confident that men and 
women are paid equally for doing 
equivalent jobs across our business. 
The differences in pay highlighted in 
this report are primarily driven by the 
significantly higher proportion of females 
in the lower 2 pay quartiles. We are 
passionate about gender equality and 
the promotion of diversity, as highlighted 
by our internal STRIDE programme. This 
programme explores and promotes 
diversity and inclusion with a strong focus 
on gender diversity and the celebration 
and promotion of women in leadership.

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
