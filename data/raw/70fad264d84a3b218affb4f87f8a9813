Anyone can use this right, and information can only be withheld where FOISA expressly permits it.  FOISA requires Scottish public authorities and publicly owned companies as defined by section 6 to produce and maintain a publication scheme. Authorities and publicly owned companies are under a legal obligation to:   publish the classes of information that they make routinely available  tell the public how to access the information and what it might cost   Fife Sports and Leisure Trust has adopted the Model Publication Scheme produced by the Scottish Information Commissioner. The Commissioner has approved this scheme until 31 May 2019. You can see this scheme on our website or by contacting us at the address below.  It is also available to view on the Scottish Infomation Commissioner website .

You should note, however, that there may be limited circumstances where information will be withheld from one of the classes of information listed in Section 12 – Classes of Information. Information will only be withheld, however, where FOISA (or, in the case of environmental information, the EIRs expressly permits it).  Information may be withheld, for example, where its disclosure would breach the law of confidentiality, harm an organisation’s commercial interests, or endanger the protection of the environment. Information may also be withheld if it is another person’s personal information, and its release would breach the data protection legislation.  Whenever information is withheld we will inform you of this, and will set out why that information cannot be released. Even where information is withheld it may, in many cases, be possible to provide copies with the withheld information edited out. If you wish to complain about any information which has been withheld from you, please refer to Section 10 – Complaints.     SECTION 5: Our Charging Policy  Unless otherwise stated in Section 12 - Classes of Information, all information contained within our scheme is available from us free of charge where it can be downloaded from our website or where it can be sent to you electronically by email.  We reserve the right to impose charges for providing information in paper copy or on computer disc. Charges will reflect the actual costs of reproduction and postage to the authority, as set out below.  In the event that a charge is to be levied, you will be advised of the charge and how it has been calculated.  Information will not be provided to you until payment has been received.   Reproduction costs: Where charges are applied, photocopied information will be charged at a standard rate of 10p per A4 side of paper (black and white copy) and 30p per A4 side of paper (colour copy). Computer discs will be charged at the rate of £1.00 per CD-Rom.   Postage cost: We will pass on postage charges to the requester at the cost to the authority of sending the information by first class post.  There are also a small number of pre-printed publications  for which Fife Sports and Leisure Trust makes a charge. The charges for these are listed in the classes. These documents include Annual Accounts/Business Strategy.  These publications will be charged at the cover price, plus actual postage costs, as charged by the Royal Mail.  The cover price will not exceed the cost, per copy, of having the documents printed. Details of any individual charges which differ from the above charging policy are provided within Section 12 - Classes of Information.

All of this information, unless specifically stated i.e policy documents, can be copied or reproduced without our formal permission, provided it is copied or reproduced accurately, is not used in a misleading context, and provided that the source of the material is identified.  The publication scheme may, however, contain information where the copyright holder is not Fife Sports and Leisure Trust. In most cases the copyright holder will be obvious from the documents. In cases where the copyright is unclear, however, it is the responsibility of the person accessing the information to locate and seek the permission of the copyright holder before reproducing the material or in any other way breaching the rights of the copyright holder.  Wherever possible, this scheme will indicate where we do not own the copyright on documents within Section 12 – Classes of Information.

SECTION 7: Records Management Policy  Introduction Fife Sports and Leisure Trust regards its records as a major asset of the Company. It confirms that its records are one of the essential resources which supports management in the efficient and effective fulfilment of its governance, business and legal responsibilities.   Aim This policy aims to ensure that the Fife Sports and Leisure Trust records are managed soundly, correctly and are in line with recognised standards and accepted good practice.  Records managed by the Fife Sports and Leisure Trust will:   Conform to the Code of Practice on Records Management which has been issued by Ministers in accordance with Section 61 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.  Document and evidence our conduct in respect of:  Legal agreements  Other legislation (eg Employment; Health and Safety)  Business activities. The Policy will also determine, through its operational guidelines, a framework for records management. In doing so, the Fife Sports and Leisure Trust will work towards enhancing the quality of its records management by means of compliance, continuous improvement and review.      What does this Policy apply to? This policy applies to the management of records in whatever format or media it is held in, (ie paper, electronic and tape) received or originated in the furtherance of the business activities of the Fife Sports and Leisure Trust. It includes, although is not limited to: Correspondence, documents, presentations, spreadsheets, data bases, social media blogs, emails, diaries, faxes, promotional / instructive / educational material, reports, website content, forms, audio and video recordings, photographs and physical samples.   Who does this Policy apply to? This policy and the requirements of it are applicable to the Company Directors, the employees of the Company (permanent, temporary and casual). It also includes professional advisors, consultants and contractors who have authorised access to records.   Who is Responsible for the Policy? The implementation, continuance, monitoring and review of the policy is the responsibility of the Chief Executive. Through the scheme of delegation, the Chief Executive will authorise managers and employees to maintain the procedures relating to the record management policy.   Record Ownership Fife Sports and Leisure Trust own all records originated and received by the Directors and employees of the Company when they are derived from or for business related activities. Individuals do not own the records, however they do have a responsibility to ensure that the records are managed correctly.   Principles The Fife Sports and Leisure Trust needs to keep records of business decisions and transactions to meet the demands of corporate accountability. Records are created by the day-to-day work that takes place within the Company. They are the evidence of an activity or transaction and demonstrate accountability. Records are an indispensable element of that accountability. In order to demonstrate proof, records must have the qualities of:   Authenticity - an accurate account of an activity transaction or decision  Integrity - an assurance that the data has not been subsequently changed  Non-repudiation - preventing the originator from disowning the record    These overarching qualitative requirements are supported by the basic principles of:   efficient retrieval of information  identification of length of time records are required for legal or business purposes  cost effective storage of records in the most appropriate form and in adequate storage conditions  secure access to confidential records  effective tracking of the location and case of records from creation to disposal  audit trail of file destruction  disaster recovery programme for vital records  permanent preservation of records of historical, cultural or educational value   Adherence to these principles will enable The Fife Sports and Leisure Trust to retain its corporate memory with regards to its various business activities.   Tracking Effective tracking and retrieval of information is a necessity in order to facilitate business needs and comply with the legislation. Fife Sports and Leisure Trust will ensure that procedures and metadata standards which chronicle the life cycle of the record are sufficient to maintain the identification and retrieval of a record at each stage of its movement from origination through to disposal or permanent archiving.   Retention of Information A retention schedule will be maintained by Fife Sports and Leisure Trust. This is an essential control document which defines the time periods (legislative or business critical) for the various records held.   Storage The nature and range of records required to be retained by Fife Sports and Leisure Trust requires that they be stored with due consideration to:   an environment which is compatible and supports the physical requirements of the record  compliance with legislation  accessibility  appropriate security precautions  retention time periods   These requirements will be considered at every stage of a records existence and not just when it becomes inactive.   Disposal and Destruction The Fife Sports and Leisure Trust retention schedule states the time period that a record requires to be retained to meet business needs and legal requirements. The schedule will also state the action required at the end of the designated period (review, retain for further period, destroy or permanent preservation). The responsibility for authorising the destruction rests with those in posts of Duty Manager and above. A register noting the action taken will be maintained. It will detail:   the record metadata information  the authorisation for destruction or permanent, preservation  the method of destruction  date of destruction  location of permanent preservation In respect of records, consider historical,  educational, culturally interesting or historically important.   The advice of the Fife Archivist will always be obtained before a final decision is made.   Review This policy will be reviewed on a 12 monthly basis and amended to reflect the business needs and the introduction/amendment of legislation of Fife Sports and Leisure Trust.    SECTION 8: Feedback  FOISA requires that we review our publication scheme from time to time.  As we have adopted the Model Publication Scheme 2012, this means we will review our guide to information from time to time.   As a result, we welcome feedback on how we can develop our guide further.

SECTION 10: How to Access Information Which is Not Available Under The Model Publicaton Scheme 2012  If the information you are seeking is not available under the Model Publication Scheme 2012 (and described in this guide)  then you may wish to request it from us.  FOISA provides you with a right of access to the information we hold, subject to certain exemptions. The EIRs separately provide a right of access to the environmental information we hold, while the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides a right of access to any personal information about you that we hold. Again, these rights are subject to certain exceptions or exemptions. Should you wish to request a copy of any information that we hold that is not available under the Model Publication Scheme 2012 (and described in this guide), please write to:  Gail Giraldas, Business Co-ordinator Fife Sports and Leisure Trust Music Institute East Port Dunfermline, KY12 7JA   Charges for information which is not available under the scheme: The charges for information which is available under the Model Publication Scheme 2012  are set out in this guide under Section 5 – Our Charging Policy. If you submit a request to us for information which is not available in this guide the charges will be based on the following calculations:  General information requests:   There will be no charge for information requests which cost us £100 or less to process.  Where information costs between £100 and £600 to provide you may be  asked to pay 10% of the cost. That is, if you were to ask for information that  cost us £600 to provide, you would be asked to pay £50, that calculated on the basis of a waiver for the first £100 and 10% of the remaining £500.  We are not obliged to respond to requests which will cost us over £600 to process.  In calculating any fee, staff time will be calculated at actual cost per staff member hourly salary rate to a maximum of £15 per person per hour.  We do not charge for the time to determine whether we hold the information requested, nor for the time it takes to decide whether the information can be   released. Charges may be made for locating, retrieving and providing information to you.  In the event that we decide to impose a charge we will issue you with notification of the charge (a fees notice) and how it has been calculated. You  will have three months from the date of issue of the fees notice in which to   decide whether to pay the charge. The information will be provided to you on   payment of the charge. If you decide not to proceed with the request there will be no charge to you.    Charges for environmental information: We do not charge for the time to determine whether we hold the information requested, or deciding whether the information can be released. Charges may be made for locating, retrieving and providing information to you e.g. photocopying and postage. In the event that we decide to impose a charge we will issue you with notification of the charge and how it has been calculated. The information will be provided to you on payment of the charge. If you decide not to proceed with the request there will be no charge to you.  Charges are calculated on the basis of the actual cost to the authority of providing the information.   Photocopying is charged at 10p per A4 sheet for black and white copying, 30p per A4 sheet for colour copying.  Postage is charged at actual rate for first class mail.  Staff time is calculated at actual cost per staff member hourly salary rate to a maximum of £15 per person per hour.   The first £100 worth of information will be provided to you without charge.  Where information costs between £100 and £600 to provide you will be asked to pay 10% of the cost. That is, if you were to ask for information that cost us £600 to provide, you would be asked to pay £50, that calculated on the basis of a waiver for the first £100 and 10% of the remaining £500. Where it would cost more than £600 to provide the information to you, however, we will ask you to pay the full cost of providing the information, with no waiver for any portion of the cost.   Charge for request for your own personal data The charge is a standard fee of £10.00 plus any reproduction and postage costs (both on the same basis as for FOI requests).

According to CIPD research, the gender pay gap exists because women tend to work in lower-paid occupations and sectors, and occupy less senior roles. Many women take time out of the labour market and work part-time because of unequal sharing of care responsibilities. Stereotypes and workplace culture are also factors.
