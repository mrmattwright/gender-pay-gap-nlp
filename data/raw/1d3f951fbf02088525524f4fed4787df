Welcome from our HR Director

At East Midlands Trains we embrace 
diversity and aim to be an inclusive 
employer where everyone feels equal  
and valued. As an accredited Top  
Employer, we welcome the government’s 
initiative to introduce gender pay gap 
reporting legislation.

where 90% and 94% respectively of colleagues are male. 
A third of our executives and nearly half (46%) of our 
customer service colleagues are women.

We will remain focused on achieving a diverse and 
inclusive culture that is representative of the communities 
that we serve and take practical steps to improve our 
gender balance.

Our analysis shows that there is an overall difference 
between men and women’s earnings of 24% (mean) and 
23% (median), based on the hourly rates of pay as of 5th 
April 2017. We are clear that gender does not influence 
what we pay and the pay gap is primarily caused by 
the disproportionate number of men in highly paid 
engineering and train driving roles.

In 2016, women made up 20% of employees in the 
whole rail sector and 4.4% of employees working in rail 
engineering disciplines. In 2017 men made up 89% of 
people working in engineering across all sectors.

Overall our workforce is split 70% male and 30% 
female. The disproportionate number of men increases 
significantly in our engineering and train driving roles

Working to close the gap

Our aim is to achieve an improvement 
in our gender pay gap. We are confident 
that as the gender balance in our 
engineering and driving roles improves, 
our gender pay gap will reduce. Our 
relatively low employee turnover and 
lower proportion of STEM female students 
in subjects leading to engineering courses 
means that this is a long term aim.

Some of the work that we have already done to close 
the gap includes:
› ‘Blind screening’ of candidate CVs to help tackle 
unconscious bias in the recruitment process
› Training for managers on unconscious bias in 
recruitment
› Targeted recruitment campaigns to attract female 
trainee drivers and women only career open days to 
learn more about train driving
› Gender coded job adverts to increase appeal to 
women
› Active membership of Women In Rail, the national 

volunteer organisation that aims to increase the 
number of women working in the rail sector

› Use of an internationally time-tested job evaluation 
methodology for measuring management jobs by 
relative size, nature and importance for all levels

› Monitoring and reporting on gender for recruitment

Words from our Managing Director

I want East Midlands Trains to reflect the customers 
and communities that we serve not just because 
it is the right thing to do but because gender 
balance and diversity more broadly will help us 
to carry on delivering great performance. I am 
incredibly proud that we are one of the UK’s best 
long distance train operators and by attracting and 
retaining the best people from the widest possible 
talent pool we will continue to be the best.
