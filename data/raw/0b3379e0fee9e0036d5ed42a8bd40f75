to our residents. We’ve recently been 
named the best council to work for and 
we remain committed to further building 
and sustaining a diverse and inclusive 
workforce for the future.

We will continue to encourage and 
support employees to develop and share 
their talents, strengths and skills to reach 
their full potential. We’ve already taken 
significant steps to support this which has 
included introducing the Wigan Living 
Wage supplement and actively supporting 
and encouraging flexible working 
practices. We also nurture new talent for 
employees early in their careers through 
our Bright Sparks programme and we 
are continuing to invest in staff training, 
development and skills including more 
opportunities than ever before to complete 
an apprenticeship qualification.

Foreword

I’m delighted that our gender pay gap 
reporting highlights that we have a 
positive result at Wigan Council and I’m 
fully committed to sustaining this for the 
future.

Gender equality is something which I am 
incredibly passionate about. It’s not only a 
women’s issue, it affects everyone - men 
and women, as well as our children and 
young people who will shape our future. 
Our #BelieveinHer campaign, which we 
launched in Wigan a few years ago, aims 
to raise awareness of gender inequality 
and encourages people to take action 
against this. We’ve highlighted many 
male and female role models in our 
local communities who’ve supported the 
campaign which has been used to inspire 
others across the borough and help 
address issues of sexism.

At Wigan Council, staff are truly our 
greatest asset and without them and 
their fantastic contributions we couldn’t 
deliver our 700+ services each day

Introduction
Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to 
publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their 
male and female employees. 

The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the average earnings of 
men and women across the organisation. It is expressed as a percentage of men’s 
earnings. As an organisation, the council is committed to addressing any inequalities 
and undertake work to narrow any gaps. 

The GPG is different to equal pay which ensures that men and women in the same 
employment performing equal work must receive equal pay, as set out in the Equality 
Act 2010.

Council salaries are determined through the Gauge job evaluation scheme for National 
Joint Council posts and through the Hay scheme for Senior Manager posts. The Job 
Evaluation process evaluates the job rather than the individual. It makes no reference 
to gender or any other personal characteristics of existing or potential job holders.  We 
also have a number of roles outside these grades that we have inherited during TUPE 
transfers and specialist roles which sit outside the remit of job evaluation e.g. Education 
Psychologists and Central Teachers.  As an organisation the council is confident that we 
are paying the same salary to roles of equal value. 

The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 state that 
organisations are required to capture data as a snapshot on 31 March 2017 and then 
publish their findings no later than 30 March 2018. This cycle will then continue year 
on year going forward with organisations being required to maintain the data on their 
websites for three years in order to show progress made. 

Our Data

The data included within our report represents the gender pay gap data for Wigan 
Council (exc. schools) as at the end of March 2017. 

As an organisation we no longer operate a bonus scheme for any of our positions. We 
continue to pay a living wage supplement to staff that fall below the hourly rate of £8.25 
which means that with the exception of apprentices, all staff receives a minimum hourly 
rate of £8.25.

Our existing workforce has a headcount of 4,258 staff, with a large percentage (70%) 
being female. Just under half of our workforce (41%) are part time. Over half of our 
senior management team are female. (54%).

Bonus

Wigan removed the use of bonus pay in 2008 prior to the introduction of the new pay 
and grading structure implemented in 2009.  However, the council formally recognise 
and reward employees for their long term loyalty, service and commitment. The 
Loyalty Reward scheme rewards employees at key milestones during an individual’s 
employment with the council. The payment is the same irrespective of gender and is 
based purely on length of continuous service. 

The schemes milestones and corresponding reward values are set out as follows:

Based on the loyalty rewards issued between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 the

It should be noted that these results do not portray a true reflection of the loyalty reward 
scheme as there is no gender bias within the scheme. Based on the mean bonus 
results, figures appear slightly higher for male employees, however, this is not the case. 
It should be noted that only 28% of male received a bonus during the period, compared 
to 72% female therefore proportionately, as reward values are the same irrespective of 
gender, the organisation does not have any cause for concern in this area. The loyalty 
reward bonus pay is expected to change year on year and is wholly dependent upon 
service milestone of individual employees being achieved.   

The average bonus value of bonus pay is very similar for males and females.

The quartile data has been calculated by dividing the workforce into four equal sized 
groups. These four groups will be separated according to the hourly pay rate, starting 
from lowest paid to the highest paid. 70% of the Wigan workforce are female.  The 
information below shows that this is reflected consistently across the grades when they 
are split into quartiles.

Conclusion

The overall gender pay gap within the organisation is encouraging. The workforce profile 
contains a higher percentage of females which supports the results, however, the out-
come also demonstrates a non-gender bias across all grade ranges including the senior 
management structure. 

Whilst there are no immediate areas of concern, the organisation is committed to ensure 
that the position remains positive.
