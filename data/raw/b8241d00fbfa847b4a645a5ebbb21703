A gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in the average pay of men and women, regardless of the nature of their work, across an entire organisation. Publishing our Gender Pay Gap Report is a really important step forward because if we are transparent about pay, and identify the root causes of any pay gap, we can find the right solutions to build a better business.
