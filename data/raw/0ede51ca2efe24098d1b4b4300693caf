GENDER PAY 
GAP REPORT
2017

As part of the Equality Act 2010, the UK 
government implemented an Annual 
Gender Pay Gap reporting requirement 
where all companies with more than 250 
employees are required to participate. 

The data shared must include mean and 
median figures for differences in hourly pay 
and bonus pay, which are calculated using 
salaries and bonus payments for all roles in 
Capita regardless of level.  It is important to 
note that this is different to equal pay which 
looks at salaries for jobs with the same or 
similar responsibilities.

We have reported on 28 legal entities 
that meet the reporting criteria as well as 
information for our pay gap covering our 
whole business. Results for each of these 
entities can be found in this report and on the 
government website. The information below 
takes a look at our pay gap covering our entire 
Capita population.  

REPORTING CAPITA’S GENDER PAY GAP

The table below shows our mean and median 
hourly gender pay gap (based on hourly rates 
of pay at 5 April 2017) and mean and median

months to 5 April 2017).

ANALYSING CAPITA’S GENDER  
PAY GAP

Analysis of the data behind our mean pay 
gap of 26.8%, shows us that the gap can 
be attributed to two key factors. The first 
is that there are more men in senior roles, 
including at board level. Senior positions at 
Capita generally offer higher salaries and 
bonus potential. At the same time, there 
are more women than men in the roles 
attracting the lower salaries. 

A gender pay gap such as this is not the 
same as equal pay. Equal pay ensures that 
both male and females are paid in line with 
each other for roles that they do which are 
the same or similar. Gender pay is in place 
to assess the differentials between men and 
women in the organisation, regardless of 
job role, level or salary.

OUR COMMITMENT AND ACTIONS

Capita is committed to addressing the current 
gender pay gap as part of creating an inclusive 
and diverse culture which will enable our 
people and company to thrive with creativity, 
innovation and success. We want a diverse 
workforce that reflects our customer base 
and the communities that we serve.  The 
appointment of Will Serle, Chief People 
Officer, will enable Capita to focus on creating 
the right environment and improving the 
diversity of Capita.

We recognise that we have work to do 
to encourage more women into senior 
leadership roles. 

We are committed to improving opportunities 
for career progression for women into 
senior roles. Our support and membership 
of the 30% Club, which targets 30% of our 
board members to be female, reflects this 
commitment.  

Other key actions include:

Supporting career progression – Our 
30% Club membership will provide 
access to cross-company and cross-sector 
mentoring opportunities, adding to our 
existing mentoring and coaching. We will be 
progressing five mentors and five mentees 
into the 30% Club who will be matched with 
peers at external companies. This process 
has been successful for a number of FTSE 
companies in achieving higher percentage of 
women on board seats. 

Female Leadership Group – Senior women 
from across the company have been 
working to implement initiatives that 
encourage and support female leadership at 
Capita. This group has focused on creating 
wider networking groups, welcoming and 
supporting new women leaders with a buddy 
as well as identifying and encouraging the 
right behaviours which encourages a diverse 
and inclusive culture.

Reviewing recruitment processes – We 
are reviewing our recruitment processes, 
including language used in job descriptions 
and job adverts, to ensure we can encourage 
and attract as diverse a range of applicants. 
Gender bias screening will help in making 
roles in IT, sales and consultancy appealing 
to all.  

Succession planning – Regular succession 
planning identifies future leadership talent 
across the business, ensuring that both male 
and female candidates are identified. Through 
this process we can start to take the necessary 
steps to ensure our successor pipelines are 
diverse and high potentials are given the 
support and training that they need to take 
the next step in their career.
