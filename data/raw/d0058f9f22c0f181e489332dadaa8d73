• GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017BACKGROUND

As we have more than 250 employees 
in the UK, we’re required to publish 
our gender pay gap. The pay gap 
information in this report is based 
on a snapshot of WWF-UK data 
from 5 April 2017. It’s been checked 
independently for accuracy. 

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?
The gender pay gap looks at the difference between 
the average hourly earnings of all the men and all 
the women in an organisation, regardless of the 
nature of their work. 

It’s not the same as equal pay, which is 
about comparing the pay of men and women 
carrying out the same or comparable jobs. 

WHAT CAUSES THE GENDER PAY GAP?
The causes of the gender pay gap are complex, but 
one of the main reasons in our society is that men 
are still more likely to be in high paying senior 
roles. Women are more likely to be in occupations 
that offer less financial reward and in lower paying 
sectors of our economy. They are also more likely 
than men to be employed in part-time roles, which 
are often lower paid.

GENDER PAY GAP
We’ve compared both the mean (average) and 
median (mid-point) in the hourly rate we paid to 
men and women on 5 April 2017. At the time our 
gender pay gap was calculated, 68% of our employees 
were female and 32% were male. This profile is 
similar to the not-for-profit sector as a whole, where 
the workforce is predominantly female.

The table below shows that both our mean and 
median gender pay gaps – the percentage amount 
that men’s pay is higher than women’s pay – are 
broadly in line with the UK economy as a whole.

GENDER BONUS GAP
We’ve also compared the mean and median bonus 
payments we made to men and women in the 12 
months to April 2017. Our mean and median bonus 
gaps are significantly lower than the UK economy 
as a whole.

We give bonuses to very few employees, but our pay 
policy allows us to give small lump-sum pay awards 
to individuals who are either at the top of their pay 
grade or who have delivered a special project or 
activity particularly well.

The number of women receiving a bonus was higher 
than the number of men, with 5.3% of our male 
employees receiving a bonus payment and 7% of our 
female employees.

The pay quartiles shown in the diagram below are 
calculated by listing the rates of pay for every employee 
from lowest to highest, before splitting that list into four 
equal-sized groups and calculating the percentage of 
males and females in each. 

The pay quartile data shows that we have very few male 
employees in our lower pay quartiles. The proportion of 
men increases as rates of pay increase.

• GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017WHAT DO THE RESULTS TELL US?

Our gender pay gap is created by the differences in the 
proportion of men and women employed at various 
levels in our organisation. Our more junior roles are 
predominantly held by women, with proportionally more 
men being employed in our more senior level roles.
This is illustrated in the diagram below, which shows the 
gender breakdown for each of our salary levels.

The shape of our organisation also results in our gender 
bonus gap, with the average bonus payment for men being 
slightly higher than that of the average awarded to women. 
This is because our bonus payments are based on a 
percentage of salary and, as men tend to be in more senior 
roles, the bonus payments awarded to them reflect their 
higher salaries.

• GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING OUR GENDER PAY GAP?

We’re committed to driving down our gender pay gap. We’ve already seen a fall 
in our mean gender pay gap, which we’ve nearly halved from 22.4% in April 
2016 to 12.9% in January 2018. The actions outlined below, which we’re taking 
to address our gender pay gap, are part of our wider programme to ensure that 
WWF-UK is a diverse and inclusive organisation. 

PROGRESSION
 We want to ensure that both men and women 
are more evenly represented at all levels in our 
organisation. We have a female chief executive 
and many of our senior roles are already held 
by women. We’re committed to supporting all 
our people in progressing their career at WWF 
and to offering equal opportunities for all, 
regardless of gender.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT
 We provide learning and development support 
to all. This includes a career development 
programme, plus coaching and mentoring 
opportunities to build skills and confidence.

FLEXIBLE WORKING
 We support all forms of flexible working, on 
both a formal and informal basis, for all our 
people. This is part of our wider approach to 
ensuring that WWF is an inclusive organisation 
and there are no barriers to progression.

JUNIOR ROLES
 We’re trying to make junior roles more 
attractive to a diverse pool of candidates. For 
example, an apprenticeship programme we’ve 
developed in our Supporter Services team 
resulted in the appointment of both a male and 
a female apprentice. 

RECRUITMENT
We’ve launched a new management 
development programme, which includes 
recruitment training, to ensure that all our 
managers are trained in non-discriminatory 
recruitment practices. And we’re taking steps 
to ensure that our vacancies are attractive to a 
more diverse pool of applicants.

DIVERSITY TASK FORCE
 We have a diversity task force with people from 
across the organisation who focus on finding 
new ways we can become a more diverse and 
inclusive organisation.

• GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017DIRECTOR STATEMENT

This report shows that the average pay of our 
male employees is higher than the average pay of 
our female employees. The discrepancy is largely 
the result of men being underrepresented in our 
junior, lower paid roles, while being more evenly 
represented in our senior, higher paid roles. 

We’re keen to have a more even distribution of both 
sexes across all levels in our organisation and to this 
end we have a range of actions in place to ensure 
WWF-UK is a diverse and inclusive employer. 

This report covers all the employees of WWF-UK,
at all levels, including our executive team.

As director of human resources for WWF-UK,
I confirm that the information contained in this 
report is accurate.
