Accord leads the sector on sustainability and we strive to minimise our impact on the environment by continually looking at ways in which we can save energy, minimise waste, protect wildlife and prevent pollution.  Local Homes Accord made history five years ago when it became the first housing association in the country to open a factory manufacturing low carbon advanced housing manufactured (AHM) timber homes. LoCaL Homes is a timber frame manufacturer that produces high performance closed and open panel housing systems. The homes are designed and manufactured to provide flexible solutions that can be tailored to individual needs and functions. This includes everything from floor layout and external finishes, to building form and shape. The housing products are low cost to build, fast to erect, reduce on-site waste, reduce traffic movements and offer the residents living in the homes lower running costs than brick and block built properties.  Fairness Our existence as a social organisation has its origins in commitment to fairness and social justice. Our customers are living in some of the most hyper-diverse wards across the country and we work with people from many different nationalities as well as people who have physical disabilities and mental ill health and others who are vulnerable in different ways. We understand that different people need different things and it’s about providing services and opportunities which are fair but which are delivered in the appropriate way to that individual or community. We are also committed to developing an organisational culture that values people as individuals, recognising the contribution each person can make.
