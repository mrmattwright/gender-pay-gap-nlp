This is fundamental to creating a more innovative and high performing company for the future.  We welcome the introduction of the Gender Pay Gap reporting by the government. It gives us the opportunity to share the work we are already doing to address our gap, assess our progress against our peers and learn from other organisations.  It has been estimated the gender pay gap in the UK might not close until 2040. We are determined it won’t take that long for Bristan Group.
