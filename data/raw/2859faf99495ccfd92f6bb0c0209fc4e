As an employer with 250 employees or more, we are required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. These calculations will show how large the pay 
gap is between male and female employees. 

As an umbrella payroll company, we have split our population in two, both our umbrella employees and our Head 
Office staff. This report is based on pay data as at 5th April 2017 and involves the standard six calculations required 
by law to show the difference between the average earnings of men and women.

Written Statement 

Clipper Contracting Group engages thousands of contractors on assignments across the UK within several sectors 
including construction and IT. We employ these workers through our Umbrella solutions on contract assignments, 
most of which are found through recruitment agencies. 

For our Head Office employees, the results are indicative of our largely female workforce, of which women also 
make up most of our more senior roles throughout the business.  

The results of our umbrella employees reflect that the main sector Clipper Contracting operates in is construction; 
much of our workforce is male. For instance, a large part of this construction workforce consists of labourers who 
are lower paid and dominated by male workers. The rate of pay of women we employ is typically higher than many 
of these labourers and this helps explain why women’s earnings are higher overall. 

The challenge in our company is to reduce any gender pay gap and Clipper Contracting can confirm that it does not 
discriminate when taking on employees and establishing pay rates. We provide equal opportunities to men and 
women and talent is recognised throughout the business.
