On this day, members are encouraged to wear orange to show their solidarity with US educators and unionists demanding action on gun control in their country. The Union is also encouraging members to observe a moment of silence at 11.20 am in memory of the victims of school shootings, and to share this with colleagues in their schools. Please take photos of any action taken and share with the Union via social media. Click here for suggested tweets.
