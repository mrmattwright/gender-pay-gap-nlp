The following types of figures must be reported: mean (average) and median (the mid-point in a range) gender pay gap in hourly pay mean (average) and median (the mid-point in a range) and median bonus gender pay gap proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment proportion of males and females in each pay quartile The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings. Thomas Miller’s UK gender pay gap is 45%.  Our analysis shows that our gender pay gap is driven primarily by the fact that a significantly higher proportion of senior roles are occupied by men (86%) as opposed to women (14%). Conversely a higher percentage of lower paid roles are occupied by women (58%) as opposed to men (42%). The higher proportion of men in senior roles also explains the bonus pay gap as bonus is based on a percentage of salary.
