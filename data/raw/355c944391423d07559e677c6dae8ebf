UK GENDER PAY 

GAP DATA 

APRIL 2017

“LinkedIn has a gender pay gap in the UK as we have more men 
in senior sales roles than women. We are disappointed in these 
results. We need to and are committed to doing better. Our goal is 
to have a balanced organisation at all levels and to create equal 
career opportunities for the women and men at our company.”

Josh Graff, LinkedIn UK Country Manager

Gender Pay vs Equal Pay 

The Gender Pay Gap is not the same as Equal Pay. At LinkedIn we regularly 

review and evaluate our pay practices to ensure all our employees are paid fairly 

regardless of their gender.

Gender Pay Gap

Gender Pay Gap is the difference 
between what male and female 
employees are paid at all levels. 
This is measured by calculating 
the average earnings of male and 

female employees.

Equal Pay

Measures whether male and 
female employees are being 

paid equally for similar work and 

experience.

What the numbers tell us

This Gender Pay Gap is strongly influenced by our  

UK workforce structure.

We have a 

balanced workforce 
with a 50/50 split of men 
and women in our overall 
UK employee base. We have 
been hiring an equal number 

of men and women for 

some time.

We have more  

men than women  
in senior sales roles  
which typically attract 

higher bonus 
opportunities. 

The bonus pay gap 
is a direct result of not 
enough women in 
senior sales roles.

We have more  

men than women  

in senior roles.

What we are doing to eradicate the Gender Pay Gap

“We are not where we want to be, but we are 
focused on solving this issue. We have made 
changes to our hiring practices to bring more 
senior women into the business as well as 
introduced programmes that identify and 
support our existing female talent, to create  
a better internal pipeline of senior women.” 

Bridget Gisby,  

HR Director, LinkedIn UK

Unconscious Bias Training

All senior managers undertook unconscious bias training in 2016.  

In 2018 this was completed by all employees in the UK office.

Family Friendly Policies  

In 2017 we increased our paid leave benefits for mums and dads to  

improve the gender balance of roles played in the workplace and at home.

Women in Leadership Programme

For several years now we have been running management training programmes 

for women of high potential. This course addresses some of the issues that 

surround and prevent women getting to more senior level roles and we aim to 

increase our employee participation in it in the future.  

A Gender Pay Aware Recruitment Process

• We aim to include women candidates in the shortlist for every job

• We aim to have women interviewers present on the panel for every job

• We have refined our pay bands to reduce impact of negotiations on starting salary

• We no longer ask for prior salaries during recruitment

I confirm that LinkedIn has produced its Gender Pay  

Gap calculations in accordance with the requirements of  

The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information)  

Regulations 2017 and that the calculations are accurate  

at the time of publishing.
