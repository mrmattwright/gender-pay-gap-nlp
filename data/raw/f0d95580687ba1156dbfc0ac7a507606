It is  a  well-known fact that  women  account for a far  smaller  share of 
employees  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry.  At  Halliburton,  we  work  to 
address  the  gender  imbalance  throughout  the  career  development 
cycle from entry level, mid-career and senior management. 
 
Diversity  and  inclusion  are  central  to  the  long-term  success  of  the 
Company.  Embedded  in  our  Code  of  Business  Conduct  and  in  our 
employment  practices  is  a  commitment  to  involve  all  employees  in 
creating  a  positive  work  environment  for  everyone.  We  encourage  a 
global  culture  of 
internal  campaign 
highlighting the value of differing perspectives. 
 
Halliburton strives to have an organization that is representative of the 
communities  in  which  we  work  in  and  provide  a  work  environment 
where  everyone  feels  respected,  is  treated  fairly  and  is  provided  an 
equal opportunity to perform at their highest potential. We respect and 
acknowledge  differences  that  enrich  our  workforce  potential,  global 
communities  and  competitive  edge  whilst  creating  sustainable 
business results. 
 
This  report  covers 
the 
Government  Equalities  Office  in  the  UK  and  whilst  we  recognize  the 
data variation, we are committed to developing diversity at Halliburton.  
Our policies are designed to ensure equal pay for equivalent job levels, 
regardless of gender.
