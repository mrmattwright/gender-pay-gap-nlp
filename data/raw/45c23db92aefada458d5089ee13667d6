GENDER
PAY GAP
R E P O R T

As an organisation with more than 250 employees, we are 
publishing our Gender Pay gap, annually. Gender Pay gap is defined 
as the difference in the average earnings for men and women over 
a standard period of time, regardless of role or seniority. At Stewart 
Milne Group, we have a median gender pay gap of 18.1% just under 
the national comparison of 18.4%. However, we must work to close 
the gap and increase representation of women across our business.

Our industry continues to suffer from female 
underrepresentation, particularly in senior 
management. Stewart Milne Group aim to 
address this by promoting positive career 
options across a wide range of roles for women 
joining our company, and our industry, and 
supporting their development to senior roles.

As an industry, failing to take action is not an 
option, we need to realise the benefits of great 
diversity and attract more women throughout 
all career paths.  We have achieved equal pay 
for equal work and by working with schools, 
colleges and universities I am confident we 
can have the same positive impact and build a 
more diverse workforce.

As CEO of Stewart Milne Group Limited, I am authorised to confirm that the information published in this report is in accordance with regulation 2 of the Equality Act (2010) 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) regulations 2017 is correct.

Measuring the pay gap

The data is a reflection of both men and 
women in each 25% (quarter) of an 
organisation’s pay structure. To ensure 
complete accuracy we engaged an 
independent company to run our data 
(Paydata Limited).

Median gender pay gap : difference between 
the median (middle) value of hourly pay rates 
(lowest to highest) for all men and median 
hourly pay rates for all women, expressed as a 
percentage of the median hourly rate for men.

Mean gender pay gap : difference between the 
mean (average) hourly pay rate for all men and 
mean hourly pay rate for all women, expressed 
as a percentage of the mean hourly rate for 
men.

Understanding our Gender Pay Gap

Gender pay gap is not about equal pay for men and women 
carrying out similar or work of equal value.  Gender pay 
compares the average pay by gender of all roles collectively, 
regardless of level or type.  Our figures take account of both 
part-time and full-time employees.

Equal pay does not contribute to our gender pay gap, but it 
does raise awareness of the representation of women in the 
industry – particularly in senior roles.  Our current overall 
representation is 79.2% male and 20.7% female.

The gap is primarily driven by large numbers of men 
working on construction sites and in manufacturing, which 
is consistent with demographics in our industry as a whole. 
Perceptions about a building site environment & shift patterns 
in manufacturing resulting in unsociable hours both tend to 
attract more men than women.  With less women entering 
our industry, currently women make up 1% of all construction 
apprenticeships; this impacts on the number of female’s 
occupying senior leadership roles.  Our male female split is 
84.2% male and 15.8% female at senior leadership level.

The Bonus Gap

MEDIAN BONUS PAY GAP
This is the difference between the median (middle) value of 
bonuses (lowest to highest) for all men in an organisation and 
the median value of bonuses of all women, as a percentage of 
the median bonus for men.

MEAN BONUS PAY GAP
This is the difference between the mean (average) value of 
bonuses for all men in an organisation and the mean value of 
bonuses for all women, expressed as a percentage of the mean 
bonus for men.

Our median bonus pay gap of -364%, is driven by a higher 
proportion of women in sales related roles than men and these 
roles attract higher levels of bonus through commission.

Distribution of Gender
across four equal quartiles of pay from lowest 25% of earners to highest 25% of earners* 

The data is calculated by taking all the hourly rates, lowest to 
highest, divide into four equal sections : lower, lower middle, 
upper middle and upper.

Calculating the number of men and women at each 25% pay 
band as a percentage of all employees within that pay band.

Across the UK women make up only 11% of the construction 
workforce.  Our figures mirror this, demonstrating we need to 
market the great career opportunities available in our industry 
and our business to attract more women and ensure we then 
provide supporting policies to retain them throughout their 
career into senior leadership roles.

Closing the Gender Pay Gap

DIVERSITY TRAINING : We have rolled out Diversity & Respect training to all our employees  to 
highlight unconscious bias to ensure we create a safe and supportive working environment for all 
our employees irrespective of age; gender or ethnicity.

LEADERSHIP TRAINING : We continue to run our award winning programme, Managing 
People For Growth, as an essential skill for all our Line Managers and those who may have this 
responsibility in the future.

ENCOURAGING WOMEN INTO THE INDUSTRY : We will continue working in partnership with 
Schools, Colleges and Universities to move towards a 50:50 gender split for all work experience; 
Foundation, Modern and Graduate Apprentice schemes.  

Positive career path opportunities

MARIANNE EVANS

I joined Stewart Milne Group as Planning Manager some 13 years ago and have progressed my 
career to Area Director (Strategic Land).  

During that 13 year period I have had 3 promotions and working as a team with SMG’s support I 
was able to take 6.5 months maternity leave when my beautiful daughter was born.

Being an Area Director within what is normally known as a ‘male dominated’ industry I definitely 
feel I have a responsibility to act as a role model for other women considering our industry as a 
career option.

ABBIE DUTHIE

In my final year of Highers I knew that University was not the next step for me. I wanted to leave 
school and do something interesting using my maths skills. I applied for an Apprentice Quantity 
Surveyor and was accepted. Over the years I completed an HNC and was delighted to be given 
the opportunity to complete my degree, definitely a ‘work and learn’ opportunity.

My first year was spent completing my HNC at Inverness College on Block release where I would 
be at college for 4 weeks constantly twice a year for 2 years returning  to my role in the Stewart 
Milne office between blocks. In my first year, as I had no prior experience of working in the 
construction industry, I spent much of my time shadowing the Quantity Surveyors in their role 
and putting what I had learned into practice. My training was built up in a way that then allowed 
me to  assist the QS’s with the projects they were running which then gave me a good platform 
for when it came to running my own projects. After spending 3.5 years working with the Stewart 
Milne Homes Commercial team I was then able to transfer from our Homes Division into our 
Timber Frame Manufacture Division, learning a new set of skills in my chosen profession.
