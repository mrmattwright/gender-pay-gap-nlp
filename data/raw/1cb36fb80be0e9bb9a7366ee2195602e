The Glendale mean (average) gender pay gap is 6.10% and the median (average) gender pay gap is 2.07%.  The Gender Pay Gap is different from "equal pay".  Equal pay related to men and women being paid differently for "like work" carrying out the same or comparable jobs.  At Glendale, women and men in like for like roles are remunerated equally.  In the 2017 reporting period, Glendale had an overall gender split of 89% male and 11% female.  In common with other employers in the industry sector, Glendale is working to improve the gender balance amongst the workforce.  We aim to make Glendale a great place for everyone to work, regardless of gender, and to be rewarded fairly.  We are committed to ensuring we have a diverse, gender-balanced workforce where everyone can succeed.
