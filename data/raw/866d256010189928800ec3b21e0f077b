Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that it is largely driven by the fact that there are more 
men in senior higher paid roles within the business as demonstrated by the pay quartiles below.

The images above illustrate the gender distribution at Portsmouth Water across four equally 
sized quartiles. Within these quartiles we are confident that men and women are paid equally 
for doing equivalent jobs across our business. As set out above, at April 2017 the gender pay 
gap is 14.7%. We will continue to monitor the gender pay gap balance throughout the business 
including ensuring the correct recruitment and selection processes are in place making sure the 
correct person is appointed regardless of gender.

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
