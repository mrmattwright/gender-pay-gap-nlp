Pay Quartiles By Gender    Band  Males  Females  Description    A  56.7%  43.3%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile    B  45.2%  54.8%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile    C  37.5%  62.5%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at or below the median    D  50.2%  49.8%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile    The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  SMG Europe is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above).  SMG Europe is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.  I, John Sharkey, EVP European Operations, confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
