As an employer, we’re committed to promoting diversity and gender equality. We offer all of our people the same growth and development opportunities within a positive, open and inclusive environment.  Our approach to pay is gender neutral by design, notwithstanding our rapid expansion through acquisitions. Our analysis shows that our gender pay gap is a result of the structure of our workforce and the historic implications of company integration. In general, we have more male representation in higher paid roles following our period of acquisitions.  We know there’s work to do to close the gender pay gap. As a first step, we’re committed to developing a deeper understanding of the reasons why we have a gender pay gap, and where appropriate, defining and implementing appropriate actions to help us make positive changes. Our next step will be to focus particularly on getting more women on to Boards and into the management team.
