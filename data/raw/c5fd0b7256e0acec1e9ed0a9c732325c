At Ei Group plc we believe in equality and are confident that men and women are paid equally for equivalent work across the business and we have tested that principle to ensure it is so.  The gender pay gap is the difference in average pay and bonuses for all men and women across an organisation.  Whilst we are confident that we have equal pay for work of equal value, we recognise that there is a gender pay gap under the prescribed definition.  This is primarily driven by more male employees occupying senior roles compared to female employees and the lower representation of males in the more junior positions.  We are committed to equal opportunities and believe that we have created an entirely non-discriminatory working environment. Our recruitment policy and guidance is underpinned by our vision and values and operates to ensure that all employees are recruited, developed, promoted and remunerated on the basis of their skills and job suitability. Internal progression is something that we are proud to champion and we continue to hold the Gold accreditation by Investors in People. During 2017, and continuing in 2018, we have increased the number of internal development programmes available to our people across all of our businesses to support the development of our own talent and to provide real career development and opportunities to cross over to our new business.  We train line managers so they understand any unconscious bias and manage and challenge how this may impact recruitment and progression within the business. Where possible we will promote gender balanced shortlists for senior positions and for our future management development programmes. We will monitor progress and movement in our gender pay gap when assessing the performance of these activities.  At the highest level in the business we are mindful of the issues of diversity, including gender diversity. As at the date of capturing of the data above, 40% of our growing workforce in the wider group were female including three out of eight of the most senior managers and two out of six of the executive management group immediately below the Board level.
