The  gender  pay  gap is an  equality  measure  that  reports  the  difference  in  hourly  rate 

of pay between women  and men.  Currently  the UK gender pay gap stands at 18%, the 

lowest  level  to  date.  The  figure  provides  indication  of  men  and  women’s  relative 

earning  power and shows  gender inequalities  in the labour  market.   

Government  legislation  as  part  of  The  Equality  Act  requires  companies  of  250 

employees  or larger  to take  a ‘snapshot’  of  pay  on  5th April  2017. The  results  of  this 

snapshot  should  then  be compared by gender and published  within  12 months.   

St. John’s has a comparatively  low gender pay gap, where  mean average income per 

hour  is  5%  (men  earn  on  average  5%  more  than  women  per  hour  within  the 

organisation).  Though  this  figure  does not  provide  insight  into  underlying  causes,  as 

an  organisation  we are committed  to finding  ways  to reduce  the  gender  pay  gap and 

we will  be proactively  benchmarking  our findings  with  other  similar organisations.   

Our  low  percentage  rate  of  gender  inequality  is  partly  because  of  our  proactive 

strategies  in  place  that  seek  to  promote  gender  equality.    We have  an  Equality  and 

Diversity  forum  and policy  in place, our  staff  receive E&D training  on an  annual  basis 

and our  transparent  fixed  salary  bands are directly  linked  to job roles  and grades and 

not  based around  individuals.
