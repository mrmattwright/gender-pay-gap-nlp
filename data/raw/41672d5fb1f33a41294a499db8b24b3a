The gender pay gap is a high level snapshot of pay within an organisation and shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce.  In contrast, ‘equal pay’ is a more specific legal concept that deals with the pay differences between men and women carrying out comparable jobs. Men and women in comparable jobs are normally entitled to the same pay unless an employer can show differences in pay are justified. A gender pay gap does not equate to the existence of an equal pay problem, albeit a gender pay gap may be a trigger for further investigation about the reasons why the gap exists.  The requirements of the new regulations involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; however it does not involve publishing individual employees data. These six calculations are;   mean gender pay gap;  median gender pay gap;  mean bonus gender pay gap;  median bonus gender pay gap;  proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment;  proportion of males and females in each pay quartile*.  Average & Median Hourly Rate  Salary data used for this report is based on employee pay on the snapshot date of 31 March 2017.  South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust currently employs 4404 members of staff on permanent and fixed term contracts and a further 826 individuals on zero hours bank contracts. The gender split for our organisation is 54% males and 45% females. The details supplied in the report include all permanent, fixed term contract staff and employee employed on zero hours bank contracts.       Gender    Avg.

In addition to incentive shifts we pay an on-boarding payment to some of our Graduate Paramedics who accept positions in areas of the Trust where significant vacancies are held and these vacancies are deemed as ‘hard to fill’ due to the current national shortage of Paramedics.   As such both payment schemes are counted as bonus schemes in terms of the gender pay reporting.  Salary data used for this report is based on employee bonus pay between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017. (A negative amount shows the amount of pay for women is higher than that of their male colleagues).

We have undertaken a number of initiatives within the organisation that specifically looks to address areas whereby there may be seen to be an inequality. In particular we reviewed the recruitment process for our Operations Officer role in Cornwall as at the time we only had a small number of females in this role. We therefore progressed with a recruitment campaign where we encouraged female Paramedics within this area to apply for the role.  Following the deadline of 31 March 2018 for the release of gender pay reporting the Trust is committed to undertaking a benchmarking review of other Ambulance Trust’s, wider NHS organisations and other public and private sector organisations. This will allow us to provide a wider understanding of our data  Summary  This report has been shared and approved by the Trust’s Executive Directors on 27 March 2018. Trust strategies proposed and implemented in the future will be reviewed in line with our gender pay analysis and these will be reported by the Trust on an annual basis.
