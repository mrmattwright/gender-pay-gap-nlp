Gender pay gap reporting                      Canon Europe is the EMEA strategic headquarters of Canon Inc. based in Uxbridge, UK.  Founded in 1937 with the specific goal of making the best quality camera available to customers, Canon’s tireless passion for the Power of Image has since extended its technology into many other markets and has established it as a world leader in both consumer and business imaging solutions. Its solutions comprise products ranging from digital compact and SLR cameras, through broadcast lenses and portable X-ray machines, to multi-function and production printers, all supported by a range of value added services. Canon invests heavily in R&D to deliver the most innovative products and services to satisfy customers’ creative needs. From amateur photographers to professional print companies, Canon enables each customer to realise their own passion for image. Canon’s corporate philosophy is Kyosei – ‘living and working together for the common good’. Canon pursues sustainable business growth, focusing on reducing its own environmental impact and supporting customers to reduce theirs using Canon’s products, solutions and services. Canon has achieved global certification to ISO 14001, demonstrating a world-class environmental management standard.          Under new legislation that came into force in April 2017, UK employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish their gender pay gap.  In this report, we are sharing the median (midpoint) and mean (average) pay gaps between men and women’s hourly ordinary pay and bonuses. Under the new legislation, we have to report six different pieces of information relating to the pay of the included workforce population and these are:            Pay gap, mean and median  This is the difference in hourly pay of male and female included employees per 5th April snapshot date and this is expressed as a percentage of the hourly pay of male included employees. This means that a positive number indicates men earn more than women; a negative number will mean the reverse. Pay is reported as both ordinary pay and bonus pay.      Bonus pay gap, mean and median  This refers to the bonus commission pay paid to male and female relevant employees during the 12 months prior to the snapshot date, expressed as a percentage of the bonus commission pay paid to male relevant employees.              Bonus pay proportion  Bonus pay proportion refers to male relevant employees who received a bonus commission in the 12 months, expressed as a percentage of the male relevant employees; female relevant employees who received a bonus commission in the 12 months, expressed as a percentage of the female relevant employees.      Quartiles  Organise workforce into evenly sized quartiles based on ranking of all included employees from highest to lowest by hourly rate of pay. Report on each quartile the number of full-pay male and females in each quartile as a percentage of the total in the quartile.            It is important to remember that gender pay reporting is different to equal pay.  Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with and the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are.          Our Workforce  We collated our snapshot data on 5 April 2017 and from this, excluded non-relevant employees (those not receiving full-pay/those not employed by the us on the snap shot date). This left us with an included workforce demographics as follows: Total included employees Canon EMEA Our total included employees, 34% are women and 66% are men          Our gender pay gap statistics  The Office for National Statistics has just published (Oct 2017) the GPG for all employee jobs in the UK 2017 which shows the Median GPG to be 18.4% and the Mean GPG to be 17. 4%. Now you have a point of reference when reviewing our results. Gender pay gap – Snapshot Data The above chart shows our mean and median hourly ordinary pay gender pay gap          Pay Quartiles  The below illustrates the gender distribution of all included employees for Canon Europe across all four quartiles.          Gender Pay Gap – Bonus  The above chart shows our mean and median bonus gender pay gap.          Bonus pay proportion  Please note that interns and employees who started within the first quarter did not receive a bonus in 2017. This explains why these figures do not add up to 100%          Understanding our pay gap  Men have traditionally dominated our industry and this is reflected in our EMEA headquarters where 66% of our employees are male and 34% are female. This therefore impacts the median and mean bonus gender pay gap as these positions often attract a higher level of variable earnings, reflecting market practice. The make-up of our business – with more men at senior levels – means our average male salary is higher than our average female salary. Overall, the gender pay gap is most significantly impacted by the fact that we have a comparatively lower proportion of female employees in management and expert roles and in leadership and executive positions.                    Closing the gap  Our ambition is to close the gap. To achieve this we are committed to delivering current and new initiatives to improve how we attract, engage and develop female talent. We have an inclusive culture and offer progressive and enhanced maternity, adoption and shared parental leave policies to balance the demand of parenting between both parents. We have Flexible Working and Family Friendly policies and we aim to help employees successfully combine having a family whilst pursuing a career within Canon. As part of improving a work-life balance, we are introducing a well-being programme with an increased focus on helping employees balance work pressures and family life. We have introduced a Diversity in the Workplace.Gender focus group to work on initiatives that will enable and attract female employees into management and leadership positions. Attracting and hiring women into our business is important to us, especially in sales and service roles that are currently less represented by women. We strive to do this through inclusive bias-free attraction and recruitment practices. A renewed approach is needed to attract the right talent to our business and promote the opportunities for women within Canon Europe. We aim to highlight existing female role models within the business to enable more women to progress to senior management levels through mentoring, coaching and leadership and talent development programmes. Planned workshops will be scheduled to create better awareness of diversity within the workplace and its associated benefits. We believe by valuing the diversity and harnessing the unique ideas, opinions and talents of those who work for and with us, we can enhance the organisation, our performance, our brand and our ability to achieve our goals.
