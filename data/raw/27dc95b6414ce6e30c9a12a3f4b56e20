They are still wholly committed to the business with two generations actively involved day to day. This engenders a community culture which rewards hard work, teamwork and a commitment to customer service that can be lost in larger corporate structures.  Smiths are committed to ensuring our customers are delighted with our work, impressed by our people and certain to use Smiths again.  “Many of our people have been with the company for a long time. It is their experience and knowledge which allows us to meet our customers’ needs. Practical experience comes from doing the work. Each completed project or finished job further improves our knowledge, experience and expertise of the industry.”  The full History of Smiths can be found here: History of Smiths  Smiths Now  After 35 years of operations and having built one of Gloucestershire’s largest businesses, Alan Smith and his team continue to innovate, develop and plan for the future.
