Gender Pay Gap 
Report 2017

INTRODUCTION

Since acquiring its first North 
Sea interests in 2007, TAQA 
has created a business which 
is now ranked among the top 
exploration and production 
companies in the UK. TAQA 
operates five offshore oil and 
gas platforms and it also owns 
equity in fields which are 
operated by others.

We recognise the value a balanced 
workforce brings to our company’s 
success and remain fully committed 
to continually improving this, alongside 
wider industry efforts.

Gender pay gap legislation is a government 
initiative to ensure everyone is given a 
fair opportunity to succeed, regardless 
of their gender. In accordance with UK 
government regulation and as an employer 
of more than 250 staff in the UK, we have 
published our annual gender pay gap for 
the period 5 April, 2017.

It’s important to recognise that gender 
pay gap is not the same as equal pay, 
although this could be one of the reasons 
for a gender pay gap. TAQA does not have 
an equal pay issue. TAQA’s approach to 
compensation and benefits is gender neutral 
by design. We use a market leading tool for 
job evaluation where each job description is 
scored and placed in our grading structure. 
We continually monitor pay levels for all 
employees using a fair and consistent 
process based on market data and an 
individual’s experience and performance.

Results show that TAQA has a gender 
pay gap, driven by a significantly higher 
proportion of men than women in our 
workforce, particularly in the offshore 
population which attracts offshore 
allowances included in the calculations. 
Historically in the UK, primarily as a result 
of societal and cultural influences, offshore 
personnel and engineering-based roles have 
been male dominated and that continues 
to be the case. Our gap is therefore a 
reflection of the industry and candidates 
available to TAQA, rather than pointing to an 
underlying equality issue.

gender pay gap. This is not something that will 
happen overnight and it will take a huge effort 
from everyone to ensure we do everything 
within our means to address the gap.

TAQA will continue to take steps to address 
its gender pay gap over time. For example, 
36% of employees hired into our engineering 
team over the last five years were female. 
Additionally, through our Corporate Social 
Responsibility portfolio we are involved in 
a wide range of initiatives to educate and 
engage school children about our business and 
promote STEM subjects. In 2017 alone, we 
reached over 800 local primary and secondary 
pupils with STEM messages across 50 schools.

This report explains further about what the 
gender pay gap is, TAQA’s results and what  
we are currently doing and plan to do to with 
the aim of addressing the gender pay gap in 
our business.

Declaration: 
We confirm the information and data 
reported is accurate as of the snapshot date 
of 5 April 2017.

society across the UK is to eliminate any

TAQA GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?

the aim is to break 
down the barriers 
that stop 
women achieving.

The government introduced 
the gender pay gap legislation 
as an initiative to ensure 
everyone is given a fair 
opportunity to succeed, 
regardless of their gender.

Reasons why a gap may exist in some 
organisations include:

•  Pay discrimination – men being paid 

higher than women doing the same job;

•  Caring responsibilities – more women 
are involved in caring responsibilities;

From the opportunities women are 
given in school, to the ability to move 
up the executive pipeline, the aim is 
to break down the barriers that stop 
women achieving.

Gender pay gap is not the same as 
equal pay, although this could be one of 
the reasons for the gap. An organisation 
could have no pay discrimination but still 
have a gender pay gap and vice versa.

•  Occupational segregation - women 
clustered in different industries and 
in less senior roles;

•  Career expectations – women 

traditionally don’t have high 
expectations of progressing to 
higher levels of the organisation;

•  High proportion of women working 

in lower paid professions.

TAQA’S RESULTS

The method for calculating gender pay gap statistics has been 
outlined in detail by the UK government and the results from 
every organisation are published on a UK government website.

Using the snapshot data, the UK government gender pay gap 
regulations have four key reporting requirements. These are 
shown below, along with TAQA’s results:

1.

2.

The differences in mean and median 
average hourly rate pay between 
men and women;

The differences in mean and median 
bonus pay between men and women;

+30.2% Mean Gap (average)
+30.5% Median Gap (mid point)

+23.9% Mean Gap (average)
-5.8% Median Gap (mid point)

3.

The proportion of men and women 
receiving bonus pay in a year;

83% Male     92% Female

4.

The distribution of men and women between pay band quartiles, 
calculated using the range of average hourly pay rates.

TAQA GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017UNDERSTANDING OUR GENDER PAY GAP

As a comparison, we calculated the 
mean difference in gender pay minus 
all offshore allowances to compare 
base salary and allowances common to 
both onshore and offshore employees. 
This reduced the gap considerably:

+13.4% Mean Gap 
hourly pay (average)
+6.8% Median Gap 
hourly pay (mid point)

Our results show that the 
main reason for our gender 
pay gap is driven by:

•  A significantly higher proportion of 
men than women in our workforce, 
particularly in the offshore population 
which attracts offshore allowances that 
are included in the calculations; more 
than 50% of TAQA’s employees work 
offshore, with 98% of them being male.

•  A higher number of men in senior 

professional engineering-based and 
management roles, primarily because 
of historical societal and cultural 
influences which have resulted in these 
roles traditionally attracting more males.

Our gap is therefore a reflection of 
the industry and candidates available 
to TAQA, rather than pointing to an 
underlying equality issue.

FACTS:

According to a Women in Engineering 
report in Jan 2016 - men and women 
receive completely different careers 
advice at school.

According to a 2014 survey of 2000 young 
professionals by City & Guilds, the top 
three career choices recommended to girls 
are nursing & care, teaching and medical. 
For boys it is IT, engineering and finance.

There is more that companies can do, 
and while we don’t have an equal pay 
issue, TAQA will continue to take steps 
to address its gender pay gap over time.

We have had some success within our 
engineering team, with 36% of employees 
hired over the last five years being female.

TAQA does not have an equal pay issue. 
Equal pay for equal work is part of the 
Equality Act 2010 and is to ensure that 
a male and female doing the same job 
receive the same level of pay. TAQA’s 
approach to compensation and benefits 
is gender neutral by design. We use a 
market leading tool for job evaluation 
where each job description is scored 
and placed in our grading structure. 
We continually monitor pay levels for 
all employees using a fair and consistent 
process based on market data and an 
individual’s experience and performance.

TAQA GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017REDUCING OUR GAP

The challenge in every 
organisation and society 
across the UK is to eliminate 
any gender pay gap.

This is not something that will happen 
overnight and it will take a huge effort 
from everyone, not just employers, 
to address the gap.

In order to address our gap, TAQA 
is focussed on a wide-range of 
initiatives, including: 

Corporate Social 
Responsibility- Education
We have a wide range of initiatives to 
educate and engage school children about 
our business and promote STEM subjects. 
In 2017 alone we reached over 800 
local primary and secondary pupils with 
STEM messages across 50 schools; over 
30 TAQA volunteers participated at CSR 
events; and industry promotion took place 
at 11 community and industry events.

Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) 
Offshore Achievement Awards
TAQA is a key supporter of the SPE 
Offshore Achievement Awards (OAAs), 
which annually celebrate company 
successes and individual accomplishments. 
The Society of Petroleum Engineer's work 
in nurturing young people's interest in 
STEM subjects is key to why we continue 
to support the OAAs.

Aberdeen Science Centre
Annual maintenance of the TAQA 
sponsored planetarium, including purchase 
of a new film, and sponsorship of the 
Centre’s Engineering Club.

Maritime Museum
Maintenance of the equipment for the 3D 
film of TAQA’s Tern platform, which is part 
of the oil and gas exhibition.

Greenpower - inspiring engineers
A national engineering competition 
which challenges school pupils to design, 
construct and race electric cars. TAQA 
sponsors the Grampian Heat and in 2017 
approximately 40 schools participated.

NASA in Aberdeen - inspiring the  
next generation 
Funding for a NASA Astronaut and Robotics 
Engineer to visit Aberdeen and deliver a 
STEM based programme to schools and the 
public across the North-East of Scotland. 

Young Engineers & Science Clubs
TAQA funds the purchase of materials 
for several local schools to build cars and 
participate in the Greenpower Challenge.

Northsound Schools Energy Quiz
In association with the Energy Institute, 
the quiz provides school pupils from 
across Aberdeen City and Shire with the 
opportunity to showcase their general 
knowledge and gain an insight into the 
oil and gas industry. TAQA sponsors two 
of the heats.

Energy Institute Schools 
Outreach Programme
TAQA provides funding to support the 
schools outreach activities encouraging 
STEM subjects.

capability and behavioural needs. 
Succession is a key component of 
workforce planning, providing for 
development of the organisation as well 
as personal development for individuals.

Parental Transition Scheme
Returning to the business after taking 
extended leave can be daunting for 
some. We will be introducing this 
scheme to support employees return 
to the workplace and ensure continued 
commitment and engagement to benefit 
the business, whilst minimising the impact 
of time out of the office on their delivery 
and career aspirations.

Recruitment
Refresh Recruitment Processes
Utilise the specialist market and discipline 
knowledge of our resourcing providers, 
with the aim of attracting a diverse pool 
of candidates.
When an opportunity arises, e.g. when 
we have to backfill, create or redesign 
any role, a review will be undertaken to 
determine suitability for flexible  
working patterns.
Refresh training and management 
development programmes to include 
unconscious bias training.

Work Across the Industry
Continue to participate in an industry 
working group to establish what we can 
do together to implement initiatives which 
promote oil and gas roles to both males 
and females.
