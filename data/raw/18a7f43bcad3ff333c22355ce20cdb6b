What is the Gender  
Pay Gap Report?

UK companies with more than 250 employees are 
required to report on their Gender Pay Gap. This is  
the difference between the average earnings of all the 
male and female employees within the organisation.

This report sets out our Gender Pay Gap  
position and what we’re doing about it.

THE NUMBERS

51.8% female

All figures calculated at 1st April 2017

The charts below show the gender  
split when we order hourly rate of pay 
from highest to lowest and group into 
four equal quartiles:
Female %  Male %

55.6

44.4

Q1 Lower

50.6

49.4

Q3 Upper middle

55.9

44.1

Q2 Lower middle

45.2

54.8

Q4 Upper

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? 
Our mean gender pay gap is 11.1% and  
the median is 6.4%

The number of females within Quartile 1  
and Quartile 2 is higher than males.

Quartile 3 is more evenly split; however at our  
most senior levels (Quartile 4) we have more  
males than females.

We have 254 employees who work part time,  
and 75% of all part time roles are filled by females.   
We believe these roles are attractive to applicants  
as they provide, in part, greater flexibility.

The majority of our Team Manager positions (which 
typically fall into Quartile 2) are occupied by females.

Our bonus pay gap is favourable to women.  
The high median figure of -256% is attributed to  
the bonus structure operated within our print works, 
which currently operates with a predominantly male 
workforce. Should this figure be removed, the median 
bonus gap would be -7%.

So what are we going to do about it….

CLOSING THE GAP

Archant over the last 5 years has committed  
more resource and investment to learning  
and development.

Over the past 3 years, the vast majority of our 
workforce has attended intensive digital training, 
providing the necessary knowledge and know-how  
to succeed in today’s fast moving digital world.

In addition, managers and future talent have  
attended our Management and Leadership Academy, 
equipping them with the skills to grow. 

To encourage all levels of employees, both male and 
female, to develop their careers with Archant it is our 
policy to advertise vacancies internally, and going 
forwards we will do all we can to ensure we have 
gender balanced shortlists and provide the  
best support to women who wish to progress  
to more senior roles. 

We will continue to promote our family friendly  
policy and embrace as wide a range of work  
place flexibility as is possible. 

The principles of our remuneration policy which 
determines how we review our pay and award 
increases, sets out that for all employees in similar  
roles our approach is to ensure there is fair pay.   

We have appointed the Chairman of our  
remuneration committee, a main board member, 
to have responsibility for gender diversity. At the 
beginning of 2018 the number of women on  
the Executive team increased. 

As Chief HR & Development Officer, I, Dee Willmott, can 
confirm that the information contained herein is accurate.
