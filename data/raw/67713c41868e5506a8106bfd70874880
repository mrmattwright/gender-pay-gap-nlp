Jesus College – Gender Pay Gap 

Written Statement  

Data collected by Jesus College on 31 March 2017 shows that the College had a workforce of 136 
women and 132 men, with a mean gender pay gap of 19.1% and a median gender pay gap of 
22.8%.   

The principal reason for the gap is the large number of women working in part-time roles at lower 
pay rates, particularly in the Housekeeping Department, which employs a fifth of the College’s 
overall workforce. If the College were able to eliminate the pay gap in Housekeeping, then the 
result would be a mean gender pay gap of 4.8% and a median gender pay gap of -4.6%.  

Bonus payments for staff only make up a small proportion of pay (2 - 3%). College Fellows (mostly 
academics) do not receive a bonus payment. 
 
Many of the College’s Fellows are employed by the University, which has also reported on its 
gender pay gap: http://www.inclusivecambridge.admin.cam.ac.uk/gender-equality-reporting. 
 
Jesus College is fully committed to equality of opportunity and fairness, and we work hard to 
ensure that our employment policies and practices are fair, equitable and consistent. The College 
has  generous  family  friendly  policies,  fair  and  transparent  pay  and  reward  structures,  and  a 
positive equality, dignity and respect at work culture. We will use this gender pay gap study, and 
continued staff feedback, to further build on these areas. 

 

 

Declaration
