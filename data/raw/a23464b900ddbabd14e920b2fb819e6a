What is the Gender Pay Gap?  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s mean and median earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is represented as a percentage, where a positive number is a pay gap in favour of men, and a negative number is a pay gap in favour of women.  The Report  Our Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 is based on data from March 2017, made up of 6817 employees of which 3783 (55.5%) were Female, and 3034 (44.5%) were Male. It primarily measures the differences in hourly mean and median earnings and in bonus pay. In keeping with the statutory data requirements, the report covers:   The Mean Hourly Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Median Hourly Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Mean Bonus Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Median Bonus Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The proportion (%) of women and men who received Bonus Pay  The proportion (%) of women and men on 4 equal population quartiles.   We have created a short animation to help explain what the Gender Pay Gap is and how it is calculated:     ‌ The Gender Pay Gap video text is also available for download.    Detailed definitions and information on the data used are available in the Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 .  Results       Hourly Pay Gap     The University of Liverpool mean and median hourly pay gap percentages are presented below. All employees on full pay at the time of data collection were included in the analysis.  The Mean Pay Gap is 24.57% vs 17.4% UK National (Office for National Statistics - April 2017)  The Median Pay Gap is 19.00% vs 18.4% UK National (Office for National Statistics - April 2017)  ‌     Bonus Pay Gap     Three categories of bonus pay were included in this analysis, 1) Contractual, 2) Exceptional Performance Award (EPA), and 3) Clinical Excellence Award (CEA).   The Mean Bonus Pay Gap is 76.16%.  The Median Bonus Pay Gap is 89.95%.  1.27% of female staff received a bonus.  2.01% of male staff received a bonus.   The overall proportion of bonuses received by employees was:  Men: 55% and Women: 45%  ‌     Proportion of Men and Women in Lower to Upper Quartile Pay Bands     The staff population was divided into four population pay quartiles. The diagram below is a representation of the number of men, and number of women who where in each quartile.   71.6% of staff in the lower pay quartile are women, compared to 38.2% of staff in the Upper (higher paid) quartile.     Initiatives Helping to Address Our Gender Pay Gap  Here are some examples of action we have taken and continue to take to address the Gender Pay Gap through promoting gender equality and increasing family friendly support as well as female focused training, development, more transparent promotion processes and networking opportunities.  Promoting Gender Equality  In 2009 the University joined the Athena SWAN Charter and has been actively addressing gender equality for staff and students. We were awarded Athena SWAN Silver status in 2016 and currently 10 Schools and Institutes hold their own awards. Watch a video on Athena SWAN at the University.  Family Friendly Support   Positive policies have been introduced around shared parental leave, surrogacy and paid fertility treatment leave  Two on-campus car parks have been made available to carers  Parents’ and carers’ networks have been launched, providing staff with the opportunity to share experiences and raise concerns   ‌Find out more about our Family Friendly initiatives .  Transparent Promotion Processes  In response to evidence suggesting reticence on the part of women to apply for promotion, we have introduced intitiatives such as:   Ensuring that promotion panel members are representative of the academic workforce  Unconscious Bias training for panel members  Promotion workshops, led by recently promoted staff and panel members – with some sessions ring-fenced for women  Developing online resources including case studies linked to career paths, drawn from across the protected characteristics, sharing tips   Currently 24.6% of Professors are women, an increase from 18% in 2012. University staff can access case studies linked to career paths and information on promotion, annual review and role profiles here. The University salary scales information can be found here .  Training, Development and Networking  In 2013 we launched a Female Early Career Researcher Network (FECRN) and in 2014, the Liverpool Women in Science and Engineering Society (LivWiSE) was introduced. These networks endeavour to help support the career development, and the celebrate the successes of female researchers.  Further to this, the University has invested in the professional development of female employees through the Aurora Leadership Programme and the Springboard Careers Programme . Additional in-house Leadership & Management programmes support these measures along with a Mentoring Network .  Join the conversation  We would like to invite all staff to join the discussion about the causes and solutions to the gender pay gap:   What questions does this data raise?  What further analysis would help us understand the causes of the GPG?  What can we do to improve current initiatives/policies to close the GPG?  What potential new activity could be introduced that would contribute to reducing the GPG?   Please send any comments to equality@liv.ac.uk or post to Diversity & Equality, Hart Building. You can also join the conversation on Twitter @LivUniEquality       Find out more:   Detailed information on all initiatives taken by the University is available in the Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 .
