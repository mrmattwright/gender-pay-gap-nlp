workforce and we will launch our new Equality and Diversity Strategy in the 
coming months following a review of our Gender Pay figures.   
 
Of the companies working together as Eden Futures, Eden Care & Support 
Group Ltd is the largest and therefore the only company where we are 
required to report externally our Gender Pay figures.  This is based on the 
number of staff employed by that company on the snapshot date of 5th April 
2017. 
 
The figures below have been reported in line with the Equality Act 2010 
however do not reflect Eden Futures as a whole.  This report will be updated 
comprehensively with the results for the whole organisation by the end of 
May 2018.
