A wider set of experiences and perspectives will increase our ability to meet our global clients’ needs; so we are increasing diversity throughout our business by embedding this into mindsets as well as processes.  Our regional diversity roadmaps are informed by a global set of principles that address inclusive leadership and progression, recruiting for diversity and creating an environment where all our people can succeed.  In North America, for example, we rolled out our mandatory diversity and inclusion e-learning module and achieved 99 percent completion. We also raised diversity awareness globally by marking key events, such as International Women's Day to address the challenges around gender equality.  We are setting strong targets to improve the diversity of our workforce and our next step is a review of our recruitment standards and management development programmes to embed inclusive leadership.
