Conduent 2018  
UK Gender Pay Gap Report

As a services-based company with a presence 
in more than 35 locations across the globe, the 
diversity of our global workforce is our greatest 
competitive advantage. 

We consider it a business imperative to build, celebrate, and nurture a corporate culture that is inclusive and 
provides equal opportunities to all. This is reflected in our commitment to being an open and collaborative 
workplace. At Conduent, every employee should feel empowered to share their perspectives, ideas, and 
knowledge in an open and authentic manner. This in turn, fosters new innovations and solutions that help us 
deliver best-in-class experiences to our clients’ and those that they serve.

We take a top-down, bottom-up approach to Diversity & Inclusion (D&I). Our CEO Ashok Vemuri has joined 
the world’s leading companies, many of which are our clients, in the “CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion” 
- a unique collaboration of more than 150 CEOs who have pledged to advance diversity and inclusion in the 
workplace. While our commitment to D&I starts at the top, we also create numerous opportunities for our 
employees to get involved and drive a diverse and inclusive culture. 

Consistent with our commitment to a fair and inclusive workplace, our approach to employee pay is gender 
neutral. Our compensation strategy is designed to ensure employee pay is both internally equitable and 
aligned with individual performance. The following data shows pay broken down by gender in our three largest 
UK sub-businesses, as of April 5, 2017.

addressing any pay inequity and are regularly 
evaluating and taking proactive steps to do so.
