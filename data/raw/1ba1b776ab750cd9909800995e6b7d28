GENDER PAY GAP REPORT FOR WATSON FARLEY & WILLIAMS LLP  

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

As an employer we are committed to diversity in all its 
forms and at all levels of the firm. We pride ourselves 
on recognising the benefit of an inclusive environment, 
welcoming different working styles into the firm’s culture 
and embedding the idea that performance is best 
judged on ability alone. As a firm, Watson Farley & 
Williams (“WFW”) endeavours to create an inclusive 
workplace that attracts and retains the most talented 
people from all backgrounds and cultures, ensuring that 
opportunities to develop and progress are available 
from the first day of employment.  

While the data in this report is based on our London entities, we are driving equality, 
diversity and inclusion across all of our offices and our Diversity & Inclusion initiative 
applies globally. As such, we are pleased to welcome the introduction of gender pay 
gap reporting to aid transparency and remind us that it is imperative to focus on our 
efforts to align gender pay. 

The legal reporting requirements regarding the gender pay gap only cover the firm's 
largest UK entity, Watson Farley & Williams LLP. This entity employs all London 
based associates, paralegals and trainees together with business services employees 
who support the London office. Also referenced within this report is WFW Global LLP 
which engages the firm's business services employees who are based in London, but 
provide support to our offices on a global basis. This includes the Finance, 
Compliance, Communications, Business Development and Information Technology 
teams. This entity also employs the firm's directors and management team.  

The firm’s gender pay gap calculations are based on “ordinary pay” which includes: 
basic pay, allowances and pay for leave but excludes: overtime pay, repayment of 
expenses and interest free loans. Our key findings are outlined below.

WFW Global LLP 
 
As at 5 April 2017, WFW Global LLP had 83 employees within the London office and 
therefore does not fulfil the reporting requirement of having more than 250 
employees. However, only reporting on the data of Watson Farley & Williams LLP 
would be misleading, as nearly 25% of our employees in London are employed by 
WFW Global LLP. Below is the comparable gender pay gap data:

Understanding our gender pay gap results 
 
While we are required to report the gender pay gap results of Watson Farley & 
Williams LLP separately, if we were to aggregate the results from Watson Farley & 
Williams LLP and WFW Global LLP they would show a mean gender pay gap of 
17.1% 

Within Watson Farley & Williams LLP our mean gender pay gap is 4.8% higher than 
the national average, which indicates men earn 18.1% more than women. However, 
within WFW Global LLP our mean gender pay gap is only 1% which is significantly 
better than the national average. 

Our data from our upper middle and upper quartiles (from both entities) shows that 
we pay men and women equally for equivalent roles across our firm. As is common 
in the legal sector, the roles that sit within our lower quartiles (in both entities) and 
our lower middle quartile in Watson Farley & Williams LLP are secretarial, 
administrative and more junior-level business services roles, which are 
predominately held by women. While we are confident that we pay men and women 
within these lower quartiles equally for equivalent roles and these roles are rewarded 
in line with the market, they do have an impact on the pay gap within our lower 
quartile bands and in turn, our gender pay gap overall.

The proportion of men and women awarded a bonus is broadly balanced; however, 
our mean bonus pay gap of 38.2% in Watson Farley & Williams LLP is also the result 
of secretarial/entry level roles and the fact that there are a higher number of part 
time roles held by women. 

Moving Forward 
 
As a firm we are committed to reducing our gender pay gap and are working with 
our employees and key internal stakeholders to identify practical ways of doing this. 
For example, we have introduced an agile working policy across all offices which has 
been well received. We also offer a generous maternity/shared parental leave 
package and offer support, greater flexibility and coaching to those returning from 
an extended period of leave. More recently, we have incorporated diversity and 
inclusion activities into our reward structure in the hope of achieving greater gender 
equality and employees at all levels are required to undertake unconscious bias 
training. 

We are also committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment 
for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil 
partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or 
disability. We have a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or 
equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). As 
such, WFW: 

 

 

 

carries out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals; 

evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure; 
and 

conducts an internal equal pay audit each year in conjunction with the 
firm’s annual salary review process.  

We trust that in future years, our continuing efforts will help to improve gender 
balance. 

We confirm the data in this report to be accurate and has been calculated according 
to the legal requirements.
