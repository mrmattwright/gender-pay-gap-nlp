Situated between the Solent and the New Forest National Park, we are in the ideal location for growing the earliest, sweetest strawberries and blueberries to be found in the UK.    NFFC was formed in 2008 by Sandy Booth and John Boyd to develop a family business originally established in 1911.  Sandy and John are both proud of their Scottish ancestry and adopted their respective tartans as the new business logo.  From the outset Sandy and John were very clear about their objectives for the business: Professional, responsible, progressive and pride.    This website is a small window into our business, we hope that whether you are considering coming to work with us, wish to visit a modern fruit farm in a wonderful area or are just curious about how and where your punnet of strawberries was grown, you will find something of interest.
