The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, who could be doing very different roles and is not the same as equal pay, which looks at pay rates for men and women who do the same role or roles of equivalent value.  This report covers both Proactive Personnel West Midlands Ltd and Proactive Personnel Ltd but we have uploaded separate data for each company on the Government Gender Pay Gap reporting website.  Proactive Personnel West Midlands Ltd has branches in Cannock, Derby, Walsall and Wolverhampton.  Proactive Personnel Ltd has branches in Chester, Liverpool, Manchester, Shrewsbury, Telford, Warrington and Wrexham.  As a recruitment business we are required to report data which includes the temporary staff we place with other employers as well as our own staff. The pay and bonus arrangements for the staff placed with external employers are outside our control as they are set by those individual employers.  Looking at Proactive Personnel West Midlands 8.73% of the staff included in the report were in-house staff working for Proactive and the remaining 91.27% were temporary staff placed with external employers. The split between men and women was 83.14% male and 16.86% female.  The figures for Proactive Personnel Ltd show that 9.21% were in-house staff working for Proactive and 90.79% were temporary staff placed with external employers. The split between men and women was 82.89% male and 17.11% female.    Pay and bonus gap Proactive Personnel West Midlands Ltd          Men    Women      Upper    86.7%    13.3%      Upper Middle    85.5%    14.5%      Lower Middle    78.3%    21.7%      Lower    81.9%    18.1%          Pay and bonus gap Proactive Personnel Ltd      Women’s    Mean    Median      Hourly Rate is    2.1% higher than men’s    1.8% higher than men’s      Bonus pay is    34.4% higher than men’s    13% lower than men’s        The proportion of staff paid a bonus were 44.7% for men and 21.3% for women    Pay Quartiles          Men    Women      Upper    82.6%    17.4%      Upper Middle    81%    19%      Lower Middle    80.2%    19.8%      Lower    87.9%    12.1%        Summary  The figures are heavily affected by the high percentage of temporary workers we place with external employers.  Each of our branches works with a different mix of employers and if we start supplying a large number of temporary staff to a new employer who pays particularly high or low rates this has a significant impact on the overall figures.  The high proportion of male staff shown is largely influenced by the fact that we specialise in sectors such as Engineering and HGV driving which tend to be male-dominated.  These sectors are also more likely to pay bonuses than for example our commercial sector where the majority of positions are office/administration based roles and tend to be more female dominated- this helps to explain the discrepancy in the percentages of men and women who receive bonuses. We are confident that there are no equal pay issues and that our pay and bonus structures are clear, fair and understood by all staff.  Within the in-house staff group working for Proactive, bonuses and higher wage rates are paid to male and female recruitment consultants. The makeup of the head office teams which include lower paid administration/accounts roles with no bonus payments and is predominantly female and this contributes to the difference in percentages of men and women who receive a bonus payment.  Within the in-house staff group, we are working hard to increase the percentage of women in management roles and both of the last two appointments at this level were female.  As a company we pride ourselves on training, developing and retaining our staff. Promoting from within is our ethos and the majority of our in-house senior staff began their career with Proactive as junior members of staff and have been trained and developed to progress into management roles within the company.  I can confirm that the data reported is accurate.

Looking For Local Driving Jobs In The North West? - 2nd October 2017  Are you searching for the best local driving jobs?  It’s estimated that the UK needs an extra 150,000 lorry drivers by 2020, so if you’re looking for local driving jobs, your services are likely to be in-demand. This is partly because the average age of a lorry driver is currently 53 which means that a whole generation will be retiring in the next few years.  Economic growth also means that there is more demand for drivers which currently isn’t being met, including in the North-West.  If you’re looking for a recession-proof job, driving is definitely a wise career choice: products will always need delivering, and drivers will always be required to get them from A to B. Those working in logistics can also earn highly competitive salaries. Unlike other careers, this isn’t a case of ‘no experience, no job’- all you need to do is gain that driving qualification and away you go.  At Proactive Personnel we always have many exciting local driving jobs in the North West , with our latest vacancies including Class 1 and Class 2 HGV Driver, Van Driver, HGV Tanker Driver, and Forklift Truck Driver.  Why not view our latest driving jobs today?

Another poll of over 600 industry professionals published in The Engineer, says 67% of UK manufacturers are worried about the future availability of staff. Another 83% said they thought there aren’t enough young people working in manufacturing and engineering.  This means that there are highly competitive salaries for those entering the profession.
