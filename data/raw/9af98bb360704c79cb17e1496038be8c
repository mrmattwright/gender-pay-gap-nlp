WILLIAM GRANT & SONS: 

UK GENDER PAY GAP

(AS AT APRIL 2017)

UK GENDER PAY GAP: OVERVIEW

New laws require UK companies with over 250 staff to report their gender pay gap by April 2018.

WHAT IS THE GENDER  
PAY GAP?

WE BELIEVE IN EQUAL PAY 
FOR THE SAME ROLE

We are confident that men and 
women in our business are paid fairly. 
We have detailed guidance setting 
out our approach to remuneration 
globally and a process to ensure that 
pay decisions are fair.

There is often confusion that gender 
pay and equal pay mean the same 
thing. This is untrue.

A gender pay gap captures the 
difference between the average 
earnings of men and women across 
a business on a broader level, 
irrespective of their role or seniority.  

There is a difference between 
equal pay and the gender pay 
gap.

Equal pay reflects men and women 
doing the same or a similar role and 
being paid equally.

HOW DOES IT APPLY TO OUR BUSINESS?

Within the William Grant 
& Sons group, we have 
a number of different 
employing entities. William 
Grant & Sons Distillers 
Limited is the only entity 
with more than 250 
employees and, therefore, 
the only company that we 
are required to report on. 
The majority of employees 
within William Grant & 

Sons Distillers work within 
our operational sites in 
Scotland (e.g. distilleries 
and manufacturing).  
 
That said, we believe it is 
important to go beyond our 
minimum legal obligations. 
We have therefore extended 
our analysis across the 
entire UK employee 
population to be as 

transparent as possible. We 
have already communicated 
internally on our gender pay 
gap (in December 2017).   
 
The infographics on the 
following pages show our 
figures for William Grant & 
Sons Distillers Limited and 
also for all William Grant & 
Sons employees in the UK.

WILLIAM GRANT & SONS DISTILLERS LIMITED: THE FIGURES

GENDER PAY GAP: THE FIGURES

At 10.5%, our median hourly pay  
gap is significantly lower than the 
national gender pay gap which is 
18.4%* (at the time of publication).  
 
These calculations are based on basic 
salary, bonus payments and allowances 

AZ DEFINITION

(e.g. car and shift) paid at a 
snapshot date, April 2017. It does 
not include overtime, expenses or 
benefits in kind.

*Office for National Statistics – October 2017

The law requires us to use the terms “mean” and “median”. In simple terms, 
mean is the average and median is the mid-point of a set of numbers.

*At WG&S all employees have the opportunity to receive a bonus. The reason why the proportion of employees receiving bonus is less than 100% relates 
to the date employees start with the business. Our performance year runs from 1 January to 31 December and employees must be employed by 1 October 
of the relevant performance year to receive a bonus payment (which is typically paid in the following March). Further, if an employee leaves/is under notice 
when the bonus would be payable, they won’t be eligible for bonus.

**The legislation requires us to identify the percentage of males and females in each pay quartile band. This is established by ranking the hourly pay rates 
from the lowest to the highest, dividing them into 4 equal groups (referred to as quartiles) and then identifying the proportion of males and females in each 
of the quartiles.

WILLIAM GRANT & SONS: UK GENDER PAY GAP

WHY DO WE HAVE A GENDER PAY GAP?

While our gender pay gap is better than the national average, it is clear that there is still work to be done to reduce it. 
Our research has revealed that our gender pay gap is driven primarily by two main factors.

The lower representation of 
women within senior levels of 
the business.
 
Traditionally, our sector has 
attracted more men than women 
overall. While particular business 
areas within William Grant & Sons 
are more gender balanced, there is 
room for improvement. 

The impact of shift working 
and specific technical roles 
within our operational 
business (e.g. our distilleries 
and manufacturing employees 
in Scotland). 

reflect additional/shift working.
●   Within our lower grade roles, 

there are a number of technical 
roles that are currently being 
done by men. These attract a 
higher base salary than other 
roles at this level.

●   Shift allowances paid suggest 

●   Having looked at this, we do 

that more men are working 
more shifts and therefore 
receiving additional pay to 

not believe there is an inequality 
in shift opportunity or the 
recruitment of technical roles.

HOW ARE WE GOING TO IMPROVE OUR GENDER PAY GAP?

As a family owned business we 
believe in doing things the right 
way and for the long term. It 
is because of this commitment 
that we have gone beyond legal 
requirements to show complete 
transparency. We have taken the 
decision to publish figures for 
William Grant & Sons employees in 

the UK, not just those entities with 
more than 250 employees.

We are making strides forward to 
improve not just our gender pay 
gap but our wider diversity and 
inclusion agenda. One of the things 
we’re starting with is by listening 
to our workforce. We have recently 

launched a Diversity and Inclusion 
steering group made up of global 
representatives to lead our diversity 
and inclusion agenda. This will 
allow us to listen and increase our 
understanding of diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace. These 
learnings will be crucial in informing 
our strategy going forward.

“At William Grant & Sons, we need to ensure we 
have a workforce full of diverse perspectives and 
unique insights where differences and views are 
respected and where all employees are 
encouraged to create their own personal legacy.”
