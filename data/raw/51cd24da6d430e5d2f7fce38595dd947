The University of Stirling places gender equality in relation to retention, continuation and success of staff at the heart of our Equality Outcomes and Strategic Plan to 2021.  From 2017, any organisation with 250 or more employees must publish and support specific figures about their gender pay gap. Here the University will publish our annual data and a contextual narrative to explain the information and actions being taken to address the findings.  I confirm that this data is accurate and has been scrutinised by the University leadership team.
