Care Gender Pay Gap 
Report 2017

Commitment 
to fairness 

At Four Seasons Health Care, in providing a home for 
over 15,000 older and vulnerable people, we know 
that what we do is important. Our focus is to provide 
high standards of care and to give our residents the 
best possible experience every day. Achieving this and 
delivering customer satisfaction depends on having 
colleagues who are well-trained, motivated, happy in 
their jobs and find their work rewarding. 

We are committed to equality in employment, 
recognition and reward. Our pay structure 
is gender neutral, so that people doing 
equivalent jobs are paid at equivalent rates. 
We encourage diversity in our workforce, 
which mirrors the communities we serve and 
we are constantly evaluating our systems and 
processes to ensure that our workplace is free 
from any form of bias. We aim to provide all 
of our colleagues with equal opportunities 
for personal and career development. 
For instance, we have our apprenticeship 
scheme, our Care Home Assistant Practitioner 
programme, our preceptorship programme for 
new graduate nurses and our nurse academy, 
mentioned later in this report. 

Our annual engagement survey, conducted 
in September 2017, received responses 
from nearly 12,000 colleagues representing 
84% of our workforce. The findings were 
encouraging as over 90% of respondents 
thought that care of people in our homes 
was a priority and were happy to go the extra 
mile; around 90% found their job rewarding 
and were happy in their work; 83% believed 
that all colleagues were treated fairly and 81% 
said they were encouraged to develop. 

line customer satisfaction ratings. These are 
based upon feedback from residents, their 
relatives and visiting care professionals and 
average 97-98% across our care homes. 

We are encouraged by these outcomes and 
will continue to focus on promoting equal 
opportunity and reward with zero tolerance 
for any form of discrimination. We have 
recorded a gender pay gap, albeit one which 
is below the national average, which is mainly 
for reasons associated with the profile of 
our workforce. We have significantly more 
women than men in our workforce across 
all pay levels from front-line carers in our 
homes to senior management. Amongst the 
relatively smaller number of male employees, 
a high proportion of them work across 
our central support functions, in specialist, 
non-care related roles, that often command 
a higher rate of pay. However, across the 
business  over three quarters of our top 
quartile salary earners are women.

We believe that workplace satisfaction  
among colleagues contributes to our top

How we define  
and measure the 
gender pay gap

Within Four Seasons Health Care men and women doing 
the same or similar jobs, or who are working at the same 
level or value are paid equally. This is our long-standing 
policy and it is a legal requirement. The gender pay gap is 
distinct from this. It shows the difference in average pay 
between women and men, regardless of their role or  
the level at which they are working. 

The government requires that UK employers with 250+ 
employees report their gender pay gap (GPG).  
We are providing this information by: 

•  Colleagues working in our care homes
• 

 Colleagues in central support and management 
functions
 Specific data on each of the legal entities, each 
employing over 250 people, which together  
make up the majority of the Four Seasons Health 
Care business 

• 

This report shows the mean and median GPG, which 
illustrate different aspects of pay distribution across the 
organisation. The median is the mid-point hourly pay rate. 
This is calculated by taking all hourly pay rates, ordering them 
from lowest to highest, and identifying the middle-most rate. 
The mean is simply the average hourly pay rate. This is calculated 
by adding up all hourly pay rates and dividing the total by the 
number of employees. The median and mean figures are calculated 
and presented separately for men and women to show up any 
differences. The mean and median gender bonus gap (GBG) are 
calculated using the same methodology. 

We’re also reporting our pay quartiles split by gender, ranking 
our employees from lowest to highest paid, then splitting into 
four equal bands. This report is based on data collated and 
analysed at the end of the relevant pay period within which the 
snapshot date of the 5th April 2017 falls.

In our care and 
nursing homes

In our homes…

This summary overview is derived from data relating to circa 
10,000 colleagues working in more than 250 residential  
care, dementia care and nursing homes. These home-based 
colleagues typically include but are not limited to: carers, nurses, 
activities co-ordinators, house-keeping, maintenance, catering 
teams and administrators 

The homes are operated under a number of 
different legal entities, although this is simply 
a legacy of how, in the past, the business 
developed by a combination of organic 
growth and by acquisition.

In total 18 of these legal entities have more 
than 250 employees and are therefore 
reportable for GPG purposes.

• 

 On a median basis the overall GPG is 0.8%, 
which is significantly lower than the UK 
average of 18.1%

•  On a mean basis the overall GPG is 0.9% 
•  82.7% of the workforce are women

The main reason for the slight gender pay 
gap is that there are significantly more 
women than men in carer roles, which on 
a national basis tend to be lower paid. The 
proportion of male employees increases from 
14.6% in the lowest paid quartile to 18.9% in 
the upper quartile. 

This means that in our care homes c 80% of 
colleagues in the upper quartile are female. 

Almost all of our colleagues are full time 
members of our permanent team with 
contracted hours and the usual sickness, 
holiday, pension and other entitlements. 

There are some exceptions who find it suits 
their personal circumstances better to join 
our “bank” of colleagues who work shifts 
by agreement, covering during absence 
through sickness or holidays or at times of 
peak demand. We try to be family friendly and 
flexible about hours of work as far as we can. 

We have a recognition agreement in place 
with GMB, RCN and UNISON, which ensures 
that colleagues working within our care 
homes have a collective voice when it  
comes to pay related issues.

We want to attract good people to join us 
and to stay and grow with us. Our learning 
and development team supports colleagues 
to enhance their skills and to develop 
personally whilst advancing their careers. 

For example, we have a preceptorship 
scheme for new graduate nurses and the 
Four Seasons Nurse Academy, which is a 
resource for all nurses, providing tailored 
learning and development whatever their 
development stage. This includes learning 
and development for those who want to 
progress to a home management role. 

For experienced Care Assistants, we offer  
a range of Careership programmes.

These programmes, tailored for Four 
Seasons, enable our carers to progress their 
careers with us and are aligned to the Skills 
for Care apprenticeship standards for Level 
2: Adult Care Worker and Level 3: Lead 
Adult Care Worker.

For those who want to step up to new 
challenges and to advance, we have 
the Care Home Assistant Practitioner 
(CHAP) role, which provides promising 
Care Assistants with the opportunity to 
develop their skills to support Registered 
Nurses. After successful completion of 
the structured learning programme the 
CHAPs will undertake routine procedures 
for which they have been assessed as 
competent, working under the supervision 
of a Registered Nurse.

As new standards are authorised for delivery, 
we also plan to deliver tailored programmes 
aligned to apprenticeship standards at Level 
4: Lead Practitioner in Adult Care and Level 5: 
Leader in Adult Care.

“Four Seasons has a joint recognition 
agreement with GMB, Royal College 
of Nursing and UNISON, based on 
our shared understanding that high 
standards of care are best achieved by 
having good employee relations and 
a workforce who are well-trained and 
motivated. These things require that 
colleagues are able to see there is a 
commitment to fairness and equality  
of opportunity.” GMB, RCN, UNISON

In our central  
support services

This summary is based on data for approximately 1020 
colleagues who are assigned to Four Seasons Health 
Care Group Limited. They comprise largely of Home 
Managers, Regional Managers, members of various 
teams such as finance, insurance, estates management, 
legal, marketing, HR, quality assurance etc.

•  On a mean basis the overall GPG is 9% 

• 

• 

 On a median basis the overall GPG is 17.1% which is slightly 
lower than the UK average at 18.1%

 Employees across Four Seasons Health Care Group Limited  
are predominantly female, making up just over 78% of  
the workforce

The main cause of the GPG is that there are more women than 
men across all roles but with an increase in the number of men as 
you move up through the pay quartiles. The proportion of male 
employees increases from 14.2% in the lowest paid quartile to 
23.9% in the upper quartile. This means that c 76% of those in the 
upper quartile are women.

Overall a higher proportion of female employees than male 
employees received a bonus. Among female employees 40.4% 
received a bonus versus 31.4% of male employees. On a median 
basis the GBG is -3.8%, with the minus meaning the gap is in 
favour of women. 

The fact that among the smaller overall number of male 
employees a higher proportion of them are in higher paid roles, 
means that male employees received higher bonuses on average 
and so the GBG on a mean basis is 14.1%. However, there is 
no gender difference in bonus payments when expressed as a 
proportion of salary.
