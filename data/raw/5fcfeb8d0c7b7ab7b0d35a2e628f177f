Limited 
2017 Gender Pay Gap Report 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With effect from 6 April 2017 legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish 
certain statistics in relation to hourly pay and the bonuses paid, broken down by gender.  
 
Gender pay reporting shows the difference between earnings for men and women as a % of men’s 
earnings. The figure is intended to provide a high level indicator of earning power, show inequalities 
in the market and to apply pressure on employers to reduce any material gap. These figures are not 
the same as equal pay as gender pay reporting is impacted by the weighting of men and women at 
senior levels within a firm.

The mean hourly pay gap is the difference in the average hourly pay rate (sum of hourly rates divided 
by the number) for women compared with men across the organisation. 
 
The  median  hourly  rate  is  the  middle  value  across  all  hourly  rates.  The  median  pay  gap  is  the 
difference between the median rate for women compared with the median rate for men. 
 
Punter Southall Administration Limited’s (PSAL) gender pay gap is a result of women holding fewer 
senior positions than men.  
 

 

The calculations in this statement are based on a snapshot of hourly rates of pay on 5 April 2017 and bonuses paid in the 
12 months up to 5 April 2017.

Hourly Pay Quartiles  
 
The hourly pay quartiles split the employees into equal quarters and show the proportion of men and 
women in four pay bands. All men and women’s hourly pay rates are ranked from the lowest to the 
highest to create four equal bands.

the preceding 12 months, together with the ‘bonus gap’ statistics in relation to these bonuses.

These results are also impacted by the higher proportion of males in senior positions and furthermore 
the fact that more senior staff have higher levels of variable pay.  In particular, the mean bonuses 
above are heavily impacted by the bonuses paid to four employees. 
 
 
Ben Bramhall, Co-Chief Executive Officer, Xafinity plc said: 
 
Following detailed analysis of our gender pay gap, we are confident there is no material difference 
between the pay for men and women in similar roles at Punter Southall Administration Limited.  Our 
significant gender pay gap reflects a higher proportion of males than females in similar positions. 

We have a number of initiatives in place to improve the diversity of our workforce at all levels, and 
specifically to increase the number of females in senior positions, which we believe will greatly benefit 
the business. 
 
 
I confirm the data reported is accurate.
