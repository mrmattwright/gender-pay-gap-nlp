April 2017, all organisations that employ over 250 employees are required to report annually on their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is defined as the differences in the average earnings of men and women over a standard period of time, regardless of their role seniority.    At World of Books we are committed to the principles of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability.    Gender pay and bonus gap  Difference between men and women        Mean (average)  Median (middle)    Gender Pay Gap  0.12%  0%    Gender Bonus Gap  22.07%  40%       Proportion of employees receiving a bonus       Male  Female    64.61%  59%       The gender bonus pay gap difference is due to there being a higher proportion of female employees working part time and receiving a pro rata bonus.    Pay quartiles  Proportions of males and females in each pay quartile (each quartile contains 114 or 115 employees)        Male  Female    Quartile 4  61.40%  38.60%    Quartile 3  72.81%  27.19%    Quartile 2  75.65%  24.35%    Quartile 1  59.65%  40.35%       We confirm that the data provided is accurate and in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.    Stephen Boobyer CEO   Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement  Introduction  This statement sets out the actions we are taking at World of Buzz to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions and activities during the financial year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019.  The organisation recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human trafficking.  The organisation is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.   Organisational structure and supply chains  This statement covers the activities of World of Buzz:   Buyer of second-hand books and media  Online seller of second-hand books and media  Developer of Software   The organisation currently operates in the following countries:   World of Buzz has offices in the UK, Australia and Hungary.   World of Buzz collects from Charitable Organisations based in the UK and its processing operations are all based within the UK with the work conducted by its own employees.Â  All employees are paid at least the appropriate National Minimum Wage. The organisation therefore considers there to be a very low risk in relation to slavery and human trafficking so has taken no specific action in relation to these relationships.  We are putting in place a process to audit existing suppliers and to develop a supplier approval process for new suppliers going forward.   Responsibility  Responsibility for the organisation's anti-slavery initiatives will be with the CEO.   Training  Given what World of Buzz understands to be a low risk profile for a supplier of goods, no specific training is provided or undertaken by us in relation to these matters.Â  World of Buzz will continue to assess any additional measures required as it acquires new suppliers or offer different business activities   Due diligence  The organisation will undertake due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers   Approval  This statement has been approved by the CEO, who will review and update it annually.   ______________  Stephen Boobyer  CEO        World of Books   About Us  Blog  Careers  Facebook  WholesaleÂ Books     Help   Book Condition  Contact Us  FAQ  Shipping Information     Rare Books    Website  Blog  Ephemera Store     Â© World of Books Ltd | 2018 Terms , Privacy and Returns Policy & Copyright
