Explore          History  A den of iniquity  Take a look at a mid-19th century map of Deansgate in Manchester and you will see an area marked Spinningfields; a maze of tenements and communal courtyards. The area was described as a “den of iniquity” and although opium dens could be found, alcohol was the drug of choice. Spinningfields was said to be “teeming with gin and ale houses”, an apt birthplace for the very first Alchemist.
