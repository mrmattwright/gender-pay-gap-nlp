WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?
The gender pay gap is the di(cid:31) erence between men’s and women’s average hourly pay across an 
organisation, expressed as a percentage. It is reported as a mean and median average ﬁ gure, based 
on those working on a given day (5th April, 2017). In the UK the current national median gender pay 
gap is 18.4%*. The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay, which means that men and women 
are paid the same for carrying out the same role. *from O(cid:29)  ce for National Statistics ASHE survey 2017 

OUR GENDER PAY GAP
Our median pay gap is 10.41%, compared to a UK average of 18.4%, and is largely driven by the 
composition of our workforce. We have more women than men across our business in every quartile, 
but an increased proportion of men in the top quartile where we have more highly paid roles.

OUR BONUS PAY GAP
The composition of our workforce also contributes to our bonus pay gap. We are very supportive 
of  part-time  working  at  all  levels  with  up  to  20.5%  of  our  female  population  working  part-time 
(compared to 2% of our male workforce). As bonuses are based on pro-rata salary and there is no 
adjustment for this in the reported ﬁ gures, this negatively a(cid:31) ects our bonus pay gap. This e(cid:31) ect is 
magniﬁ ed by the number of part-time employees among our ﬁ fty highest paid people (ten female, 
one male). 

PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVING A 2016 BONUS

F : 79% M : 87%

100% of employees at HarperCollins are eligible for a bonus. However, 
the proportion of employees receiving a 2016 bonus (the ﬁ gures above) 
does not include new starters who are not yet eligible, which during the 
reporting period were predominantly female.

To fully understand the shape of our workforce we have split the data into deciles with decile one
being the lowest and decile ten the highest. Each represents a tenth of our workforce. 
(cid:127) Women make up the majority of each of the ﬁ rst nine deciles, and ﬁ fty percent of the tenth, meeting 
the Publishers Association inclusivity target of ﬁ fty percent of women in senior leadership level roles
(cid:127) Decile ten includes our Executive Committee which is composed of a male CEO plus eight men and 

eight women

While it is positive that our gender pay gap is lower than the UK average we know there is more 
we can do and we are committed to addressing the pay gap at HarperCollins. We have a high 
proportion of women across the business, however the proportion of men is highest in our upper 
quartile and this impacts our gender pay gap. In order to a(cid:31) ect positive change we have in place 
and  are  introducing  new  initiatives  to  encourage  both  the  retention  of  senior  women  and  the 
recruitment and progression of more women into senior roles.

(cid:127)  Continue to equip and empower our leaders and colleagues (up to executive level) 

ensuring that inclusivity and diversity are embedded in our learning and development 
programmes, in order to attract, develop and retain a diverse workforce

  CULTURE:

every level 

(cid:127)  Increase visible role-modelling of our senior female talent to encourage women to 

progress into leadership roles
