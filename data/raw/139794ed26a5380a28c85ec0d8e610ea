How we achieve this:   We actively recruit individuals with a lived experience of mental ill health and provide placements for employability services which often lead onto long term employment.  A service user or carer sits on every interview panel during NAViGOâ€™s recruitment and selection process.  We are a Disability Confident Employer.  Improving the physical health of service users, through the WHISE (Wellbeing and Health Improvement Service) project.  Audit of our buildings to ensure accessibility for those with protected characteristics.  Accessible information-all information leaflets produced by NAViGO are reviewed by service users/carers.  Mental Health Act leaflets are available on the NAViGO website in different languages.  Translation and interpretation services are available.  We provide a Dyslexia screening service and support for staff and service users having recognised a high incidence of undiagnosed dyslexia in the locality.  We have a newly formed youth forum ensuring we are mindful that age legislation refersÂ  Â Â Â Â to young people as well as the older generation.  All staff are required to undertake Equality & Diversity training which has specific reference to inequalities in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals from different cultures.  All services are required to submit equality impact assessments to the CCG which are reviewed by an independent group including expert patients.  All NAViGO policies include an Equality and Impact Assessment to ensure diversity matters have been carefully considered by the author and Clinical Governance Committee.
