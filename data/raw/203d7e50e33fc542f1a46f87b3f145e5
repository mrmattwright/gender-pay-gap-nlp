As a global business, YouGov has the resources to make a positive contribution to society and to the environment. We aim to continually improve our work in these areas.   Employee Engagement  The Company realises that engaged and informed employees will be productive employees. We recognise the importance of keeping employees informed of matters affecting them, such as the financial factors impacting the performance of the Company and developments in the industry in which we operate.  Information about the business, such as progress against our five year plan, is communicated to employees through regular briefings and town hall meetings, social events and our global intranet.  Gender Pay Gap Information Regulation  As part of our employee engagement in 2018, YouGov has voluntarily chosen to publish a gender pay gap information report. As an employer with less than 250 employees in the UK, YouGov plc is not required to publish gender pay gap information under the Equalities Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. In the spirit of transparency, we have decided to begin publishing data from 2017 onwards. You can view our full report here .  Diversity  The Company is committed to providing a working environment in which its employees are able to realise their potential and to contribute to the success of the business irrespective of gender identity, marital or civil partnership status, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, disability, sexual orientation or age.  Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full and fair consideration. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to retrain them in order that their employment with the Company may continue.  YouGov is a committed member of the UK government’s Disability Confident scheme which aims to challenge attitudes towards disability, increase understanding of disability, remove barriers in the workplace and ensure that disable people have the opportunities to fulfil their potential and realise their aspirations.  YouGov is a Global Diversity Champion with Stonewall, the leading employers’ programme in Britain for ensuring LGBT staff are accepted without exception in the workplace.  Professional Development  It is the policy of the Company that training, career development and promotion opportunities should be available to all employees.  Ownership  Employees are encouraged to own shares in the Company, and many employees are shareholders and/or hold options under the Company’s share option schemes.  Health and Safety  The Company takes all reasonable and practicable steps to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of its employees and those visiting its premises. The Company endeavours to continually improve its health and safety processes and procedures, to ensure that they remain fit-for-purpose.  Ethical Behaviour  YouGov expects its employees to exercise high ethical and moral standards at all times whilst representing the Company. The Company has an established Whistleblowing Procedure to enable employees to raise issues and an Anti-Bribery Policy. The Company also maintains an awareness of human rights issues.  Modern Slavery Act  As an ethical employer, YouGov takes the elimination of modern slavery and/or human trafficking practices from our supply chain seriously. Due to the nature of our business and our approach to governance, we assess that our supply chain is low risk but will keep this under assessment on a regular basis. Our statement on the elimination of modern slavery and human trafficking pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 can be found here .  Suppliers  The Company aims to pay all its suppliers within a reasonable period of their invoices being received and approved, provided that the supplier has performed in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions. See our Modern Slavery statement above for information on how we are working to eliminate modern slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain.  Community  The Company recognises the importance of respecting and supporting the communities in which it operates and, thus improving the positive impact of business in society. YouGov employees globally support their local communities and dedicate their time to charities and other causes. The Company aims to support these endeavours where possible, be it through provision of company resources or direct donations.  Environment  The Company recognises that the wise use of resources can reduce our impact on the environment whilst having financial benefits. As part of our overall approach to Corporate Social Responsibility, we aim to promote the maintenance of a healthy environment through responsible and sustainable consumption and production. Our operations are predominantly office based and we already embrace technology in our workplace. We therefore are able to minimise our impacts where practicable. Actions which we have taken include:   ensuring that all waste is disposed of responsibly and recycled where possible;  ensuring that paper used comes from reputable managed forests;  complying, where required, with relevant packaging and waste regulations; and  minimising air travel by embracing communications technology when appropriate.
