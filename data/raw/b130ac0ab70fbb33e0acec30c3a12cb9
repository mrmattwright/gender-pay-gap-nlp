				Gender pay gap   Gender pay gap   The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap) Regulations 2017 which came in to force on 6 April 2017 require relevant employers to publish a Gender Pay Gap Report which sets out the following information:   The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant equivalent employees  The difference between the median hourly rate of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees  The difference between the mean bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female relevant employees  The difference between the median bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female relevant employees  The proportions of male and female relevant employees who were paid bonus pay and  The proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands   The information is required to be published by 4 April 2018 and annually thereafter. The information for SB Cares for 2017/18 is shown below:      Hourly Rate    Male    Female    Difference      Mean    £9.9514    £9.9737    -.22%      Medium    £8.9956    £9.3856    -4.34%            Pay Quartiles    Male %    Female %      Top    9.46%    90.54%      Upper Middle    5.03%    94.97%      Lower Middle    6.82%    93.18%      Lower    15.86%    84.14%        We do not make bonus payments to either male or female staff.  Operational Context  SB Cares LLP provides care services, on behalf of Scottish Borders Council, in a number of settings.  We support 12,000 clients, families and carers, through care at home, support in Care Homes and Extra Care Housing, and day services. We provide rehabilitation equipment and offer an alarm monitoring service.  At 28 Feb 2017, SB Cares LLP employed 870 members of staff, 790 of them female, 80 male.  What do our calculations tell us?  The mean figure reports the difference between the average of men’s and women’s pay.  The median figure reports the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of men’s and women’s pay.  The gender pay gap data reports a mean pay gap of -0.22%. This means that females are on average, paid a rate which is 0.22% higher than males.  The gender pay gap expressed by comparing the median (middle value) pay rate shows that females are paid at a rate which is 4.34% higher than males.  The quartile analysis shows the predominance of females in the workforce across all pay grades, and that the quartile in which males are represented most is the lowest quartile.  What we know  The males that we do employ are most likely to be involved in roles such as technical support, cleaning, and warehouse duties.  The vast majority of caring roles, including those in managerial positions within care services, are undertaken by females.  Actions to help close the gap  We will continue to work in line with employment policies and practices which are designed to ensure we operate in a non discriminatory workplace.  We will continue to support recruiting managers to eliminate any unconscious bias in the recruitment process.  We will continue to ensure that our advertising is accessible for prospective employees of both genders.  We will look to use case studies in our recruitment literature which promote the career in the caring professions as a positive choice for males.  We will continue to monitor the gender pay gap in line with legislation and good management practice.
