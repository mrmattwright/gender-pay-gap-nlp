March 2017 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Gender Pay Gap legislation introduced in April 2017 requires South Gloucestershire 
Council to publish an annual gender pay gap report. 

The gender pay gap is an equality measure that shows the difference in average 
(mean and median) earnings between women and men, expressed as a percentage 
of male earnings.   

This is the Gender Pay Gap report for the snapshot date of 31 March 2017. 

The data set out in this report has been calculated using the standard methodologies 
used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  This 
includes calculating an hourly rate for all staff who were paid on the snapshot date 
using ordinary pay.  Ordinary pay is defined in regulation 3 as including basic pay, 
allowances, pay for piecework, pay for leave and shift premium pay.  Ordinary pay 
does not include pay related to overtime, redundancy or termination of employment. 
The calculation is based on gross pay after any reduction for a salary sacrifice 
scheme and any ordinary pay received in the relevant pay period that relates to a 
different pay period is excluded.

Gender Pay Gap 

 

 

Mean Gender Pay Gap: 11.8% 

Median Gender Pay Gap: 12.0% 

ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) October 2017 report states that 
the whole economy mean Gender Pay Gap is 17.4% whereas the Median Gender 
Pay Gap 18.4%. The data from the new Gender Pay Gap reporting requirement is 
not available for benchmarking at the time of the publication of this report. 

South Gloucestershire Council is committed to the principle of equal opportunities 
and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, 
marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender 
reassignment or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the 
same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out 
above). As such, it:

  carries out equal pay audits at regular intervals, the latest version is available 

on our website1; and 

  evaluates job roles and applies pay grades using the well-established and 

transparent HAY job evaluation process. 

The causes of the gender pay gap are complex and overlapping.  South 
Gloucestershire Council can demonstrate that we pay men and women the same for 
the same or equivalent work2.  Our gender pay gap is reflective of the causes of 
gender pay gap at a societal level. 

Across the UK economy as a whole, men are more likely than women to be in senior 
roles (especially very senior roles at the top of organisations), while women are more 
likely than men to be in front-line roles which tend to attract lower salaries. Research 
has also identified that, although parents are increasingly flexible, the responsibility 
of childcare still falls disproportionately upon women3. Women are also more likely 
than men to have had breaks from work that have affected their career progression, 
for example to bring up children. They are also more likely to work part-time, and 
many of the jobs that are available across the UK on a part-time basis are relatively 
low paid. Research has identified that very few men work part-time; 60% of working 
fathers work more than 40 hours a week compared to just a third of working 
mothers4. 

Bonus Pay 

South Gloucestershire Council does not pay bonuses. 

Quartile Pay 

The quartile data table below shows South Gloucestershire Council’s workforce 
divided into four equal-sized groups based on calculated hourly pay rates, each 
quartile made up of 25% the workforce.  The lowest-paid 25% of employees are the 
lower quartile and the highest-paid 25% are the upper quartile.

The South Gloucestershire Council workforce is predominantly female, made up of 
68.7% female and 31.3% male which explains why there is a higher percentage of 
females across all quartiles.  For there to be no gender pay gap, the percentages 
within each of the quartiles would reflect the gender percentages of the makeup of 
the workforce (i.e. 68.7% female and 31.3% male). 

The biggest percentage difference is within the upper quartile (highest paid) where 
there is a much higher percentage of males; 42.4% of the upper quartile is male 
compared to the actual workforce which is 31.3% male, a difference of 11.1%.   

Likewise, the lower quartile shows a higher percentage of female workers; 76.4% 
when compared to the actual workforce which is 68.7% female, an increase of 7.7%.   

This would suggest that the gender pay gap is due to more female workers 
undertaking lower paid roles than men, which ties in with the research above and the 
UK economy as a whole.   

What is South Gloucestershire Council doing 
to address its gender pay gap? 

South Gloucestershire Council is committed to improving the gender pay gap.  

The Equal Pay Audit5 sets out steps that the council is already taking to help close 
the gender pay gap, and other planned steps are included within the Annual 
Equalities in Employment report6:

A programme of positive action is underway, to include: a career 
development programme open to all council staff and tailored training 
programmes aimed at increasing the number of women in 
management roles. Which would fall into our upper quartile pay? 

Significant action to develop and reinvigorate staff equalities groups 
has been taken, which includes a group for women. 

Ensuring Flexible working practices promote equality of opportunity in 
the workforce e.g. adoption leave, childcare vouchers, dependants 
care leave, flexible working, homeworking, maternity leave, parental 
leave, paternity leave. South Gloucestershire council provide 
enhanced benefits above the statutory entitlement for many of these 
areas. 

Continue existing good practice to take a fair and consistent approach 
to pay and grading through robust job evaluation processes. 

Compliance with equalities legislation. 

Continue to produce and publish an Annual Equalities in Employment 
report in order to assess a wide range of equalities in employment 
issues and continue to report on, monitor and review an annual 
Gender Pay Gap report. 

Continue to publish a welcome message on our recruitment website 
stating that South Gloucestershire Council is committed to treating 
everyone fairly, to challenging inequalities and to promoting equality of 
opportunity for all. We welcome applications from everyone and value 
diversity in our workforce.
