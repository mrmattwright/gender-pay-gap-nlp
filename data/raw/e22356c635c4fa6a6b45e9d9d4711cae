It is the firm’s aim to create an environment that respects the diversity of our employees and enables them to achieve their full potential, to contribute fully, and to derive maximum benefit and enjoyment from their contribution throughout their career with us.   Gender Pay Gap  We welcome the requirement for employers to publish gender pay figures which we believe will give employers the impetus to change where change is needed. To view our Gender Pay Gap Report (April 2017), click here .    Working Forward Pledge  Retaining female talent is absolutely critical for the economy and for the businesses that fuel it. There has been significant progress over the last decade in the introduction of family-friendly working arrangements, yet women are still more likely than men to be in low-paying jobs and are under-represented in senior positions. In 2017 we therefore became members of the Nationwide Working Forward campaign which pledges to make workplaces the best they can be for pregnant women and new parents. The pledge sets out four areas where companies can really make a difference for pregnant women and new mothers.  These are:   Demonstrating leadership from the top down  Ensuring confident employees  Training and supporting line managers  Offering flexible working practices.   We at Malcolm Hollis are committed to fulfilling these four pledge areas.    RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark  Malcolm Hollis are a proud signatory to the RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark. The RICS launched the Quality Mark at the start of 2016 and its aim is to drive behaviour changes in the membership by encouraging all firms, large and small, to look carefully at their employment practices and have inclusivity at the heart of what they do. Membership is voluntary and self-assessed, but by signing up to the scheme it means that we are committed to improving inclusivity according to the six principles outlined by the RICS and committed to monitoring performance on a bi-annual basis.  There are six principles of the Inclusive Employer Quality Mark that define the RICS’s aims and the values they expect adopters to practice.  These are: ​   Leadership and Vision  – Demonstrable commitment at the highest level to increasing the diversity of the workforce.  Recruitment – Engage and attract new people to the industry from under-represented groups; best practice recruitment methods.  Staff Development – Training and promoting policies that offer equal access to career progression for all members of the workforce.  Staff Retention – Flexible working arrangements and adaptive working practices that provide opportunities for all to perform at their highest levels.  Staff Engagement – An inclusive culture where all staff engage with developing, delivering, monitoring and assessing the diversity and inclusivity policies.  Continuous Improvement – Continually refreshing and renewing the firm’s commitment to being the best employer; sharing and learning from best practice across the industry.
