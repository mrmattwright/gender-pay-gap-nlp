Wilf Walsh, Carpetright CEO said:  “We take equality seriously at Carpetright and are pleased to report gender pay gap figures which are well-below the national and retail average.  With a historically male-dominated business, gender is a real focus for us and we’re working hard to attract more female colleagues into the company.  Additionally, we are confident we have no issues of equal pay, and we are focused on reducing the gap further.”  What is the Gender Pay Gap?  All companies with 250 or more relevant employees are now required to report on specific gender pay information annually.  It is a measure of the difference between the average earnings of men and women across an organisation, regardless of the nature of their work. The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay, which relates to men and women being paid equally for equal work.  Businesses are required to report on a set of standard measures which are calculated in a set way, these include: The difference between average hourly rates for male and female colleagues, expressed as both mean and median averages. The difference between the average amount of bonus earned between male and female colleagues, again expressed as mean and median averages. The percentage of male and female colleagues who have received a bonus and the percentage of male and female colleagues in each pay quartile.
