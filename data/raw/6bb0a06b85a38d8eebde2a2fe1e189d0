What is the gender pay gap?

The gender pay gap is the difference in the average earnings between men and women, 
regardless of the roles they do. Companies with over 250 employees are required to share 
some key information on pay gap (shown on page 2) using the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.
Gender pay differs from ‘equal pay’, which looks at pay differences between people carrying 
out the same or comparable work.

Our analysis suggests that our gender pay gap stems from factors which 
are common to our industry not from equal pay issues, including:

More men in senior roles.

More women in 
part time roles.

More men in roles with shift 

pay and other working 

pattern allowances.

Our people
We employ over 5,000 people and it’s important to us that all our employees can be 
themselves at work and are able to give their best. We’re working hard to become a more 
inclusive organisation.

Our gender pay gap, 5 April 2017 was 13.3%
This is the difference in mean (average) hourly rate between men and women. 
The Office of National Statistics reported a 17.4% mean gender pay gap for all UK workers in 
October 2017. 
Our gap is lower than the national average, however there is lots more to do to become a truly 
inclusive organisation. 
All of these figures have been calculated according to the gender pay gap reporting 
regulations. Hourly rates include basic pay, allowances and shift premium pay, but not 
overtime. More information on the regulations, and types of pay included in the calculations, 
can be found on the ACAS website.

Quartile pay band distribution
Quartile pay band distribution is calculated by ranking the hourly rate of all employees from 
the highest to the lowest paid, dividing this list into four equal parts and working out the 
percentage of males and females in each of the four parts.

All of this data broadly supports the view that a key driver in our gender pay gap is the lower 
proportion of women in more senior roles. 
The inclusion of shift pay and other working pattern allowances in the calculations, coupled 
with the greater proportion of males eligible to receive such allowances is another factor 
which has attributed to our pay gap. 
In addition to this, bonus opportunity increases with seniority, widening the bonus gap.

What are we doing to close the gap?

Sponsoring female 
managers to attend 
leadership masterclasses 
to build confidence and 
break down barriers.

Training our people as 
mentors to support 
others seeking to return 
to work after a prolonged 
period of time.

We are committed to the 
Equality Act 2010 and 
ensuring both applicants 
and employees have 
equal opportunity, fair 
treatment, and a safe 
workplace.

As well as this, we’re 
a Stonewall Diversity 
Champion and a Disability 
Confident Employer.

We’re working to 
understand in more 
detail the causes behind 
our gap, to continue to 
develop appropriate 
actions.

Developing career 
pathways, talent pipelines 
and succession planning. 
Extending our recruitment 
and practices to attract a 
wider audience.

Continuing to expand 
our internal and external 
diversity networks.

Continuing to update our 
facilities to ensure that all 
our sites are appropriate 
for all employees.

Our gender pay gap information in this 
statement is accurate as of 5 April 2017.
