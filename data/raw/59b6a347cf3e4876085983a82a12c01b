STOBART GROUP

Stobart Group is one of the UK’s leading infrastructure and support service businesses operating in the renewable energy, aviation and 
rail civil engineering sectors as well as having investments in a national property and logistics portfolio.

Within this document we will be reporting on Stobart Rail Limited and London Southend Airport Company Limited, these being companies within 
Stobart Group that employ over 250 employees and part of our Rail and Aviation divisions respectively. 

Stobart Group recognises that in order to attract talent and build a sustainable business we need to ensure that we are working towards 
becoming a truly inclusive and diverse organisation. Although our results are consistent with other businesses in our sector there is always more 
that we can do to address this balance.

The MEAN pay gap
The mean gender pay gap is the difference in the average hourly pay 
for women compared to men, within our business. 

The MEDIAN pay gap
The median represents the middle point of a population. In simple 
terms, if you separately lined up all the women in a company and all 
the men, the median pay gap is the difference between the hourly pay 
rate for the middle woman compared to that of the middle man.

Our gender mix is what creates our gap as we have a higher 
proportion of males in higher paid roles. This is shown in the chart 
above which ranks all our colleagues pay from lowest to highest 
and then divides it into four equal groups with the first group 
(Quartile 1) being the lowest paid. This analysis shows that there are 
proportionally more male colleagues than female colleagues in the 
highest paid quartile. 

An additional major contributing factor to our imbalance within Stobart 
Rail Limited is the fact that the Rail industry is a male dominated sector 
due to the physical nature of many of the roles. Within this sector there 
is also a shortage of suitably qualified candidates, both male and 
female, for more senior positions. It can be challenging to recruit for 
these positions and we often have to rely on recruitment agencies to 
source appropriately qualified candidates.

TAKING ACTION

Moving forward we will evolve our working environment and culture 
whereby our people are fully encouraged and supported to achieve 
their full potential irrespective of their gender. It is important to us that 
we implement and achieve sustainable solutions to the imbalance 
within our businesses and we are aware that it is going to take some 
time for us to get to where we would like to be. Making sure equality 
and inclusion is at the heart of our organisational culture is a key part 
of our future action plans. Our priority actions are: 

•  We will ensure inclusive recruitment from end to end, helping 

to remove any unconscious bias that may occur during the 
recruitment and selection process. We will also be concentrating 
on making senior positions within our business more attractive to 
women and will look to other industries for transferable skills. 

• 

There will be renewed focus on performance appraisals and 
individual objectives to ensure career development and succession 
planning for all of our employees, irrespective of gender. 

•  We already have agile and flexible working policies which operate 

at all pay levels, including maternity, paternity and shared 
parental leave. We will be improving communications to ensure 
that these policies are fully understood and utilised by both males 
and females.

Within the workforce population upon which we are reporting, there 
are no females receiving a bonus and there is also a very low number 
of males receiving a bonus. We recognise that the “bonus gap” is 
therefore 100%. Our bonuses tend to be paid to more senior positions 
within our organisation where we currently have a much higher 
proportion of men than women.
