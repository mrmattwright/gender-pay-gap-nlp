PRP is an LLP which has employees as well as 'Members', most of which are Associates Director level upwards. Whilst we are required to include members of our LLP, or 'Partners', in our headcount, they are not used as part of the Gender Pay calculations. We included all relevant employees as at April 2017, the 'snapshot date', when calculating our Gender Pay figures. Our Gender Pay calculations (all relevant employees) as at 5 April 2017 were as follows: Average Hourly Pay     The Mean Gender Pay Gap  18.85%    The Median Gender Pay Gap  20.79%    Average bonus     The Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap  45.37%    The Median Bonus Gender Pay Gap  32.86%    The Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment     Male  58.18%    Female  63.48%    Quartile Pay Bands  Lower Quartile    Male  18  32.73%    Female  37  67.27%    Total  55      Lower Middle Quartile    Male  24  43.64%    Female  31  56.36%    Total  55      Upper Middle Quartile    Male  27  49.09%    Female  28  50.91%    Total  55      Upper Quartile    Male  40  72.73%    Female  15  27.27%    Total  55      Analysis of the figures It is important to highlight that at this 'snapshot date', there were a number of male employees, (Associate Director and Director level), who had not yet become LLP members (Partners). Female employees with these job titles were already LLP members, and their earnings (drawings) are therefore not included.  Not all Associate Directors and Directors become members. Those in this category are all male. Without male Associate Directors and Directors, there is a notable impact on the figures that sees the gap reduce quite considerably. Average Hourly Pay     The Mean Gender Pay Gap  11.65%    The Median Gender Pay Gap  18.81%    Average bonus     The Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap  27.03%    The Median Bonus Gender Pay Gap  24.19%    The Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment     Male  53.06%    Female  53.85%    The Gender Pay and Bonus Gap figures are further reduced when non-architectural employees are also removed. Average Hourly Pay     The Mean Gender Pay Gap  8.40%    The Median Gender Pay Gap  17.60%    Average bonus     The Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap  22.32%    The Median Bonus Gender Pay Gap  23.08%    The pay and bonus gaps have significantly reduced compared to the original figures (8.40% compared to 18.85% Mean Pay and 22.32% compared to 45.37% Mean Bonus for example). The disparity in bonus, as at the snapshot date (April 2017), was due to group sizes where London architecture was the largest and the most profitable, but with fewer female associates, compared to smaller groups such as Manchester, Surrey, Landscape, Planning and Support, which had more female Associates, but were less profitable. Within these groups, the bonus structure is evenly applied.  The pay gap (less AD's, Directors and non-architectural employees), is mainly due to a greater male technical headcount which inevitably means both mean and median calculations are impacted creating a difference. Importantly, when hourly pay and bonus of females and males in equivalent roles are assessed side by side, they are comparable. We do not have distinct pay bands, which places greater emphasis on remuneration based on skills and experience and therefore comparisons have to be made against male and female employees. Within these groups annual salary increases are evenly applied and based on role level. Further observations relating to the quartiles, which have not had senior members of staff or non-architectural staff removed, are that we have a slightly higher proportion of females in more junior roles (Part 1's) and support roles where populations tend to be predominantly female. Upper quartile figures highlight a stronger proportion of males at this level, even with AD's and Directors removed, and when analysed is simply a reflection of the gender imbalance which is symptomatic of this industry. Our on-going commitment to equality Whilst the construction industry is renowned for having a predominantly male population and this inevitably extends to the architectural discipline, PRP will carry on championing equality in our workplace. Since the snapshot date, the number of female associates at our London studio has increased and will continue to do so where skillsets and experience are clearly demonstrated. The proportion of female employees qualifying as architects has notably gone up compared to male employees. We will always strive to actively support the career progression and development of all employees irrespective of gender. In addition to this, as our employee numbers have been increasing, we have seen a higher ratio of females recruited compared to males in the last year. Lastly, one key point is that we have a strong female presence within our leadership team. This is something we are very proud of and bears testament to our approach to equality at PRP.
