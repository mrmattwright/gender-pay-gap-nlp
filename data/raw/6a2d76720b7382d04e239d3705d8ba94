COMMENTS ON GENDER PAY GAP  

Maxi Haulage complies with all legislation in relation to equal pay for both men and women 
in similar work. The company is careful to ensure all employees are paid on an equal basis 
for the same roles subject to only seniority, length of service or ability variations. 

As a Haulage Contractor many of our employees are drivers and warehouse staff, while 
male and females are paid exactly the same for these positions there are very few females 
following careers in this sector with only a small percentage of LGV licence holders in the UK 
being women. 

The Company`s statistics reveal a significantly lower gender pay gap when compared to 
National and Industry Specific sectors.
