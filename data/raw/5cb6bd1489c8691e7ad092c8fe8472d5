The University is also bound by legal obligations and reporting requirements in relation to equality data.  We have to provide information to organisations like HESA through compulsory reporting of staff and student data and the Public Sector Equality Act requires us to monitor personal information (e.g. Age, Disability, Gender and Ethnicity) and to make this information available publicly.  The following staff and student data pages can be accessed by staff only.

Gender Pay Gap Report   From 2017, all employers with 250 or more employees must publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap, which is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings.  The figures are published at a ‘snapshot date’ which for public sector employers is 31 March 2017.  The purpose of Gender Pay Gap reporting is to achieve greater gender equality across the UK and increase pay transparency.  Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 (DOCX)  To view national figures relating to gender pay gap information, visit https://www.gov.uk/government/news/view-gender-pay-gap-information .  To view data from other universities, follow the Government's gender pay gap link above and select 'Download Data'.  Once downloaded, apply filters and type ‘universities’ into the search function to compare gender pay gap data.            Guidance on Equality Monitoring Questions  Advice on how to word the equality monitoring elements of your survey can be found by viewing the latest guidance from the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU).           Public Sector Equality Duty Report   The Equality Act 2010 introduced a General Public Sector Equality Duty, which as a University, Leeds Beckett has to meet.
