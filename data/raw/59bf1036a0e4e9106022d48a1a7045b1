We are required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay 

Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 

This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men 

and women in our organisation. 

The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any Gender Pay gap. 

We will publish the results on our own website and a government website. Our data must be published by 

the 4 April 2018. 

 

Why is Gender Pay reporting important? 

Gender pay gap reporting shows the difference in the average earnings of all men and all women in an 

organisation. 

In order to measure the difference two calculations are made: 

1.  The mean gender pay gap reveals the difference between the mean hourly rates of pay of male full 

pay relevant employees and that of female full pay relevant employees.  

2.  The median gender pay gap reveals the difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male 

full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.

The data from our mean gender survey has been benchmarked against participants in the XpertHR 

Gender Pay Gap Reporting Service.  Our data has also been benchmarked against data from the Office for 

National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings of 2016.   This has provided us with data which 

represents an average for UK organisation who participated in the survey and data which represents 

organisations in the ‘not for profit’ sector. 

 

Our Results 

We are delighted to announce that we have a mean and median pay gap which shows that we are 

significantly lower than the UK average gender pay gap and significantly lower than the average for the 

‘not for profit’ sector. 

 

Mean result: 

The result of our mean Gender Pay gap is negative 7.8% 

This result reflects a mean male hourly rate of £13.09 and a mean female hourly rate of £14.11. 

A negative figure reveals that typically male employees have a lower rate of pay than female employees. 

The mean percentage is calculated by adding up all the wages of all employees and then dividing it by 

the number of employees in the sample.   

Median result 

Our median gender pay gap percentage is plus 6.1%. 

This figure is based on a median male hourly rate of £11.50 and a median female hourly rate of £10.80.   

This shows that when calculating our gender pay gap using the median percentage which is ascertained 

by comparing the female employee who is paid in the middle range of all female employees in the 

sample, against the male employee who is paid in the middle range of all male employees in the sample 

our female employees have a lower hourly paid rate than men. 

 

How does our result compare to other organisations? 

The mean UK average ‘Whole sample’ score is 17.1%.  This means that our result is significantly below 

that of the UK average.  

If we compare our results to that of the ‘not for profit’ sector organisations within the survey which has a 

score of 9.6% we are still below that of our sector comparators. 

 

Therefore, we can be confident that our female employees are not experiencing a gender pay gap.  

However, when we look out our median reporting figure the result is slightly different.

The Median figure shows a more typical representation of pay and is not distorted by large or small pay 

gap differences in certain areas of the organisation.  This is important for YMCA SPG to note as the 

gender make-up of our workforce is significantly imbalanced as two thirds of our workforce is female.  

 

Our median gender pay gap result of plus 6.1% does reveal a gender pay gap that shows that women are 

paid less than men.  However once again we are still significantly below the whole sample median 

average which is given as 14.6% and we are still below the not profit sector average of 7.2%.  

Pay quartiles 

 

This section of the report divides the workforce into four equally sized groups and takes note of the 

hourly pay rate.  Band A reflects the lowest paid 25% of employees and Band D reflects the highest paid 

25% of employees.  In order for there to be little or no gender pay gap there will need to be the same 

ratio of men to women in each quartile band.  An organisation with a high ratio of men to women in Band 

D is likely to have a gender pay gap, as is an organisation with a high ratio of women in Band A likely to 

have a gender pay gap.

When considering the percentage of employees who make up the highest paid quartile of staff (Band D) 

we have 66.2% of females in the category and 33.8% of men.  This is relative to the gender profile of our 

workforce which is which is two thirds female. 

When considering the percentage of employees who make up the lowest paid quartile of staff (Band A) 

we have 71.9% of female and 28.1% of males in this category which again reflects the make up of our 

workforce.  

The ratio of female to male employees show little change in the middle two quartiles.  As we have an 

even distribution of female to male across all four quartiles we can be confident that we are consistent in 

our approach to pay across all parts of our association and we can see no trend that gives rise to unequal 

pay concern.  

 

Bonus Pay 

 

We have not provided statistics on the mean/median gender bonus gap as we do not pay bonuses to 

staff. 

 

Context  

The snapshot date for this survey is the 5 April 2017 which is four days following the merger of YMCA 

London South West with YMCA East London. 

However, the information which was used to calculate gender pay gap report was information taken from 

the March 2017 payroll.  Therefore, it reflects staff pay in March 2017.  This means that the data used 

will have included staff were employed by both YMCA EL and YMCA LSW prior to the merger.

Since the merger a review of the roles and pay of the Executive Team structure has taken place which 

may paint a different picture when we undertake the pay gap survey on the snapshot date the 2018/19 

gender pay reporting period. 

 

We also have a large number of staff on part-time or zero hour contracts (which typically pay lower than 

full time staff; as the median hourly rate for part-time workers is £8.44 whereas the full time median 

hourly rate is £13.39). This can have a negative impact upon gender pay as women are 3 times more 

likely to be working part time than men. (UK Gov, Think, Act Report).  

 

Next steps 

 

We will use our results to assess: 

 

 

the levels of gender equality in our workplace 

the balance of male and female employees at different levels 

  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded. 

In order to assess this we will:  

Introduce a new grading system across the YMCA SPG 

1.  Present separate gender pay gap figures for full time and part time employees  
2. 
3.  Measure the number of women and men in each pay band 
4. 
5.  Monitor the number of employees promoted by gender 
6.  Monitor the starting salary of male and female staff on appointment 

Introduce family friendly policies to increase retention of women in senior roles
