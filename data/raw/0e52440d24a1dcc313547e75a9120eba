We operate an equal opportunities policy. PayPoint’s culture is one of openness, honesty and accountability and we recognise that all employees play a part in delivering the group’s performance.        All employees across the group participate in an annual employee engagement survey.     PayPoint seeks to improve its employees’ working environment. Employees are invited to participate in two staff meetings a year where the directors present the performance of the group. In addition, regular staff meetings and functional meetings take place throughout the year at our various offices. PayPoint believes that keeping its employees informed of new developments and products as well as the financial performance of the group motivates the employees and helps them understand the group’s progress towards its goals and objectives.
