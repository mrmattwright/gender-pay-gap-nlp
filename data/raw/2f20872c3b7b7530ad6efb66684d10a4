Hourly Pay by Quartile 

The 2017 national median pay gap was 18.2%, ours is 
substantially lower at 11.2%. We are proud of our values and 
recruitment practices which encourage equality, diversity and 
inclusion. 

*MKC doesnâ€™t operate a bonus scheme. However, a small number of 
one-off payments took place for 9 employees from a total of 1402. The 
proportion of males receiving a bonus payment is 1.27% and females 
receiving a bonus is 0.32%.

The higher % of women in the lower quartile is indicative of the education sector and demonstrates that 
part time, term time only and flexible hours contracts are more attractive to women.

As an organisation we engage 
with Women Leaders MK, last 
year 3 inspirational leaders from 
our organisation were 
nominated for awards.  

MKC has female leaders in the most senior roles 
including the CEO, COO and Executive Director for 
Offender Learning.   

How will we make a difference? 
We know, that currently the median gender pay gap within our management contracts (54 males & 118 
females) is not an issue at 0.0% difference, evidencing the culture and support for females to progress to 
management roles at MKC.  

The gender pay gap analysis acknowledges we have some areas for improvement and we are committed 
to closing these gaps.  We will not be complacent in our endeavours to improve this. We will continue to 
promote and harness an inclusive and supportive working environment, through our journey and beyond 
the accreditation process for Leaders in Diversity.
