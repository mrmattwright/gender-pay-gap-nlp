I confirm that the information in this statement is accurate and has been calculated according to the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. ’  Ian Thomas, Chief Executive  March 2018           The gender pay gap is defined as the difference in median pay between men and women.  The Office for National Statistics report that the gender pay gap in the UK has fallen from 10.5% in 2011 to 9.1% in 2017, but remains positive in value, meaning that on average men are paid more than women.  In an attempt to increase awareness and improve pay equality, the UK government has introduced compulsory reporting of the gender pay gap for organisations with 250 or more employees.  Trivallis is committed to closing the gender pay gap and is pleased to provide its first gender pay gap report, which has been calculated using the ‘snapshot date’ of 5 April 2017:                 It’s not unequal pay that explains our gap because we have conducted an equal pay audit to confirm that we offer equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender.  We regularly review the pay of all our job roles using independent market testing.              Although we are pleased with this year’s results, we will not become complacent.  We will regularly review our gender pay gap and seek to continuously improve the experience of all our employees in respect of equality, diversity and inclusion.
