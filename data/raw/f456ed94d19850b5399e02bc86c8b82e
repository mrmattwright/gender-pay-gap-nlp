THE GENDER PAY GAP

73%

of board members are

FEMALE

MALE

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average 
hourly pay and bonuses of all men and women in an 
organisation regardless of role.

It should not be confused with equal pay which is paying 
individuals performing the same or a similar role the same. 
It has been illegal not to do so in the UK since 1970. 

EQUAL PAY

We conduct regular analyses that show male and female 
employees are paid equally for equivalent work. Our pay 
policies and practices are designed to control potential 
biases and to ensure equal pay for equivalent jobs, 
regardless of gender. 

37%

At Thomas Cook, the numbers show that we have a gender 
pay gap. This gap is a result of the uneven distribution of 
men and women across the company, not because of our 
pay policies and practices. It is more pronounced in some 
sections of our business, notably the Airline, due to a lack of 
representation of women in higher-paid roles such as pilots, 
engineers and senior management.

“This report shows that we have 
much to do in the area of gender 
pay, and I am determined that 
we take meaningful action now 
to give us better balance across 
the organisation. As a customer-
focused business, we know that a 
more balanced workforce at all 
levels brings wider perspectives 
and makes decisions which 
better reflect the customers that 
we serve, ultimately helping 
us to build a more successful 
business over the long term.”

UNDERSTANDING OUR TOUR 
OPERATOR GENDER PAY GAP
The difference in gender pay is due primarily to lower-paid 
roles in our stores or as part of the IDM team which employ 
the largest proportion of female colleagues. This compares 
with the higher-paid support functions in the Thomas Cook 
UK entity which employ a larger proportion of men.

THOMAS COOK - GENDER PAY REPORTUNDERSTANDING OUR 
AIRLINE GENDER PAY 
GAP

In the UK there is a gender imbalance across the airline 
aviation industry. Women make up only 25% of graduates in 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  
In engineering and technology this figure is just 14%.  

Pilots are one of the highest-paid segments of our 
workforce. The fact that 95% of our pilots today are men 
has a big impact on our gender pay gap. We are doing all we 
can to recruit more women into these roles and rise above 
the national average. The direction of travel is encouraging; 
since 2013 we have seen a 50% increase in the number of 
active female pilots working for Thomas Cook and we have 
various initiatives in place to achieve further growth.

We see evidence of an increasingly strong female 
representation that can be seen in the mid-tier of our 
business. We have looked at the impact of various initiatives 
including apprenticeships, leadership training, mentoring 
and coaching on attracting, recruiting, developing and 
retaining the best people.  

08

“From my experience, there 
are no specific challenges that 
women face in this industry 
compared to men. Our day-to-
day duties, training, promotion 
opportunities and pay are very 
transparent and equal within 
the role of a pilot. Most of the 
challenges that surround women 
in the industry are based on 
the uptake of women coming 
into the role. I believe greater 
encouragement and awareness 
of the role is needed amongst 
younger women to show them 
how great this job can be.”
Victoria McCarthy, Thomas Cook pilot

to Gran Canaria, which included female engineers, ground 
staff, air traffic controllers, immigration, marshal and of

THOMAS COOK - GENDER PAY REPORTOUR WORK TO CLOSE THE 
GAP

We are working to address the gender pay gap across our 
business. Our Board regularly reviews our talent and the 
way diversity is reflected in the top 100 roles across the 
business. Additionally, our diversity initiatives are focused 
on all levels of staff across the business - from apprentices 
to the Executive Committee. 

While we have made progress, there is still some way to go, 
as this report shows. In the last year we have introduced a 
number of significant new initiatives to address the issues 
of gender diversity, starting at the top of the business to 
send a very clear signal of our commitment to the rest of 
organisation:

•  Introduced a range of recruitment training and 

processes to ensure  a fair and consistent selection of 
talent. This includes
•  Gender-balanced shortlists for hiring managers 
•  Gender-balanced job descriptions
•  Unconscious bias training 

•  Introduced gender diversity targets for members of our 

Executive Committee

•  Run our second Women’s sponsorship programme 
•  This programme helps support women, increase 
their confidence and open doors to connect them 
with opportunities across the Group. We had more 
people take part in the programme this year and 
incorporated a development workshop into the 
programme that was positively received. At least 50% 
of those who have taken part in the programme have 
been promoted or offered secondment opportunities 
during the time they’ve been sponsored.

•  Launched the Airline Senior Female Leadership forum
•  The Forum where we bring together females in our 
business to discuss and plan how we can support 
their development and chosen careers. 

•  Launched a partnership with FTEJerez to attract more 

female pilots through a sponsorship programme. 
•  Open to all female applicants who apply to FTEJerez 

and they can receive a €30,000 scholarship which will 
go towards their training costs

“More than two thirds of the 
workforce at Thomas Cook are 
women and I am proud of the 
huge contribution they make to 
our business. What’s clear from 
this report is that we need to do 
more to increase the number of 
women in senior positions. While 
we have made progress on this 
in recent years, there is still some 
way to go.

We are very focused on this 
issue at the highest level of the 
organisation. This is not only 
because it’s the right thing to do, 
but because we recognise that 
it will help us to build a better 
business for our colleagues 
and, most importantly, for our 
customers.”
