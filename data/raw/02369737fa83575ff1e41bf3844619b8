Introduction
The University of Bradford is well known for its 
commitment to equality, diversity and inclusivity; and for 
its friendliness and interdisciplinarity. We believe that 
a vibrant intellectual atmosphere derives from a mix of 
people from different backgrounds. 

To support our commitment the University has defined a clear agenda to promote an 
inclusive and supportive working and learning environment that is consistent with the 
university’s ethos to confront inequality and celebrate diversity. 

We have a strong commitment to bringing about positive change through 
mainstreaming equality and diversity in all core functions and promoting an inclusive 
and supportive environment for students, staff and others closely associated with the 
University. 
The University is committed to supporting the principle of equal pay for work of equal 
value and recognises that we need to continue to monitor our pay practices and the 
impact on our staff profile.

We acknowledge that there is more work to do to ensure our gender pay gap 
continues to reduce.  

The main causes for the pay gap at the University include: a) unequal representation 
of men and women in roles across the grading structure; and b) some pay disparity 
between men and women within the academic job family. 

We also identify issues particular to specific disciplines and socio-economic factors 
which impact on our gender pay gap.    

We will therefore continue to strive to ensure we understand the barriers to pay 
equality and identify innovative solutions to address these issues.

Our Action Plan
In 2016, we produced an Equal Pay Review and action plan. 
We continue to work hard to ensure we achieve our targets 
and continue to demonstrate pay equality across our 
institution including:

1. Reviewing and revising our promotion policy and procedure to ensure a fair and

equitable process which encompasses clear performance criteria and support
mechanisms to nurture all our employees and encourage personal development.

2. Developing a ‘Bradford’ framework that supports equal opportunity for career progression

by reviewing related policy and procedure including Recruitment & Selection, Induction,
Probation, Performance Development Review, Mentoring and Career Development schemes.

3. A review of the pay structure, reward and benefit mechanisms to ensure they promote

equal opportunities.

4. Continue our commitment to the voluntary Living Wage.

5. Continu  to maintain our organisational commitment to the HE sector Athena SWAN 
initiative through our steering group and in accordance with our Athena SWAN Bronze 
award action plan.

6. Continue to review our Reward policies to underpin the recommendations and action

plan for our Bi-annual equal pay review.

7.

Identify potential barriers preventing a more equal gender balance across all roles within
the University.

8. Ensure that all of our policy and procedure support equality and diversity through our

regular structured review processes.
