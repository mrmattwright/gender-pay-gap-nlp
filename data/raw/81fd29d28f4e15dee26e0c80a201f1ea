Anti-Bullying Policy  We work hard to prevent bullying and harassment, and to respond quickly and effectively if it does occur. We hold a series of events throughout the year and create and distribute promotional materials to ensure students know that bullying and harassment will not be tolerated and that they should speak to a member of staff if it happens to them or if they believe someone else is being bullied.  We are running an anti-bullying campaign which bears the slogan "Bullying...Don't stand for it, stop it!" which tells students about the special email address and phone number people can text to report bullying. If you would like to report bullying or harassment at East Riding College, email respect@eastridingcollege.ac.uk  Download our Anti-Bullying Policy   Compliments and Complaints Policy  This policy outlines the methods by which members of the community and customers can formally register their satisfaction with the service provided by the College or make a complaint.
