Pay  At Jollyes we proud to offer fair and equitable pay to all our colleagues and this is reflective in our salary structure.  Jollyes Gender Pay Compared to the UK  According to the Office of National Statistics, the UK’s current mean gender pay gap is 17.4%, while the median figure is 18.4%. The causes of a gender pay gap can be complex and there are often a number of factors that influence this such as such as working hours and the number of men and women in different roles across a business.  This is why the UK government has introduced  the requirement for all employers to publish their gender pay gap to identify differences in pay between male and female employees across our entire business regardless of job role.  This allows companies to monitor the gender pay gap so that they can understand it’s causes so that the relevant action can be taken to reduce it. Jollyes Gender Pay by Quartiles  As part of the Gender Pay Gap reporting process, employers have been asked to split their workforce into four groups based on pay, and to show the proportion of male and female employees in each quartile.    Having reviewed our results in detail we have identified that the majority of our gap is the result of having a considerably larger volume of female employees working in our lower and lower middle quartiles.                 I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate.
