Our aim is to deliver high quality services that are accessible, responsive and appropriate to meet the diverse needs of the different groups and individuals we serve and the staff we employ.  To achieve this aim, we want to ensure that service users and employees are not subject to any form of discrimination or unequal treatment.  Everyone can expect to be treated with equal respect and dignity regardless of their background or circumstances.  It is important to us that we eliminate discrimination in the way we provide our services and the way we recruit, train and support our workforce.
