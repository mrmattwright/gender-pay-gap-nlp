Read more   I would like to pass my thanks on to you all via email for the excellent customer service I received when my car was serviced recently. The customer service I experienced right from making the booking, to the collection and delivery (which was invaluable to me), notification that I needed a new tyre, receiving the health check video (which was helpful and informative), and having a nice clean car returned to me, was excellent and I could not fault it all. I would also like to say a huge 'thank you' to you for taking the time and trouble to drop off the wheel nut cover on Friday. You didn't have to do it, but you chose to and I very much appreciated it. It is a gesture such as this that makes the difference between good customer service and excellent customer service.  - Read less    A.Perry         I had a wonderful experience   I had a wonderful experience today as I bought myself a trade-in 10 plate from Kev Waite.
