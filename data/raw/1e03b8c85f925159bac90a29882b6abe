Gender Pay Gap

Introduction

Transparency in gender pay

I welcome the Government’s move to publish 
gender pay gap statistics. It provides the data 
on which to base meaningful conversations 
and drive progress. For the University of 
Hull, this report is about being honest and 
transparent, and making clear commitments 
with respect to the areas we need to progress 
to address our gender pay gap.

We strive to be a university that recognises 
talent and maximises individuals’ potential, and 
we have seen an increase in the representation 
of women in leadership positions in recent 
years. However, the gender pay gap report 
reveals that we have more work to do.

Unfortunately, the University is representative 
of society – where a higher proportion of 
women are employed in lower-band roles and 
a higher proportion of men are employed in 
higher-band roles. Our gender pay gap reflects 
this situation. Indeed, it is important to be 
aware that the gender pay gap reveals the 
difference in the average pay between all men 
and women in a workforce. Thus, the gaps 
highlighted in this report are not the result of 
unequal pay for women. We undertake regular 
equal pay reviews and are fully compliant in 
this area.

We must work to address our gender pay gap. 
Our focus must be on increasing the number 
of women in higher-paid roles through a 
variety of mechanisms that support both the 
recruitment of new staff and the development 
of our current staff. We must also look to 
attract men into those roles that are currently 
held predominantly by women. We must also 
review access to part-time working across all 
pay bands and continue to explore areas for 
improvement – so that all colleagues are able 
to reach their full potential, taking account of 

their personal circumstances. Further, we must 
embed good practice across the institution. 
To drive forward with this work, we have 
established a pay parity group which will 
regularly report to the University Leadership 
Team on progress against key priorities.

The positive benefits of a diverse and inclusive 
workforce are well established. We must 
continue to work hard to achieve such a 
workforce. Addressing the gender pay gap is 
one part of this, and the University Leadership 
Team and I are fully committed to improving 
our performance in this regard.

Gender pay gap report

What is the gender pay gap?
Legislation introduced in April 2017 requires all 
employers of 250 or more employees to publish 
their gender pay gap for workers in scope as at 31 
March 2017.

The gender pay gap provides a snapshot of the 
gender pay balance at the University, measuring 
the difference between the average earnings of all 
male and female employees, irrespective of their role. 
The gender pay gap is expressed as the percentage 
difference between the average pay of male 
employees and female employees.

The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. Equal 
pay records whether men and women in the same 
workplace receive equal pay for carrying out work 
of equal value. The University uses Higher Education 
Role Analysis (HERA), which forms part of the 2004 
framework agreement for the modernisation of pay 
structures to analyse pay differentials. The University 
undertakes regular equal pay reviews, and the 
most recent review (in 2017) demonstrates that the 
University is fully compliant with requirements around 
equal pay. Therefore, gender pay gaps highlighted in 
this report are not a result of unequal pay for women.

Bonus pay
The University of Hull does not award bonus pay to its 
employees. Clinical Excellence Awards are awarded by 
the NHS to some of the University’s clinical academic 
staff and are subsequently paid by the University to 
those staff who qualify for this award. These awards 
are identified as bonus pay in the context of the 
gender pay gap and have therefore been included in 
the report. On 31 March 2017, nine staff members were 
in receipt of a Clinical Excellence Award, and one of 
those staff members was female.

What is causing the gender pay gap?
Gender pay gap analysis covers all levels of work 
across a wide range of employment contracts and 
roles. The gender pay gap is complex because 
of the way organisations, such as universities, are 
structured and organised. Analysis shows that the 
gender pay gap at the University of Hull is driven by 
the structure of the workforce with concentrations of 
men and women clustered at different levels within 
the organisation. As an example, 53.78% of University 
staff included in the gender pay gap report are 
women. However, 72.67% of staff in the lower quartile 
are women, whereas 60.21% of staff in the upper 
quartile are men. This illustrates the fact that the 
gender pay gap is largely a result of a much higher 
number of women in the lower quartile undertaking 
lower paid work.

Our data

•  The gender pay gap is a measure that 

shows the difference in the average (mean 
or median) pay and bonuses of all men and 
all women – regardless of the nature of their 
work – across an entire organisation.  

•  The gender pay gap should not be confused 

with unequal pay. Equal pay comparison 
would involve a direct comparison of two 
people or groups of people carrying out the 
same, similar or equivalent work. 

•  There are more women than men in our 

lower-band roles and fewer women in higher-
band roles: this is the main reason for our 
gender pay gap.

MEAN AND MEDIAN

•  The gender pay gap shows the difference 
between the mean (average) and median 
(mid-point) pay and bonus earnings of male 
and female employees, expressed as a 
percentage of male employees’ earnings.

•  The mean gender pay gap shows the 

difference in the average hourly pay for all 
women compared to all men, regardless 
of the nature of their work within the 
organisation.

•  The median represents the middle point 

of a population. If you separately lined 
up all the women and all the men in the 
organisation in order of lowest hourly  
rate of pay to highest, the median pay gap 
is the difference in pay between the middle 
woman compared to that of the middle 
man.

•  The mean and median are affected by the 

different numbers of men and women in 
different roles.

How the University of Hull  
is working to close the gap

As part of the plan to reduce our gender pay gap, the University has identified 
three priorities.

 
1. 

 Increase the number of women employed in roles within our 
 highest pay bands.

 
 2.  
 

 
3.  

 Ensure jobs at our lower pay bands are attractive and 
 accessible to men as well as women.
 Review access to part-time working across all  
 pay bands.

To make progress against these priorities, we will

• 

•  establish a pay parity group that meets regularly, 

recommends activities designed to reduce the 
gender pay gap and monitors the impact, and 
reports to the University Leadership Team on 
progress; 

review recruitment adverts to counter 
unconscious gender-bias language in job 
descriptions and recruitment materials;

•  provide career development programmes for 
staff to address gender imbalance in identified 
areas of work;

•  continuously monitor the application of pay 

•  strengthen the University’s mentoring networks 

policies through the Pay Parity Group to ensure 
equality in pay decisions, to understand the 
impact of those decisions on the gender pay gap 
and to report any causes for concern; 

• 

investigate gender distribution of men and 
women in specific roles, including role design and 
recruitment practices used to attract and appoint 
into these roles;

•  monitor the application of recruitment and 

promotion processes for consistency to ensure 
greater transparency around how we recruit, 
develop and promote our staff – ensuring 
opportunity and progression for all;

to improve participation and consistency in 
development opportunities and initiatives;

review the workload allocation framework 
for consistency – to understand if and where 
disadvantages to career progression may exist 
and to address any issues identified;

investigate the effectiveness and consistency of 
flexible working practices and female return rates 
following family leave;

• 

• 

•  continue our commitment to supporting and 

developing the Athena SWAN initiative at 
institutional and school level.
