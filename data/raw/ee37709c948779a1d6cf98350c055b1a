We have prepared our first Gender Pay Gap report to comply with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, which shows:  The mean Gender Pay Gap is:		-9.67% The above results show that the average pay is in favour of female employees who are on average paid 9.67% above the average male employee.   The median Gender Pay Gap is:			0.17% The above results show that the median pay of male employees was 0.17% above the median of female employees.   The mean Gender Bonus Gap is:			69.27% The median Gender Bonus Gap is:			43.83%   The proportion of males receiving a bonus is 5.47% and the proportion of females receiving a bonus is 13.33%  Although the above bonus results show a disparity in the mean and median bonuses paid to male employees relative to those paid to female employees, this is due to the positions that are eligible for annual bonus payments and the External Sales teams being occupied predominantly by males.  In 2018 the eligibility for inclusion in the annual bonus plan is to be extended further which will address this differential.
