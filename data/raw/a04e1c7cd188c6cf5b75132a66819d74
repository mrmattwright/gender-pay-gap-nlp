Joint working  South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse district councils have been working together since 2005. Mark Stone was appointed as joint chief executive in 2017.  The two councils have integrated services, however each still retains its own distinctive identity and, in certain key areas, offer different levels of service to their residents reflecting both corporate priorities and different financial bases.  The councils employ around 400 staff. This is a low number for district councils, particularly taking into account the size and population of the districts. We work with contractors to deliver some services.  We are proud to be an equal opportunities employer and our annual gender pay gap report 2017/18 (58.2 KB)    is illustrative of this. The councils understand the importance of work-life balance and offer flexible working, annualised hours and support staff training and development.  Find out more about the senior management board and the councils' departments .  Vision and Values  The vision and values are important to the councils and we expect staff to support them and embed them in the way they work.  Our Vision  We are seen as being customer focused, approachable and business-like. We are honest and open and are renowned for providing high quality-cost effective services.  Our Values   We act with integrity and show respect  We are all accountable  We are passionate about our business  We strive for simplicity  We love success      Last reviewed: 03 - 04 - 2018    Was this page helpful?
