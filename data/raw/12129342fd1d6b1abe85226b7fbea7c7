The Council uses information and data when formulating service delivery and policy to in order to ensure that we understand how people of different groups (or protected characteristics) may be impacted.  In addition, under the Equality Act 2010, all public authorities have both general and specific duties. Public authorities covered by the specific duties of the Act, like Blaby District Council, must publish information by to demonstrate their compliance with the general duty. This includes information relating to people who share a relevant protected characteristic who are:   Its employees (for authorities with more than 150 staff).  People affected by its policies and practices (for example service users).   More information can be found through the Equality and Human Right Commission Equalities Act 2010 (external link) web page, and Equalities Act Easy Read Document (external link).  Gender Pay Gap   We are required by law to carry out gender pay reporting and this involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation. We can use these results to assess and the levels of gender equality in our workplace and the balance of male and female employees at different levels  It is important to note that gender pay reporting is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. Our most recent results can be found in the Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 .   Religion, Belief and Diversity  The Interfaith Forum for Leicestershire brings together representatives from Faith communities (along with other interested individuals and professionals) from across the county.  More information about the Forum and to access the Interfaith and International Calendar 2016, which has been developed to offer a month by month introduction to key faith, national and international events to go the Leicestershire County Council's Religion and belief website page (external link).  Employee Data  The Council currently employees 303 members of staff. An equality profile of staff helps us to understand key issues about the workforce. We also use this data to inform decisions and policies affecting employees. We will continue to work to ensure that this data is comprehensive and this will be updated as more becomes available. An equality profile of our employees can be found in the Annual Report .  About our District  A profile of the population characteristics of the District helps us to understand key issues facing the community. We use a variety of sources including the 2011 census and data from the Office of National Statistics.  Some of the information we use includes:   The district covers an area of 13,000 hectares to the south west of Leicester, and has a population of 94,600 people.  In Blaby, 88.5% residents  were White British and 11.5% were from Minority Ethnic Groups.  The district has low levels of deprivation and relatively low levels of unemployment.  Nearly 16% of people aged 16- 64 both work-limiting disabled and disabled.    Blaby District Profile  We use this data to inform decisions and policies that we make to assess the impact on different groups of people and to examine customer needs. In order to do this we have developed an Equality Impact Needs Assessment (EINA) process for both new and existing services and policies. An EINA will be carried out on new service policies as they are developed and over time on existing ones.  Other sources of information and research include:   2011 Census Release of population and household estimates   LSROnline (external link)   Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (external link)   'Places in Blaby' Report   A Life Stage Approach - Equality Mapping (external link)   2011 Census Population Data - Sources: Office of National Statistics (ONS) 2012  Customer and Residents Consultation  We are committed to engaging and consulting with our local communities, wherever appropriate, with regards to our plans, strategies and policies. We welcome feedback and comments from people regardless of their age, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation. Details of future consultations will be available on our home page as they take place.  Every 2 years the Council carries out a general survey with residents of the district.  A survey carried out with the residents of Blaby district in November and December 2015 has shown a positive and satisfied community within the district.  The survey resulted in 1138 responses.  2015 Residents Survey Summary  Blaby Residents Survey 2015 full report  We also under take various other survey and consultations including service specific satisfaction surveys.
