Johnstons of Elgin operate a strict policy of employment on merit.  All appointments are now monitored to avoid 
discrimination on grounds of gender, religion or race.  Approximately two thirds of our overall workforce are 
female.   

Whilst we do offer equal opportunities, there has been a tendency for particular jobs to attract mostly female 
candidates, whilst others attract mostly male candidates.  This is breaking down in some areas, such as weaving, 
which is no longer characterised by a male workforce.  In other areas the tendency of females towards hand skills 
and males towards machine operation is taking longer to break down.   

In three of the last four years we have promoted more females than males into management roles.   We also have 
two female members of our company board.   We do expect this trend to continue, along with a gradual 
breakdown of gender preferences for specific departments or roles.   

We will continue to monitor appointments closely, along with our overall pay gap, to ensure that our actions are 
effective in ensuring that men and women are treated equally in our workforce and there is equal opportunity for 
all.
