Background 
The Red Maids' School and Redland High School merged in 2016 to form Redmaids' High 
School, bringing together 500 years of distinguished history and expertise in single-sex 
education for girls. 
 
Gender pay gap reporting requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish statutory 
calculations every year showing the pay gap between male and female employees. 
Redmaids' High School temporarily had more than 250 employees in April 2017, due to the 
merger, but will be under the threshold in April 2018. 
 
For Redmaids' High School, please see the calculations below: 
 
Women's hourly rate is: 
5% HIGHER (mean) 
10% HIGHER (median) 
 
Pay Quartiles

employees in each of four pay bands, where Lower Quartile represents lowest salaries and
