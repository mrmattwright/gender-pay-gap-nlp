There’s plenty more where this came from…Well maybe not quite as heart-warming but it will certainly will give you a flavour of the AKW Global Logistics stance on: progression, development, support and opportunity. Have a read of R’ Shaun’s story…  Shaun joined AKW Global Logistics Ltd back in 1997, full of enthusiasm despite AKW being his 13th interview after previous failed attempts due to lack of experience. Fresh faced, eager and impressionable, his attitude impressed, leading him across the school gates and into the organisation on a Modern Apprenticeship programme. Speaking of the interview process, Shaun comments ‘I was grateful somebody finally had some faith in me and was prepared to offer me the opportunity’.  By the strike of the millennium, Shaun had quickly progressed into the position of Accounts Assistant. Thriving in the volatile environment, Shaun recalls recognising early ‘the unpredictable nature of warehousing’ and after four years in accounts, was torn between remaining in his current position v’s getting involved in the fast paced world of operations. Shaun’s desire for fresh challenges won, and in 2004 he progressed into an Account Handler position; ‘It was the challenge of dealing with something different every day in the warehouse environment that enticed me out of accounts’  Load More Content Describing this new position as a right of passage experience, Shaun’s natural aptitude for learning really began to shine, with him becoming ‘a self-taught super-user of the Stock Management System’, catapulting him into a promotion to Senior Stock Controller within the year.  Being his first senior position, Shaun relied on abundant mentorship from the Warehouse Manager and the Chair of the Company – Tony Worthington, himself. This enhanced Shaun’s innate leadership skills, prompting the company to further invest in his potential by enrolling him on a formal management training programme. Shaun explained this as an enlightened moment where he first spotted the correlation between effective people management and business performance, saying it ‘really opened my eyes to the tools and techniques in management that can impact the performance of operations and ultimately the bottom line’.  As staff levels increased in line with customer demand, Shaun was again promoted to Administration Manager, and informally became the Warehouse Manager’s right hand man. This two year stint allowed him to put the theory of his managerial training into practice, by ‘dealing with challenging staff’ whilst also managing a turbulent time in the warehouse integrating new systems. When a second warehousing location was unveiled, it was only natural that Shaun was seconded to the position of Warehouse Manager. With the skills he had accrued, he was able to ensure the new site ‘mirrored the quality and operational knowledge’ of the existing site.  Shaun soon became the Warehouse Manager of both sites, commenting that ‘further management training was also offered and that still does serve me well’, proving that empowering talented employees through training doesn’t go unnoticed and really does pay dividends.  Now at the peak of his career, Shaun is the Systems & Compliance Manager, as this is where his strengths lie. With a little belief from AKW, Shaun has become invaluable asset to the business, undertaking a role with huge responsibilities. What Shaun lacked in experience he built with determination, drive and dedication, climbing the ranks and massively improving results in collaboration with the Warehousing Director.  We have always valued the importance of nurturing the next generation of talented people to ensure the company remains in a strong position for the future.  Tony Worthington Chairman and Founder I’ve been with AKW Global Logistics Ltd for 10 years now, starting out as a Night Shift Supervisor and working my way up to Warehouse Manager. AKW have supported me through several training courses over the years in health and safety and auditing and this has helped me resolve day to day issues more effectively. I enjoy the different challenges an ever changing customer base brings to my working day and I hope to continue to progress to Senior Management in the next few years.  Dave Nettleton Warehouse Manager, Manchester I joined AKW Global Logistics Ltd as an eager Sales Executive back in 2011. After 6 years of loyalty, commitment and extremely hard work to exceed the sales targets I had been set, I received a promotion to Sales Manager.  This development opportunity has really boosted my intrinsic motivation and I am determined to continue to win business for the company, with my focus on captivating large, corporate accounts.  AKW Global Logistics Ltd is an emerging, unique and ambitious company and has given me a rewarding and fulfilling working day for the past 6 years (and hopefully many more to come).  My advice to anyone thinking about where to start, develop or change their career path is to consider an opportunity in the logistics industry – there is a lot more to it than meets the eye and if I could do it all again I would!  Rob Spencer Sales Manager, Manchester I started at AKW Global Logistics Ltd in 2015 as Transport Operative. I have since had exposure to all parts of the transport operation and I am currently a Management Trainee.  My training and development has predominantly been delivered through hands-on learning and it has been exactly how transport is - quick, ever changing, fluid and intense! I have stepped into the Transport Manager’s shoes many a times when he has been on holiday, which has been a great opportunity for me to learn new things. It has also provided me with invaluable experience, gained from the level of responsibility involved.  My hands-on training and development at AKW Global Logistics Ltd has been tailored to my learning style preference, which is the best way I could have learnt in my opinion. This is because I have had to work things out for myself and make decisions based on what is actually happening in the operation, as opposed to what a text book tells me. I find more formal, classroom-type learning can be generalised and not necessarily applicable to the specific operation of the individual business.  Being thrown in the deep end and getting stuck straight in has been much more beneficial for my development.  George Richards Management Trainee, Manchester In 2010 I joined AKW Global Logistics Ltd as a Transport Clerk. Since then I have progressed to Administration Assistant and again to Accounts Assistant, each time receiving more responsibility.  I am currently doing my Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) Level 3 qualification at Trafford College, which is fully supported by AKW. I’m planning to do my AAT Level 6 if the opportunity arises in the not so distant future, so that I can further develop my accountancy skills and carry on learning.  AKW Global Logistics Ltd has provided me with personal development and the training and development opportunities I have been given have given me the skills and confidence I needed to be able to perform to the best of my ability. There is a real team spirit here and I can always rely on someone from my team to help and support me when I need it.  Magdalena Dabrowska Accounts Assistant, Manchester I started at AWK Global Logistics Ltd in 2011 as a Line Leader on the production line in the Warehouse. A few months later I was given the opportunity to join the support team in the Office in an Administration role. It was during this role that I undertook some internal Management training and I am now the Customer Service Manager. I am currently doing a Level 3 Business Administration course which has helped me identify my weaknesses and find ways to improve them. AKW have really given me the opportunity to grow and develop in my career aspirations. I can honestly say I enjoy every single day here – it is really dynamic and the people make a really great team!  Agnieszka Ciolek Customer Service Manager, Manchester I have worked at AKW Global Logistics Ltd as an International Traffic Planner since 2012. During this time, I have been supported in obtaining my BTEC Intermediate Award in Multimodal International Freight Procedures. Although I was the only female on the course, I really enjoyed it and it provided me with useful information to apply in my daily work tasks, to enable me to build a strong working relationship with my customers. AKW fully supported this training and development. I enjoy the diverse range of challenges I am faced with at AKW – no one day is the same. I also have the opportunity to step into the International Freight Manager’s shoes when she is not here and I thrive off the challenge this gives me – this is definitely where I want to progress to.  Emma Ranson International Traffic Planner, Manchester I joined AKW Global Logistics Ltd back in 2009 as a Team Leader (for 2 weeks, before I was made Production Supervisor!) I have since had several different roles here and am currently the Contract Packing Manager. I am currently doing my NVQ Management Level 5 which is fully supported by AKW. This has built my confidence and enabled me to effectively manage my team. It is something which I am encouraging my team members to complete, so that when I am ready for my next step, there is a succession plan in place! Being given the opportunity to complete my NVQ Management Level 5 has also given me some more motivation, as my passion is to keep learning and progressing within the company. The thing I enjoy most about working for AKW Global Logistics Ltd is the autonomy I have in my role – Senior Management trust me to make my own decisions which I much prefer to my previous role in a larger company with lots of set policies and procedures to follow.  Andon Bozhkov Contract Packing Manager, Manchester Who we really are AKW is a modern forward thinking business, that tells it like it is! There is little room for corporate stuffiness in our world, so we have embraced our city dwelling heritage and made our business: open, welcoming and refreshingly straight forward.  Apprenticeships The Logistics industry plays a crucial role in the economy, but it is under threat due to a large shortage of Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers. One reason for this shortage of Drivers is demographics, with the average age of Drivers being 53 and 13% being over 60 (HRmagazine, 2014). There are only 2% under the age of 25, meaning a large proportion of Drivers are approaching retirement age and there are not enough younger people with the skills to be able to step into their shoes. Having an ageing workforce and not attracting a younger demographic poses major problems for us in the not so distant future. We are therefore actively working towards overcoming this potential problem by exploring offering a range of apprenticeships throughout our operation, focusing on Drivers but also looking into the Warehousing and Office Support functions.  These apprenticeships will be predominantly aimed at younger people in a bid to create an opportunity for younger people to aspire to work in, as opposed to just ‘falling into it’ which is quite common in our industry. We want to utilise our long-serving employees who have a wealth of knowledge and experience, as mentors and coaches for this next generation of staff. This is a crucial element of our succession planning to ensure there are no skills-gaps when our older generation come to leave us, meaning the operation continues to run smoothly.
