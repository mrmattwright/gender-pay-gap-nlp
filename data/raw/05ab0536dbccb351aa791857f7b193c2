PAY GAP REPORT 2017

AJW recognises the importance of people at work
and one of our four key business objectives is to
enable and support our people to make a diﬀerence
through collaboration, accountability and trust.

To support this objective, equal and fair treatment of
all employees across the globe is paramount and we
are committed to ongoing investment in diversity and
inclusion activity.

Our results indicate that we do have a gender pay
gap. However, we are conﬁdent that women and 
men are paid the same for doing the same job. 
In order to reduce the gender pay gap our eﬀorts 
are mainly focussed on improving our overall 
gender balance at our company.

PAY GAP REPORT 2017

We have taken a deeper look at where this 
imbalance is most signiﬁcant and we found that;

49% of roles we have 

33% of our roles are 
logistics but only 7%

based in warehousing and

of these roles are 

classiﬁed to be directly or 
indirectly related to STEM 

careers** and 35%

of these roles are 

undertaken by women.

However, within our business
support areas which make up

the remaining 18% we 

can report a slightly diﬀerent

picture with 63%

undertaken by women.

undertaken by women.

This demonstrates that some areas of our business 
needs to change more than others to become more
attractive to women.  

We are committed to the attraction, promotion and
retention of more women. However, we have decided 
not to introduce quotas or targets at this stage instead 
we will monitor representation ﬁgures and activities 
aimed at reducing bias and track our progress.  

We have successfully introduced new processes aimed 
at reducing bias. For example when shortlisting CV’s we
remove any reference to gender, we utilise behavioural
assessments and mixed recruitment panels in our decision
making process. A further part of this will be challenging
the requirement for aviation and technical experience
which we know is a male dominated talent pool.

President and Chief Executive Oﬃcer 
AJW Group

We are aspiring to improve work life balance by increasing
ﬂexible working and a results based view throughout the
company; to provide unconscious bias and cross cultural
training to help foster an inclusive culture.  

To support this initiative we will introduce a mixed gender
steering group to monitor and develop further initiatives
to ensure our progress.

I conﬁrm the gender pay gap data contained in this report
is accurate and has been produced in accordance with
the guidance on managing gender pay 
developed by the ACAS.

**When hiring employees we have previously considered 
technical and or aviation experience an advantage in these areas.
