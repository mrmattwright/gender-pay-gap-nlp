We work in around 120 countries, including in some of the most complex and challenging contexts. Our global ambition is to ensure all children survive past their fifth birthday; have access to a quality basic education; and are protected from all forms of violence. Last year we helped change the lives of more than 55 million children directly around the world, through ours and our partners' work.  Save the Children International is committed to having a diverse and inclusive workforce where everyone is valued equally and all employees feel respected. Our approach to reward and pay aims to be competitive and fair. We have a global workforce of approximately 16,000, and more than 250 staff who are employed by the UK office. Save the Children International’s UK staff are included in the reporting below. The figures do not include employees of Save the Children UK, who have reported on gender pay separately.   What is gender pay?  A gender pay gap is identified when comparing the overall average pay of male and female staff regardless of their roles or seniority. This is different from equal pay, which focuses on the pay differences between men and women performing the same or similar work. A gender pay gap can result from a number of factors including differences in the sorts of jobs typically performed by men and women.  Save the Children International has identified a median gender pay gap of 12.3% and a mean gender pay gap of 18.8%. There are a number of factors for this, but we believe ours is, in part, because there are not enough women in senior roles. Globally, we have seen an increase of gender diversity in our leadership positions, but it is not yet completely equitable. In 2017, for instance, women held 54% of our country office leadership positions, but less in middle management positions. We are committed to doing whatever we can to address this issue.  What is Save the Children International doing about its pay gap?  Save the Children is committed to helping women to progress into leadership roles. This aim will be driven by our performance management approach and Save the Children International’s global leadership’s ongoing commitment to identify and develop talented female leaders.  Furthermore, in 2017, we refreshed our recruitment and reward policies and practices to ensure decisions around pay and recruitment were gender blind. We have also previously conducted an equal pay audit, which we will continue moving forward. We will continue to make improvements to address this gap in 2018, including ensuring our jobs advertisements have gender-neutral language and that we recruit through a variety of channels, consider non-traditional sources, inviting wider groups of people to apply and have gender balanced recruitment panels. Our new online talent management approach will check for gender bias and we will introduce gender bias training in leadership training. We are also proud to offer topped up maternity pay and options for shared parental leave. As part of building an inclusive workplace, we also help new parents return to work by making flexible working arrangements, where possible.  Transparency is a key priority for Save the Children International. We believe that reporting on our pay and reward is an important process.  This information will allow organisations, like ours, to better understand the effectiveness of current practices. More importantly, it empowers us to address it. We are committed to making Save the Children International a diverse and inclusive workplace. We believe diversity and inclusiveness is vital to our ability to achieve our ambition for children – and our ambition is too important not to be achieved!
