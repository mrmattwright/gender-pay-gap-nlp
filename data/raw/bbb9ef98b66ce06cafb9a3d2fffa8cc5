This is the difference between the gross hourly earnings for all men and the gross hourly earnings for all women. The data represents the position at 5 April 2017.  Is it about equal pay?  It is different from equal pay. Equal pay is about men and women being paid the same for the same work, or work of equal value. LSM UK believes we do not have an equal pay issue.  How is it measured?  The mean gender pay gap shows the difference between the average pay of all LSM UK male employees and female employees;  The median gender pay gap shows the pay difference between the middle point of LSM UK male employees and female employees  LSM Gender pay numbers  Based on information relating to employees working in its London headquarters on 5 April 2017, the data shows the following for LSM:      Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile   LSM’s President and Managing Director, Matthew Moore said: “Solving gender balance issues is not something that can be achieved overnight, however our management team is committed to take the action necessary to close the gap – not just in the UK, but across our operations in Europe and the rest of the world.  “The fact is men constitute a greater proportion of our management team than women. This is a situation we intend to change through a range of initiatives we’ve put in place.”  He outlines a range of actions LSM has committed to in order to bring about change.  Actions already taken:   Launched diversity and inclusion initiative in 2017, which focuses on the unique perspectives of our people, including participation in range of City-wide gender-related networks and training of dedicated D&I ‘champions’ to challenge bias  Trained all senior executives and line managers to recognise and disrupt their unconscious bias  Recruited a dedicated talent manager to develop a strategy for developing all of our people’s careers, which will include gender balance  Asked LSM’s recruitment agencies to provide a better gender balance among potential recruits   Future actions to be taken:   The Senior Leadership Team will be accountable for implementing Inclusive Hiring & Appointments This will include all of our hiring managers attending training. We will initiate an Internal Appointment process requiring applicants for senior roles to be interviewed by a gender-diverse panel of trained hiring managers. Our talent strategy will include gender balance, and ensure fair access to roles and opportunities for internal candidates  Improve our People Policies to help everyone achieve balance between work, family and other commitments. This will be helped by our Flexible Working Policy, implementing Smart Working, and by reviewing our family care policies such as Shared Parental leave  Develop a longer-term Diversity & Inclusion Policy and Strategy. This will include initiatives on development, the workplace environment, customer & community engagement, and talent. Gender balance at all levels will be one of the key focus areas in this strategy   Declaration  I confirm that the data contained within this report is accurate and meets the gender Pay Gap Reporting regulations  Matthew Moore, President and Managing Director Liberty Specialty Markets  Diversity and inclusion at LSM  We firmly believe that diversity is critical for our future success. Becoming a high performing financial services company in a rapidly-changing world requires us to approach things differently. A diverse workforce will approach things differently and is a business imperative for ongoing success. Diversity can only happen if we are inclusive of all differences – visible and invisible. Gender is part of that diversity.
