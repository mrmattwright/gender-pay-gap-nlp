Our policies and procedures are reviewed regularly, and our line managers are kept up to date with changes to employment legislation. Our policies are applied fairly and consistently with the aim of making the Group an employer of choice, which maintains a good relationship with its employees and encourages them to balance work requirements with family and social needs.

Management development programmes are run for all individuals new to management roles, and we actively encourage and sponsor individuals to develop themselves through further education programmes. Throughout this process we try to ensure that our people fulfill their potential to the benefit of both the individual and the Group.
