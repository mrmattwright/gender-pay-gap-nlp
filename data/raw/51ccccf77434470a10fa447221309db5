The nine protected characteristics are:  Age – not including under-18s  Disability   Gender reassignment – including people who have proposed, started or completed a process to change their sex but who are not under medical supervision  Marriage/civil partnership – not including those who are not married/in a civil partnership  Pregnancy and maternity – defined as all stages of pregnancy and the 26 week period following the birth of a child  Race - including caste, nationality, ethnicity, skin colour  Religion or belief – including atheism or agnosticism  Sex - a man or a woman  Sexual orientation    The Equality Act (2010) consolidates and replaces all previous equalities legislation such as the Race Relations Act, Disability Discrimination Act and Sex Discrimination Act.  The Public Sector Equality Duty places additional duties on public sector organisations such as multi academy trusts.
