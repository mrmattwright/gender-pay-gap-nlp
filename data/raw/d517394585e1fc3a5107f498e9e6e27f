Understanding our Pay Gap 
 
The above figures show we are significantly lower than the UK average of 18% stated by the 
Office of National Statistics. 
 
All hourly paid staff are paid the same hourly rate regardless of their gender. 
 
Salaries are awarded within a pay range for the role, depending on skills, experience, 
qualifications and length of service. Gender is irrelevant to our decisions on pay. 
 
Bonus qualification is applied equally to males and females based on gender neutral criteria. 
 
 
Closing the Gender Pay Gap 
 
Through our ‘How We Do Business’ model, one of our values is ‘Growing Together’; supporting 
and encouraging each other whilst embracing and respecting our differences and diversity. 
 
We are continuously working on our apprenticeship, graduate and management & leadership 
training and development, offering equal opportunities for all. 
 
We continue to evolve our standard working arrangements and shift patterns to increase 
flexibility to all staff, whist continuing to work on defining the work levels and grades across the 
whole business. 
 
We pay our people more than the national living wage, regardless of gender. We offer better 
rewards for current and prospective employees to retain and attract top industry talent, 
regardless of gender.  
 
 
 
I confirm that the data provided is accurate and meets the statutory requirements for Gender 
Pay reporting.
