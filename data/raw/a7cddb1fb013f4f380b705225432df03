Chairman’s Statement

The Group’s 2020 Strategy is well established 
with good momentum and considerable 
further benefits to come

The Group’s core values of leadership, 
excellence, trust and sustainability 
underpin our culture along with our key 
objective of doing business responsibly.”

Summary
 • 2017 has been another year of good profit growth.

 • Core values remain leadership, excellence, 

trust and sustainability.

 • 14% increase in earnings per share reflecting 

continuing strength of the Marshalls brand.

 • Strong balance sheet and prudent capital structure.

 • Full-year dividend of 10.20 pence (up 17%) 

and a discretionary supplementary 
dividend of 4.00 pence.

Overview
This is my last report to you as your Chairman and I am pleased to 
be leaving your Company in good shape, with 2017 having been 
another year of profitable growth. Cash performance has been strong 
and we are again able to propose an increased dividend and a further 
supplementary dividend, whilst continuing to invest in the business 
and maintain a prudent capital structure. The Group’s 2020 Strategy 
is well established with good momentum and considerable further 
benefits to come. The acquisition of CPM Group Limited (“CPM”) during 
the year was an important step forward. Doing business the right way 
has always been important to Marshalls as we seek to ensure we 
balance the interests of all our stakeholders and make a full and proper 
contribution to society.

Contribution to Society
Marshalls is purpose led. Our products transform the built environment 
whether public spaces or private driveways and patios through strong 
aesthetics and fit for purpose. We target very high levels of customer 
service. New product development and digital are important elements 
of our strategy and we continue to invest strongly in the business. 
We employ over 2,600 people, many of whom have been with 
Marshalls for very long periods. We are a “Living Wage“ company and 
our pay is positioned at the top end for the industry. We established a 

new improved defined contribution pension scheme for employees 
during the year with a larger pension contribution made by the 
Company. We encourage share ownership and sharing in success, 
and we place a high priority on employee engagement, training and 
development, building successful careers for our people, and health and 
safety. Many of our businesses and our people play a strong role in their 
local communities. In 2017 over £50,000 was raised by employees for 
MIND which was the Group’s chosen national charity and the Company 
has matched this contribution. As you will see from this report the Board 
is committed to the highest standards of environmental, sustainability 
and governance practice. The Group has maintained its “Fair Tax Mark“ 
status in 2017. Taking account not only of corporation tax but also of 
PAYE and NI paid on our employee wages, aggregates levy, VAT, fuel 
duty and business rates Marshalls has funded total taxation to the UK 
economy of £96 million, some 22 per cent of Group turnover.

Results and dividends
Group revenue for the year was £430.2 million, an increase of 8 per cent 
on 2016. Excluding the contribution from CPM, like-for-like revenue was 
up 6 per cent. The Domestic end market performance was again strong 
with revenue growth of 12 per cent during the year.

Profit before tax of £52.1 million (2016: £46.0 million) is stated after 
charging £1.2 million of operational restructuring costs and £0.8 million 
of acquisition costs. EBITDA has grown by 12 per cent to £67.9 million 
and the Group’s earnings per share, at 21.52 pence, is up 14 per cent.

STRATEGIC REPORTThe Board’s priorities for 2017 included the continuing promotion 
of the 2020 Strategy, the development of Marshalls’ corporate culture 
and good practice, and succession planning, both at Board and senior 
management level. These initiatives are explained in more detail in the 
Corporate Governance Statement on pages 36 to 41.

During 2017, an internal evaluation of Board performance was 
undertaken to follow the external evaluation in 2016. No areas 
of material concern were highlighted during the 2017 evaluation.

Board changes
Mark Edwards retired from the Board following the Annual General 
Meeting in May 2017 having served as Non-Executive Director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee since May 2010. Following Mark’s 
retirement Graham Prothero was appointed Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of the Audit Committee. Graham has a strong financial 
background with significant sector experience.

In October 2017, I announced my intention to step down as Chairman 
and retire from the Board after nearly 8 years as your Chairman and 15 
years as a Non-Executive Director. I will step down immediately after the 
AGM when my successor will take over. 

People
During my time at Marshalls I have visited our operations on numerous 
occasions and have met and talked to large numbers of our people 
across the organisation. It is clear to me that our people are the 
enduring strength of the business. There is a real passion for what 
we do and a high level of decency that pervades everything. 

I would like to thank all our staff for their commitment, hard work 
and continuing dedication to Marshalls and also for their considerable 
support to me.

Outlook
The Group has again delivered strong profit growth year-on-year. 
Good progress has been made in the year executing the 2020 Strategy, 
notably the acquisition of CPM, and the ongoing self help programme 
to drive organic growth is progressing well. The underlying drivers have 
remained positive in our main end markets and our sales and order 
intake have been strong in the first 2 months of 2018.

We remain well placed to deliver continued growth and operational 
profit improvements.

Andrew Allner
Chairman

Marshalls continues to have strong cash generation with year-end 
net debt of £24.3 million (2016: £5.4 million net cash), after funding 
the acquisition of CPM of £41.2 million. 

The Group’s policy is to pay a progressive dividend aimed at achieving 
up to 2 times cover over the business cycle. The Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 6.80 pence per share (2016: 5.80 pence per share) 
which, together with the interim dividend of 3.40 pence per share 
(2016: 2.90 pence per share), makes a combined dividend of 10.20 
pence per share (2016: 8.70 pence per share), an increase of 17 per cent 
for the year.

The Board is also recommending a supplementary dividend 
of 4.00 pence per share for 2017 (2016: 3.00 pence per share). 
This supplementary dividend is discretionary. The payment of a 
supplementary dividend recognises the Board’s objective of maintaining 
an efficient and prudent capital structure and providing increased 
returns for shareholders whilst at the same time retaining flexibility 
for capital and other investment opportunities.

Strategy
Our vision is to establish Marshalls as a world-class hard landscape 
business and to grow our emerging businesses. The Group’s strategic 
objective is to deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value whilst 
taking into consideration the interests of all our stakeholders and the 
wider contribution we make to society. The Group’s 2020 Strategy is 
firmly aligned with this vision and our strategy is already focused on 
sustaining the delivery of our core objectives beyond this time horizon.

The Marshalls brand remains central to our strategy and we have again 
received “Superbrand“ status for 2018. Our emphasis on customer 
service, the provision of new and innovative quality products and 
integrated solutions, the development of our digital strategy, and focus 
on those areas of the market with good growth potential all underpin 
the continuing development of the Marshalls brand.

Culture
The Board fosters an open and transparent culture that is responsive 
to the expectations of stakeholders and the external environment. 
Corporate culture remains a priority and the Board is working with the 
help of external consultants to define clearly its vision of good company 
culture and to embed this successfully into its operations in 2018.

The Group’s core values of leadership, excellence, trust and sustainability 
underpin our culture along with our key objective of doing business 
responsibly. The aim is to promote sustainable operations, minimise 
adverse environmental and social impacts and achieve high standards of 
customer service and health and safety. This is embedded in management 
and employee reward schemes, where achieving customer service and 
health and safety targets remain key performance parameters. Marshalls 
won the Corporate Social Responsibility Award at the prestigious 
PLC Awards in March 2017.

Governance
We continue to comply with all the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as outlined in our Corporate Governance Statement 
on pages 36 to 41. The Board remains committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance and to operating in accordance 
with strong ethical and corporate social responsibility principles. A large 
proportion of management’s remuneration is in shares which must be 
retained for up to 5 years. This ensures a strong alignment between the 
interests of management and our shareholders.

The Group continues to enhance its Annual Report disclosures to ensure 
they give a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects.

STRATEGIC REPORTChief Executive’s Statement

The Group has continued to deliver 
strong profit growth in 2017

We are now planning beyond 2020 
to progress the development of 
our strategic objectives in the 
longer term.”

 • Profit before tax up 13% to £52.1 million after charging 

approximately £1 million of acquisition costs.

 • The planned integration of CPM is on track with 

our expectations.

 • The Group’s positive cash generation has continued.

 • Commitment to self help capital investment 
programme and new product development.

 • Digital strategy development progressing well.

Introduction
The Group has continued to deliver strong profit growth in 2017. 
Continued progress has been made in the year to deliver the 2020 
Strategy and the self help programme to support organic growth is 
progressing well. Sales and order intake have remained strong in the 
first couple of months of 2018. Based on public indicators we believe 
we continue to outperform our peers and gain market share. The Group’s 
2020 Strategy is now in its third year and we have continued to deliver 
on its core aspects. We are now planning beyond 2020 to progress the 
development of our strategic objectives over the longer term.

As a result of our continued focus on strategic growth and operational 
efficiency initiatives, the Group has delivered an operating profit in 
2017 of £53.4 million (2016: £47.6 million), an increase of 12 per cent. 
This result is after charging £1.2 million of operational restructuring 
costs and £0.8 million of acquisition costs.

CPM Group Limited (“CPM”) was acquired on 19 October 2017. CPM 
is a precast concrete manufacturer which specialises in underground 
water management solutions and the acquisition is in line with our 
stated 2020 Strategy to complement our organic plans with targeted 
acquisitions. CPM has traded strongly since acquisition and the planned 
integration of CPM is in line with our expectations. 

Marshalls is a leading brand with a significant market position. Our strong 
investment case is covered in more detail on pages 4 and 5. Marshalls 
remains a benchmark for excellence and the 3 cornerstone themes of

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

customer service, quality and sustainability continue to put the customer 
at the very heart of our business model and investment proposition.

Your Chairman, Andrew Allner is retiring both from the Board, and 
as Chairman, after many years of service. On behalf of the Company, 
I would like to place on record my thanks to Andrew for his excellent 
stewardship and his significant contribution to the ongoing 
development and growth of Marshalls.

2017 trading summary
Group revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 was up 8 per cent 
at £430.2 million (2016: £396.9 million). Group revenue includes £9.0 million 
from CPM. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of CPM, Group 
revenue was up 6 per cent. 

Sales in the Domestic end market, which represented approximately 
32 per cent of Group sales, continue to outperform CPA forecasts, and 
were up 12 per cent compared with the prior year period. The survey of 
domestic installers at the end of February 2018 revealed order books of 
10.8 weeks (2017: 11.0 weeks) which compared with 11.7 weeks at the 
end of October 2017.

Excluding CPM, sales in the Public Sector and Commercial end market, 
which represented approximately 61 per cent of Group sales, were up 
2 per cent compared with 2016. The Group continues to target those 
parts of the market where higher levels of growth are anticipated 
including New Build Housing, Water Management and Rail.

The core Commercial and Domestic businesses continue to deliver 
benefits from operational efficiency improvements and our network 

STRATEGIC REPORTof manufacturing sites remains a key competitive strength. Revenues in 
our Emerging UK Businesses increased by 2 per cent, compared with the 
prior year. The improved performance of our Street Furniture business 
has been particularly encouraging in 2017, and the growth in sustainable 
profitability of our Emerging UK Businesses remains a key part of the 
2020 Strategy. The growth of protective security street furniture 
continues and this is explained in more detail on page 16.

International revenue grew by 19 per cent during 2017 and represents 
approximately 5 per cent of Group sales. Marshalls has made continued 
progress in developing the International business and trading performance 
has improved in line with the revenue growth. The Group continues to 
develop opportunities by improving its global supply chains and routes 
to market.

Profit before tax increased by 13 per cent to £52.1 million (2016: £46.0 million) 
and EBITDA increased by 12 per cent to £67.9 million (2016: £60.8 million). 
Basic EPS was 21.52 pence (2016: 18.95 pence), an increase of 14 per cent. 

Profit before tax is stated after charging £1.2 million of operational 
restructuring costs and £0.8 million of acquisition costs in relation 
to the Group’s acquisition of CPM. 

Capital discipline remains a key priority and the Group’s strong cash 
generation has continued. Net debt at 31 December 2017 was £24.3 million 
(2016: £5.4 million cash) and reflects the total cash outflow of £41.4 million 
in connection with the acquisition of CPM. Operating Cash flow was 
100 per cent of EBITDA.

Acquisition of CPM 
Water Management is a key focus area for the Group and the acquisition 
of CPM is a significant step towards the Group’s stated strategy of providing 
a full water management capability within its product range. CPM will 
enable us to offer customers a broader product choice that complements 
our existing water management offering. Previously, Marshalls did not 
trade in below ground UK drainage products, so the acquisition has 
extended the Group’s product range below ground. CPM operates in 
the collect, conveyance, clean, hold and release, and recycle areas of the 
underground market and the product ranges include pipes, traditional 
and sealed manholes, attenuation tanks and flow control and rainwater 
harvesting systems. 

Current priorities and operational strategy
The Group’s 2020 Strategy is now in its third year and we have again 
delivered on its core aspects. The Group’s strategy remains to grow the 
business, deliver increasing operating margins in all businesses and 
improve the Group’s return on capital employed (“ROCE”). We are now 
planning beyond 2020 so as to progress the development of our strategic 
objectives over the longer term. 

During 2017, further progress has been made with the self help capital 
investment programme, the development of new products and the Group’s 
digital strategy. These organic projects have been complemented 
by the acquisition of CPM and its planned integration is on track with 
our expectations. Both aspects have allowed us to improve the level of 
our sustainable operating margins with the Group reporting an increase 
from 12.0 per cent to 12.4 per cent during the year.

ROCE, defined as EBITA / shareholders’ funds plus net debt, was 
24.8 per cent for the year ended 31 December 2017, which was up 
8 per cent year-on-year. This ROCE calculation excludes the impact 
of CPM and is therefore on a like-for-like basis. 

Capital expenditure was £22.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2017, 
which included £8.6 million of additional “self help” investment. Capital 
expenditure of £28.0 million is planned for 2018. We continue to 
generate a good pipeline of capital investment projects that will drive 
future organic growth. In addition, increases in research and new 
product development expenditure continue to be made. 

Notwithstanding the acquisition of CPM, we continue to target bolt-on 
acquisitions within our identified growth sectors of Water Management, 
Street Furniture and Minerals. Our approach remains cautious and any 

proposed acquisition target will be carefully assessed against strict 
criteria and will be thoroughly considered during the detailed due 
diligence phase. 

Marshalls’ digital strategy remains a key priority and continued 
investment is being directed to enhancing capability and to drive a 
“digital first“ approach. The digital strategy is underpinned by continuous 
improvement driven by data analysis and customer insight. Our web 
and mobile applications enable customers to model their requirements 
and allow digital access to the registered installer base. 

The Group’s strategic initiatives are set out in detail in the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 33.

Innovation and new product development
In the core Landscape Products business, the growth in revenue from 
new products continued strongly, increasing by 4.2 per cent during 2017. 
The objective is to deliver innovative market leading new products that 
are aligned with customer needs across all business areas. The development 
pipeline continues to be strong and the Group is committed to providing 
high performance product solutions. All the Group’s premium driveway 
products now feature advanced surface performance technology; 
examples include “Drivesys“ which has been designed to look and feel 
like natural stone and “Priora“ which has been specifically engineered 
to manage heavy rainfall. 

Further development includes project engineering to improve 
manufacturing efficiency and our specialist engineers and technicians 
deliver competitive advantage for Marshalls by combining machinery 
design and installation with process improvement. This enables Group 
to generate added value through innovation in materials, technology 
and product development. 

Improvements in operational efficiency
We are continuing to focus on improving operational and manufacturing 
efficiency. The Group adopts a flexible operating framework that aims 
to drive cost efficiency improvements across the controllable cost base 
and to develop flexible strategies within the supply chain. Our objective 
is to mitigate inflation on an ongoing basis to ensure sustainable business 
continuity and cost control. The Group network of 13 concrete 
manufacturing sites and quarries provides national geographic coverage 
and, with the implementation of best practice across the entire network, 
represents a key competitive advantage. 

The Group’s well invested sales and capital investment programmes 
provide the flexibility to manufacture products for both the Public 
Sector and Commercial and the Domestic end markets. This enhances 
operational flexibility which also remains a key priority. All the Group’s 
operations are supported by a centrally managed logistics and 
distribution capability. Manufactured products from this network, together 
with ethically sourced natural stone products imported from India, 
China and Vietnam, are supplied to distributors’ depots or direct to site. 

Health and safety
The Group is committed to safeguarding the health and safety of every 
employee and all stakeholders who may be affected by our undertakings. 
Maintaining the highest standards of health and safety remains a cornerstone 
of the Group’s culture and we are committed to the continual improvement 
in health and safety performance. 

During 2017, there was a 35 per cent reduction in days lost from workplace 
incidents, which is comfortably ahead of the Group’s headline target. 
The Group has continued to invest in health and safety awareness 
training for all managers and supervisory staff and we promote a culture 
in which all managers visibly demonstrate health and safety leadership.

Consumer Demand
There are some significant subtleties in the underlying consumer 
confidence data. 42 per cent of households, with income of more 
than £50,000, said they were planning a drive or garden project 
in the next 12 months, the second highest proportion in the last 
10 years. Indeed older, wealthy, mortgage free, homeowners are

THE CONSUMER MARKETS
Project Funding
An older demographic, with housing and pension wealth, prefer to 
improve rather than move. Pension release has become a significant 
source of funding for home improvements with the value released 
stabilising during 2017. These triple locked consumers are more 
resistant to falls in real wages than new homeowners.

Growth opportunities

The Group is constantly tracking the global mega trends, the shorter term trends in lifestyles 
and aesthetics and the developing requirements of our consumers and stakeholders.

Future Spaces
WHAT THIS MEANS?
Future Spaces is the result of intensive research with the aim 
of understanding how the format, planning, specification 
and materials used in the construction of public, private and 
commercial spaces, both indoors and outdoors, might look 
and function in 10 years time.

4 Global Mega-Trends

 1 SUSTAINABILITY

(Resources and the changing environment)

 2 CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC

(Shifting social and cultural expectations)

3 MASS URBANISATION
(The decade of the city)

4 GET SMART
(Smart is the new ‘green’)

Things that will change our landscape

1.  The blurring of public/private spaces

2. More people in smaller spaces

3. Demarcating multi-use spaces

4. The new wave of water management

5. Future concrete

6. The blossoming of biophilic design

7. Urban Greening

8. The rise of the super-landlord

9. The gender-neutralisation of society

10. Placemaking for the People

11. Building-in Resilience

12. The Circular Economy

LINK TO STRATEGY
We are using the 12 Future Spaces themes to give specific 
direction to our strategic objectives. These themes are being 
used to provide the strategic focus to: 

• new product development;
• new services and propositions; and 
• identify targeted acquisitions.

These themes are changing the nature of our built environment.

ACTION TAKEN TO DATE
We are constantly engaging with all our stakeholder groups to 
ensure a fully collaborative approach to planning and 
development. We are focusing development expenditure and 
growth initiatives into the areas of New Build Housing, Water 
Management, Minerals and Rail. The digital approach transcends 
all our development projects.

FUTURE DIRECTION 
Already we are seeing the emergence of the following themes 
and these are being built into our strategic planning: 

• the blurring of public and private spaces;
• place-making for the people;
• building in resilience; and
• the Circular Economy.

International Security
WHAT THIS MEANS?
In our lifetimes, the nature of terrorism has undergone significant 
change. The concept of terrorism describes the use of intentionally 
indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror and fear to 
achieve political, religious or ideological aim. The market for 
security barriers and bollards is developing as a response and 
is truly international. 

LINK TO STRATEGY
Only 15 per cent of people say that traditional concrete anti-terror 
barriers make them feel safer. Our strategy has been to use new 
technology to design solutions that Deter, Deflect and Defend, 
a three-tier strategy designed to reduce the threat long before 
vehicles are used to target assets.

ACTION TAKEN TO DATE
Marshalls Landscape Protection is based on increasingly resistant 
new security products that use new technology. The increasing 
market demand for hostile vehicle mitigation is a specific 
growth opportunity. 

FUTURE DIRECTION 
We believe that successful security should take a holistic approach 
and we are engaging with relevant stakeholder groups to drive 
effective new product development.

STRATEGIC REPORTDigitising the Customer Journey
WHAT THIS MEANS?
Over the last few years technology and software advancements 
have rapidly driven disruption and change to many industries. 
All businesses are now faced with the challenge of how best to 
utilise digital to transform their business. Our digital principles 
are designed to create an engaging customer experience.

LINK TO STRATEGY
In determining our strategic direction for digital development, we 
have identified 6 core principles which are firmly aligned with our 
strategic objectives:

• Design for the customer

• Promote agility 

• Collaboration

• Data driven 

• Open and transparent

• Robust governance

ACTION TAKEN TO DATE
The digital initiatives that have been taken to date all put the 
interests of stakeholders and the requirements of customers as 
the key priority. For example, web and mobile applications enable 
customers to model their requirements and allow full digital access. 

FUTURE DIRECTION 
The Group’s future direction is to embrace a “digital first“ 
approach. The strategic direction is “digital by default“ which seeks 
to apply the digital principles referred to above to People, Process 
and Technology such that digital is part of the Group’s culture. 

Climate Change
WHAT THIS MEANS?
The Government’s latest climate change risk assessment identifies 
flood risk, and particularly flooding from heavy downpours, as 
one of the key climate threats for the UK. This must be viewed 
alongside stresses on water resources, threats to biodiversity and 
natural habitats, and the repercussions for the UK from climate 
change impacts abroad.

Damage and disruption costs 

Low

Medium

High

Very high

Coastal Flooding

River Flooding

Surface water Flooding

Snow and Ice

Cold mortality

Drought

LINK TO STRATEGY
Water Management is a specific growth area and to ensure 
that our development initiatives are in line with our strategic 
objectives, the Group has determined that all new products must: 

• improve sustainability; 
• improve functionality;
• improve installation;

• improve aesthetics; and
• reduce whole life costs.

ACTION TAKEN TO DATE
The strategic objective is to provide a full water management 
capability and the acquisition of CPM is an important step in that 
direction. CPM’s product range serves the “below ground“ 
drainage market, whereas Marshalls had previously only been 
able to offer an “above ground“ linear drainage proposition. 

FUTURE DIRECTION 
The Group’s water management strategy is designed to deliver 
long-term sustainable value. Future growth objectives will cover 
above and below ground systems and will include “collect”, 
“convey”, “clean“ and “hold / release”systems.

STRATEGIC REPORTRisk Management and Principal Risks

Managing risk to deliver strategic objectives

Managing risk is key to the delivery of long-term sustainable improvement in shareholder value. 
All risks are aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives.

Achievements in 2017
In addition to the delivery of ongoing process and system 
enhancements that are designed to mitigate risk, the Group’s 
risk function has placed particular emphasis on the following areas 
during the year:

• Cyber risk has continued to be a major focus area for risk assessment. 

A further internal audit project has been undertaken by KPMG and 
continued improvements have been made to mitigate risk and 
improve IT security, business continuity and disaster recovery.

• Health and safety continues to be a focus area as the Group 

continually strives to reduce health and safety risk and improve 
performance. Additional staff training was undertaken in 2017. 

• Proactive supply chain management continues to be a focus area 
for the Group and an internal audit project has been undertaken 
by KPMG in 2017. This covered the adequacy of the Group’s policies, 
procedures and systems and the operation of key controls. 

• A detailed annual review of the Group’s capital structure has been 

undertaken to ensure it remains aligned with corporate growth 
objectives and the external market risk environment.

• The maintenance of a conservative capital structure with a strong 
balance sheet and comfortable headroom against bank facilities 
provides significant mitigation against potential funding risk.

Priorities for 2018
The priorities for the Group’s risk function in 2018 include the following 
areas of focus:

• The rapid pace of change in the wider environment necessitates 
cyber risk remaining a key priority for 2018. Further assignments 
and penetration tests are planned to ensure that the Group remains 
proactive in this area.

• The completion of a number of targeted projects will again

be a major focus for KPMG. In 2018, projects covering inventory
management, GDPR and human resource systems and procedures 
are planned. 

• Following the acquisition of CPM in October 2017, the successful 

integration of the business into the Group is a major focus area. The 
risk that the integration takes longer than anticipated and impacts 
financial performance has been included as a key item on the Group’s 
Risk Register. A post integration review is to be undertaken by KPMG. 

• Health and safety remains a major focus area. Significant increases 
in the financial penalty regime have increased the potential impact 
of health and safety incidents.

Approach to risk management
Risk management is the responsibility of the Board and is a key factor in 
the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives. The Board establishes the 
culture of effective risk management and is responsible for maintaining 
appropriate systems and controls. The Board sets the risk appetite and 
determines the policies and procedures that are put in place to mitigate 
exposure to risks.

Process
There is a formal ongoing process to identify, assess and analyse risks 
and those of a potentially significant nature are included in the Group 
Risk Register. The conclusion of the Group’s internal auditor, KPMG, is 
that the process continues to be a robust mechanism for monitoring 
and controlling the Group’s principal risks. 

The Group Risk Register is reviewed and updated at least every 6 months 
and the overall process is the subject of regular review. Risks are 
recorded with a full analysis and risk owners are nominated who have 
authority and responsibility for assessing and managing the risk. All risks 
are aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives and each risk is analysed 
for impact and probability to determine exposure and impact to the 
business and the determination of a “gross risk score“ enables risk 
exposure to be prioritised. External risks include the weather, political 
and economic conditions, the effect of legislation or other regulatory 
actions, the actions of competitors, foreign exchange, raw material 
prices and pension funding. Internal risks include investment in new 
products, new business strategies and acquisitions. In particular, during 
2017, the potential impact of Brexit and wider economic uncertainty 
has been considered in the assessment of risk 1 on page 22.

The Group seeks to mitigate exposure to all forms of strategic, financial 
and operational risk, both external and internal. The effectiveness of 
key mitigating controls is continually monitored and such controls 
are subjected to internal audit and periodic testing in order to provide 
independent verification where this is deemed appropriate. The 
effectiveness and impact of key controls are evaluated and this is 
used to determine a “net risk score“ for each risk. The process is used to 
develop action plans that are used to manage, or respond to, the risks 
and these are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis by the Group’s 
Audit Committee.

In addition, the Group has established a formal framework for the 
ongoing assessment of operational, financial and IT-based controls. 
The overriding objective is to gain assurance that the control framework 
is complete and that the individual controls are operating effectively. 
Additional independent verification checking of key controls and 
reconciliations are undertaken on a rolling basis. Such testing includes 
key controls over access to, and change permissions on, base data 
and metadata.

Risk appetite
The Group is prepared to accept a certain level of risk to remain 
competitive but continues to adopt a conservative approach to risk 
management. The risk framework is robust and provides clarity in 
determining the risks faced and the level of risk that we are prepared to 
accept. Marshalls continues to put in place detailed plans to manage all 
risks through strategies that are designed to either treat, transfer or 
terminate the source of the identified risk.

Viability Statement
After considering the principal risks overleaf, the Directors have assessed 
the prospects of the Group over a longer period than the period of at 
least 12 months required by the “going concern“ basis of accounting. 
The Directors consider that the Group’s risk management process 
satisfies the requirements of provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.

The Board considers annually, and on a rolling basis, a 3-year strategic 
plan, which is assessed with reference to the Group’s current position 
and prospects, the strategic objectives and the operation of the 
procedures and policies to manage the principal risks that might 
threaten the business model, future performance and target capital 
structure. In this assessment, security, flexibility and efficiency are the 
guiding principles that underpin the Group’s capital structure objectives. 

The Board continues to believe that 3 years is an appropriate period 
of assessment and, aligned with the Group’s strategic plan, the Directors 
also consider that they have reasonable visibility of the market over a 
3-year period to 31 December 2020. A 3-year period is consequently 
considered appropriate for the Viability Statement. The Group’s strategic 
plan includes an integrated model that incorporates income statement, 
balance sheet and cash flow projections. Key KPIs and financial ratios are 
reviewed along with the ongoing appropriateness of all assumptions 
used. Scenario planning is undertaken along with stress testing against 
downside sensitivities. The stress testing reflects the principal risks that 
could conceivably threaten the Group’s ability to continue operating 
as a going concern and has critically assessed downside scenarios that 
might give rise to sales volume reductions, deteriorating operating 
margins and increases in interest rates. None of the individual
sensitivities applied impact the Directors’ assessment of viability.
The stress testing applied in 2017 reflects a cautious economic outlook 
and remains a key part of the Group’s detailed approach to capital 
structure and forecasting. A significant stress test sensitivity has been 
applied to reflect a dramatic economic downturn and the Group’s 
updated Risk Register continues to identify external market factors as 
being the key risk. The stress testing has aimed to replicate the financial 
impact of the last recession as the core sensitivity, with significantly 
reduced sales volumes giving rise to a 33 per cent decrease in revenue 
over the next 3 years.

Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the next 3 years.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors have undertaken a robust, systematic assessment 
of the Group’s principal risks. These have been considered within 
the timeframe of 3 years, which aligns with our Viability 
Statement above.

LINK TO STRATEGY

NATURE OF RISK
The Group is dependent on the level of 
activity in its end markets. Accordingly, 
it is susceptible to economic downturn, 
the impact of Government policy and 
any political and economic uncertainty 
in relation to Brexit.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
The potential impact of Brexit and wider 
global macro-economic uncertainty could 
lead to lower activity levels which could 
reduce sales and production volumes. This 
could have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial results. The impact of exchange 
rate fluctuations could also have an adverse 
impact on material costs.

MITIGATING FACTORS
• The Group closely monitors trends 

and lead indicators, invests in market 
research and is an active member 
of the CPA. 

• The Group benefits from the diversity 

of its business and end markets. 

• The Group focuses on sales opportunities 
and strategic growth initiatives, together 
with quality, service and its supply chain.

• The Group focuses on its supplier 

relationships, flexible contracts and 
the use of hedging instruments.

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

Given the perception of increased global 
economic uncertainty, this risk has increased 
and this is reflected in wider economic 
forecasts. The CPA forecasts have softened 
slightly in recent months. 

There continues to be growth potential 
in certain focus areas, e.g. New Build 
Housing, Water Management and Rail. 
Forward indicators in the core business 
remain positive.

The proactive development of the product 
range continues to offer protection.

NATURE OF RISK
Inadequate controls and procedures over 
the protection of intellectual property, 
sensitive employee information and market 
influencing data.

The failure to improve controls against cyber 
security risk quickly enough, given the rapid 
pace of change and the continuing 
introduction of new threats.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
Risk of data loss causing financial 
and reputational risk.

MITIGATING FACTORS
• Use of IT security policies.
• The undertaking of regular cyber security 

risk audits by specialists and the quick 
introduction of mitigation controls and 
other recommended procedure updates.

• Sensitive data is currently restricted 
to selected senior and experienced 
employees who are used to handling 
such data. 

• Where sensitive data is made available to 

third parties, it is done under 
confidentiality agreements with 
reputable suppliers.

• A rolling programme of awareness 

training for staff.

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

This remains a high profile area and 
considerable focus is being given to 
promoting awareness of IT security policies. 

Appropriate tools and training procedures 
are in place to protect sensitive data when 
stored and transmitted between parties 
(e.g. encryption of hard drives, restricted 
USB devices, secure data transmission 
mechanisms and third party security audits).

NATURE OF RISK
The successful integration of CPM into the 
Marshalls Group is a significant business 
issue for 2018.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
There is a risk that the integration of CPM 
could take longer than expected. This could 
impact the expected financial performance 
and reduce the positive impact of potential 
synergy benefits. 

MITIGATING FACTORS
• Certain ongoing legal and regulatory 

matters were identified during due 
diligence and the sale and purchase 
agreement included risk mitigation by 
requiring £12 million to be paid into an 
escrow account pending the resolution 
of these issues. The Group has a right of 
reimbursement of amounts held in the 
escrow account to the extent that any 
liability crystallises in respect of these 
ongoing legal and regulatory matters.

• The Group has a detailed integration plan 

which covers all business areas and is 
focused on risk reduction and maximising 
opportunity.

• The integration plan has Executive level 

focus and is being administered by 
a dedicated Integration Manager.

• A post integration review is to be 
undertaken by KPMG in Q3 2018. 

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

The acquisition of CPM in October 2017 has 
created a new risk for the Group, although 
the integration project is receiving 
significant management focus.

NATURE OF RISK
The Group is exposed to the impact 
of prolonged periods of bad weather.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
Adverse working conditions could give rise 
to disruption and delays that might reduce 
short-term activity levels. This could reduce 
sales and production volumes and therefore 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial results.

MITIGATING FACTORS
• The Group has a continuing focus on 
new product development, including 
landscape water management.

• The Group is developing its internal 

flooring offer and International strategy 
in order to diversify its activities.

• The development of the Group’s 
Water Management business is 
a significant opportunity. The acquisition 
of CPM has significantly moved the 
Group forward in this area and the 
acquisition has been a significant step 
in the stated strategy of providing a full 
water management capability.

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

Weather conditions are beyond 
the Group’s control.

NATURE OF RISK
The UK business has a number of key 
customers, in particular the national 
merchants. This is partly as a result of 
the consolidated nature of this market.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
The loss of a significant customer may give 
rise to a significant adverse effect on the 
Group’s financial results.

MITIGATING FACTORS
• The Group focuses on brand and new 

product development, quality and 
customer service improvement.

• The Group maintains a national network 
of manufacturing and distribution sites. 
• The Group undertakes ongoing reviews 
of trading policies and relationships and 
maintains constant communication 
with customers.

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

Although the underlying risk continues, the 
effective management of key relationships 
and the ongoing diversification of the 
business are serving to mitigate the risk.

NATURE OF RISK
The Group has a number of existing 
competitors who compete on range, 
price, quality and service. 

Potential new low cost competitors may 
be attracted into the market through 
increased demand for imported natural 
stone products.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
The increased competition could reduce 
volumes and margins on manufactured 
and traded products.

MITIGATING FACTORS
• The Group has unique selling points that 
differentiate the Marshalls branded offer. 

• The Group focuses on quality, service, 

reliability and ethical standards that 
differentiate Marshalls from 
competitor products. 

• The Group continues to have the 

lowest cost to market. 

• The Group has a continuing focus 

on new product development. 

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

The more uncertain market environment 
has not led to any significant changes in 
competitive pressure.

LINK TO STRATEGY

LINK TO STRATEGY

NATURE OF RISK
The Group is susceptible to significant 
increases in the price of raw materials, 
utilities, fuel oil and haulage costs and 
decreases in vehicle availability.

As demand increases, the Group is 
potentially more exposed to the risk of 
temporary raw material shortages. 

POTENTIAL IMPACT
The increased costs could reduce margins 
and may be further impacted in the event 
of imbalances in the mix of regional activity.

The risk of market demand exceeding raw 
material supply could lead to inefficient 
production, which could reduce margins. 

MITIGATING FACTORS
• The Group benefits from the diversity 

of its business and end markets. 

• The Group focuses on its supplier 

relationships, flexible contracts and 
the use of hedging instruments. 

• The Group utilises sales pricing and 

purchasing policies designed to 
mitigate the risks. 

• The Group uses specialist 

delivery vehicles.

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

Cost inflation remains a risk as demand for 
raw materials increases against a backdrop 
of increased economic uncertainty. All 
importers are faced with the same issues.

The risk of temporary shortages is mitigated 
by proactive supply chain management and 
the use of alternative suppliers.

NATURE OF RISK
The Group may be adversely affected by an 
unexpected reputational event, e.g. an issue 
in its ethical supply chain or due to a health 
and safety incident.

The impact of the “Environmental Protocol“ leads 
to the need for increasingly expensive processes.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
An incident could lead to a disruption to 
production and the supply of products for 
customers. This could increase costs and 
have a potential negative impact on the 
Group’s reputation.

An environmental contamination event may 
lead to a prosecution and to reputational loss.

Significant increases in the penalty regime 
have increased the potential financial 
impact of health and safety as well as 
environmental incidents.

MITIGATING FACTORS
•  The Group employs compliance procedures, 
policies and independent audit processes 
which seek to ensure that local, national and 
international regulatory and compliance 
procedures are fully complied with. 

• The Group uses professional specialists 

covering carbon reduction, water 
management and biodiversity. 

• The Group focuses on the 

implementation of ISO standards.

• The Group has a formal Group 
sustainability strategy focusing 
on impact reduction.

CHANGE IN RISK IN THE YEAR

The Group continues to improve compliance 
procedures within the supply chain. 

Health and safety and the potential impact 
of the Bribery Act continue to be high 
profile risk areas. These areas are receiving 
additional management focus, but the 
impact of the underlying risk has increased.

The Group is unable to predict future 
changes in environmental laws or policies 
or the ultimate cost of compliance with 
such laws or policies.

Public Sector and Commercial
Excluding CPM, sales in the Public Sector and Commercial end market 
were up 2.3 per cent compared with 2016. Including the post-acquisition 
contribution of CPM, sales in the Public Sector and Commercial end 
market were up 5.8 per cent and represented 63 per cent of Group sales.

Marshalls’ strategy is to offer sustainable integrated solutions to customers, 
architects and contractors. The Group’s technical and sales teams remain 
particularly focused on those market areas where future demand is 
considered to be greatest including New Build Housing, Water Management 
and Rail. The Group is outperforming the market in these areas. Our 
“Design Space“ office in Central London continues to showcase the 
Group’s brand leading capabilities and provides customers with information 
about new products, access to samples and technical advice.

The Group’s unique national network of manufacturing sites remains 
a core strength and, as far as our mineral reserves are concerned, the 
“Marshalls Stone Standard“ quality mark gives customers full assurance 
that all Marshalls’ natural stone not only meets, but exceeds the base 
technical levels outlined in BS7533. 

Domestic
Revenue in the Domestic end market grew strongly, increasing by 
12.1 per cent. Sales to the UK Domestic end market now represent 
approximately 32 per cent of Group sales.

Installer order books at the end of February 2018 were 10.8 weeks 
(February 2017: 10.9 weeks), compared with 11.7 weeks at the end of 
October 2017. The Group continues to receive good feedback from its 
customers and installers for the consistency and quality of service and 
we remain focused on enhancing the overall customer experience by 
extending digitisation and commitment to innovation. The Group’s 
industry leading standards remained high in 2017 with a combined 
customer service measure of 98 per cent (2016: 98 per cent).

The Group’s strategy continues to be to drive more sales through quality 
installers. The Marshalls Register of approved domestic installers is unique 
and comprises approximately 1,900 teams. The objectives continue to 
be to develop the Marshalls’ brand, improve the product mix, ensure a 
consistently high standard of quality, excellent customer service and 
marketing support and maintain good geographical coverage. 

International
Sales to International markets increased by 19.3 per cent and represents 
approximately 5 per cent of Group sales. The Group continues to develop 

its global supply chains and infrastructure to ensure that international 
operations are aligned with market opportunities. Revenue growth has 
been strong in the US during 2017 and the new sales office in Dubai has 
delivered further sales growth in the Middle East. 

Acquisition of CPM
Water Management is a strategic focus for Marshalls and the acquisition 
of CPM on 19 October 2017 is a significant step forward for the Group, 
extending the product range into the new area of below ground 
drainage. CPM has a comprehensive range of technical and innovative 
water management solutions and has a strong track record of quality 
and service. 

The acquisition of CPM has contributed £9.0 million to Group revenue 
and sales for the full 12 month period ended 31 December 2017 were 
£55.3 million. Recent growth has been driven by an expansion in 
production capabilities and the sites at Mells, in Somerset, and 
Pollington, in East Yorkshire, are both able to produce around 
170,000 tonnes per annum. The provision of bespoke “off-site“ 
solutions is a particular growth area. 

The acquisition has been funded from existing facilities and an additional 
£20 million debt facility was established to maintain headroom capacity.

Operating profit was £53.4 million (2016: £47.6 million), which 
represents an increase of 12.2 per cent. This is after charging £1.2 million 
of operational restructuring costs and £0.8 million of acquisition costs. 
EBITDA increased by 11.7 per cent to £67.9 million (2016: £60.8 million) 
and EPS was 21.52 pence (2016: 18.95 pence), an increase of 13.6 per cent. 

ROCE remained strong and, notwithstanding the acquisition of CPM 
in October 2017, was 20.8 per cent (2016: 23 per cent), on a reported 
basis, at 31 December 2017. Capital employed has increased by 23.8 per 
cent to £261.8 million (2016: £211.7 million) following the acquisition of 
CPM. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of CPM, ROCE was up 
8 per cent at 24.8 per cent. This reflects the Group’s tight control and 
management of inventory and monetary working capital.

The table illustrates the impact of operational gearing in the UK 
businesses and shows that growth has continued to be ahead of CPA 
forecasts. The Group’s Landscape Products business is a reportable 
segment servicing both the UK Public Sector and Commercial 
and UK Domestic end markets. Revenue increased by £28.4 million 
and operating profit grew by £5.1 million in the Landscape 
Products business.

There has been continued development of the Emerging UK Businesses 
during 2017 and revenue increased by 2 per cent compared with the 
prior year period. The emerging UK businesses include Street Furniture 
and Mineral Products and they continue to be a key strategic focus and 
a positive driver for growth. 

Continued development of the 2020 Strategy
During 2017, capital investment in property, plant and equipment 
(including software) totalled £22.5 million (2016: £13.9 million). This 
compares with depreciation of £14.5 million (2016: £13.2 million). This 
includes a significant increase in self help capital projects to deliver new, 
innovative products and to drive through sustainable cost reductions 
and improvements in operational efficiency. We continue to have a 
strong pipeline of such projects and capital expenditure of £28 million 
is planned for 2018. 

Research and development expenditure in the year ended 31 December 
2017 amounted to £3.9 million (2016: £3.4 million). Investment in 
research and development covers a number of areas including the 
development of the Group’s project engineering and manufacturing 
capabilities, concrete and other materials technology innovations and 
extending the new product pipeline. Revenue from new products 
increased by 4.2 per cent during 2017 in the core Landscape Products 
business and over the last 3 years has increased by 14 per cent.

Further investment continues to be made to develop our wide-ranging 
digital strategy, encompassing digital trading, digital marketing and 
digital business. More details are provided on page 17.

Net financial expenses 
Net finance costs were £1.4 million (2016: £1.6 million) and interest was 
covered 38.5 times (2016: 29.9 times). Interest charges on bank loans 
totalled £1.0 million (2016: £1.1 million) and, including scheme 
administration costs, there was an IAS 19 notional interest charge of £0.4 
million (2016: £0.5 million) in relation to the Group’s Pension Scheme. 
The IAS 19 notional interest includes interest on obligations under the 
defined benefit section of the Marshalls plc Pension Scheme, net of the 
expected return on Scheme assets. 

Taxation
The effective tax rate was 19.1 per cent (2016: 18.5 per cent), the prior 
year having benefited from a deferred tax credit arising principally in 
relation to the settlement of share-based payments. The Group has paid 
£10.5 million (2016: £7.1 million) of corporation tax during the year. 
Deferred tax of £0.1 million in relation to the actuarial gain arising on the 
defined benefit Pension Scheme in the year has been taken to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Marshalls has again been awarded the Fair Tax Mark, which recognises 
social responsibility and transparency in a company’s tax affairs. The 
Group’s tax approach has long been closely aligned with the Fair Tax 
Mark’s objectives and this is supported by the Group’s tax strategy and 
fully transparent tax disclosures.

Case study
Self help capital expenditure
• Self help capital expenditure is additional to ongoing spend;

• Must be “value added”, targeting volume growth areas and 

cost reduction and efficiency opportunities;

• Objective is <3 years payback and a healthy IRR;

• Self help capital expenditure of £8.6 million in 2017, 

with a similar level planned for 2018;

• New investment in a modern production facility in 

Natural Stone Paving;

• £3 million investment in saws, automation and 

optimisation of stone processing; and

• Significant improvement in yields and efficiency.

Dividends
The recommended “supplementary dividend“ of 4.00 pence (2016: 3.00 
pence) per share is discretionary and non-recurring and recognises that 
the business has sufficient capital both to finance increased investment 
and to maintain a conservative and flexible capital structure. When 
added to the normal full year dividend of 10.20 pence, this gives a total 
dividend for the year of 14.20 pence, which represents an increase 
against the prior year of 21 per cent. The incremental cash outflow in 
2017 in relation to the supplementary dividend has been £5.9 million 
and will be approximately £7.9 million in 2018.

Net assets at 31 December 2017 were £237.6 million (2016: £217.1 million). 
The Group has a strong balance sheet with a good range of medium-term 
bank facilities available to fund investment initiatives to generate growth. 

Credit management
The Group continues to prioritise the close control of inventory and the 
effective management of working capital. Debtor days remain industry 
leading due to continued close control of credit management procedures. 
The Group maintains credit insurance which provides excellent 
intelligence to minimise the number and value of bad debts and 
ultimately provides compensation if bad debts are incurred. 

Pension
The balance sheet value of the Group’s defined benefit Pension Scheme 
was a surplus of £4.1 million (2016: £4.3 million). The amount has been 
determined by the Scheme actuary. The fair value of the Scheme assets at 
31 December 2017 was £354.7 million (2016: £360.1 million) and the present 
value of the Scheme liabilities is £350.6 million (2016: £355.8 million). 
These changes have resulted in an actuarial gain, net of deferred 
taxation, of £0.3 million (2016: £1.4 million actuarial gain) and this has 
been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The Company has previously agreed with the Trustee that no cash 
contributions are now payable under the funding and recovery plan.

Capital allocation
The Group’s capital allocation strategy is to maintain a strong 
balance sheet and flexible capital structure that recognises 
cyclical risk, while focusing on security, efficiency and liquidity.

The capital allocation strategy prioritises organic capital 
investment, supported by an increase in new product development 
and research and development expenditure. The strategy also 
targets selective bolt-on acquisition opportunities. In addition, 
the objective is to maintain a dividend cover of 2 times earnings 
over the medium term and to give consideration to 
supplementary dividends.

Net debt at 31 December 2017 was £24.3 million, which reflects the 
payment of consideration totalling £38.2 million in relation to the 
acquisition of CPM, together with the impact of CPM’s net borrowings 
taken on of £3.0 million. This compares with a positive cash position 
of £5.4 million at 31 December 2016. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 
0.35 times at 31 December 2017 which is comfortably within our target 
range, of between 0 to 1 times, and well below covenant levels.

Cash management continues to be a high priority with continuing 
focus on the close control of inventory and the effective management 
of working capital. The key working capital metrics are in line with plan.

Borrowing facilities
On 17 August 2017, the Group renewed its short-term working capital 
facilities of £25.0 million. This includes a seasonal working capital facility 
of £10.0 million which is available between 1 February and 31 August 
each year. On 16 October 2017 the Group took out an additional 
committed facility of £20.0 million. The Group continues its policy of 
having a range of committed bank facilities in place with a positive 
spread of medium-term maturities that now extends to 2022. The 
Group’s committed facilities are all revolving credit facilities with interest 
charged at a variable rate based on LIBOR.

The total bank borrowing facilities at 31 December 2017 amounted to 
£115.0 million (2016: £95.0 million) of which £71.1 million (2016: £80.0 million), 
remained unutilised. Interest cover and net debt to EBITDA covenants in 
the facilities were comfortably met at the year end. The bank facilities are 
unsecured save for inter-company guarantees between the Group and 
its subsidiary undertakings in favour of the facility banks.

Cash generation
The Group is significantly cash generative. In the year ended 
31 December 2017 net cash flow from operating activities was 
£57.3 million (2016: £49.4 million).

technology. Proceeds from the sale of targeted property assets contributed 
£3.9 million (2016: £3.8 million). The increase in net debt arising on the 
acquisition of CPM comprises the cash outflow in connection with the 
acquisition and the fair value of borrowings acquired. Dividend

STRATEGIC REPORTSustainability Strategy

At the heart of all we do

By being a responsible business we are leveraging sustainability to drive 
competitive advantage for our business.

Human Rights
OBJECTIVES
Marshalls supports human rights consistent with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. In conducting business across the globe 
we respect these rights and seek to uphold, preserve and promote 
them. Our corporate responsibility to respect human rights means 
acting with due diligence to avoid infringing upon the rights of others, 
and addressing any issues that do occur. We recognise that our 
responsibility applies across all business activities, including business 
relationships with third parties and those within our supply chain. 

2018 PRIORITIES
• Continue to focus on the issue of modern slavery and improve 

compliance procedures within the supply chain; and
• Continue to collaborate with multiple stakeholders.

PROGRESS
Human rights regulation for business continues on an upward 
trajectory and the issue of modern slavery rightly remains firmly in 
the spotlight. We are working with multiple stakeholders across the 
world to help make our business operations and supply chains as 
toxic as possible to the organised criminals who seek to exploit 
vulnerable individuals and corporations. We are collaborating with 
governments, UN agencies, human rights observers, suppliers, 
workers and communities. Our human rights due diligence and 
monitoring and implementation is extremely dynamic reflecting 
the nature of the human rights arena. Our active global supply 
chain risk mapping processes together with our Ethical Risk Index 
further guide our robust decision making processes.

Detailed ethical risk indices are in place for 
44 natural stone product supply chains.

FUTURE GOALS
• Further develop the Group’s global supply chain risk 

mapping processes; and

• Continue to develop our Ethical Risk Index methodology 

and procedures.

Labour Rights
OBJECTIVES
From living wages in the UK to the elimination of child labour in 
India, we are committed to ensuring that what is good for business 
is good for society. Our approach to labour rights is driven by the 
Ethical Trading Initiative (“ETI”) Base Code which we adopted in 2005. 
To ensure that the Base Code is embedded within operations and 
supply chains we have social auditors in India, China and Vietnam. 

2018 PRIORITIES
• Continue to promote ETI membership, peer reviews and our 

“Hope for Justice“ Strategic Partnership;

• Conduct ETI Base Code social and ethical audits in India, 

China and Vietnam; and

• Develop the use of social auditors in India, to complement the 

ETI ethical audits.

PROGRESS
We continue to be members of the ETI and our new ETI Strategic 
Plan has been developed to support, strengthen and maximise 
our continued drive to uphold and strengthen labour rights across 
the globe. The Plan honours our commitment to ETI Base Code 
implementation and will further embed and integrate ethical trade 
into business activities and decision making; ultimately it will seek 
to improve conditions for workers, their families and communities.

Marshalls have been accredited by the Living Wage 
Foundation since 2015.

FUTURE GOALS
• Further embed and integrate ethical trade into business practice;
• Promote procurement principles that comply with the UN Global 

Compact and ETI base code;

• Continue to improve conditions for workers, their families 

and communities; and

•  Maintain commitment to the abolition of slavery in all its forms.

Sustainability overview
Corporate responsibility, awareness and mitigation of adverse impacts on the environment, and positive engagement with our community 
and employees have long been core values of Marshalls. We aim to align our business values, purpose and strategy with the social, economic 
and environmental needs of our stakeholders, embedding responsible and ethical business policies and practices in everything we do.

The Environment
OBJECTIVES
Our environmental objectives and targets are driven by a strong 
commitment to compliance coupled with mitigation plans to 
address legislative and physical business risks, whilst maximising 
opportunities against a corporate strategic commitment to be 
a sustainable business. At the heart of Marshalls’ sustainable business 
model is an approach which combines key business issues and key 
performance indicators with third party verification, legislation and 
industry standards including ISO14001 for environmental 
management and ISO50001 for energy management. 

2018 PRIORITIES
• Continue to focus on the Group’s Sustainability Strategy, 

including key focus areas such as eSight energy monitoring 
systems and increasing use of rainwater capture;

• Further develop detailed site energy usage and carbon intensity 

analysis and action plans; and

• Maintain adherence to all legislative and ISO requirements for 

environmental and energy management.

PROGRESS
We have clear environmental, energy and climate change policies 
in place and are on track to meet our policy commitments. Key 
environmental issues for us are climate change, water and biodiversity. 
Marshalls’ successful management of environmental issues has been 
recognised by third parties such as Business in the Community.

Over 2,500 individual product carbon footprints. 

FUTURE GOALS
•  Continue to develop environmental targets as key business drivers
to increase sustainability, cost efficiency and shareholder value; 
• Ensure that environmental targets are aligned with operational 

and strategic planning; and

• Invest in smart systems that allow real time monitoring of energy 

consumption in relation to carbon reduction measures.

Responsible Business
OBJECTIVES
Marshalls is committed to conducting business with the utmost 
integrity and in accordance with the principles set out in the 
Bribery Act 2010. Greater transparency leads to increased trust. 
This in turn provides the solid foundations required for sustainable 
growth. By making our financial, social, environmental and ethical 
data transparent we can inspire trust which will lead to customers 
buying more of our products, investors purchasing more of our 
stock, and engaged employees working harder and smarter.

2018 PRIORITIES
• Further develop the Group’s ongoing monitoring, training 

and compliance procedures;

• Continue to ensure that appropriate training is undertaken 

in relation to responsible business practice, including the 
Group’s anti-bribery and corruption policies and 
procurement procedures; and

• Continue to maintain our Fair Tax Mark accreditation and to 
be open and transparent about the Group’s tax affairs. Our 
commitment to responsible tax practice ensures that we seek to 
pay the right amount of tax at the right time in the right place. 

PROGRESS
We are clear that bribery is not a victimless crime and that it 
discourages effective trading by diverting funds away from projects 
designed to build communities and help the most disadvantaged 
in our society. We have a clear Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy and 
have launched and effectively communicated Marshalls’ Supplier 
Code of Conduct. This has been further embedded, with employees 
and suppliers, through a new IT training platform.

Marshalls is making a significant contribution to the 
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.

FUTURE GOALS
• Continue to promote the UN Global Compact’s commitment to 

sustainable development and the implementation of the UN’s 
17 Sustainable Development Goals;

• To make an increasing impact in the implementation of these 

goals – especially those goals where Marshalls is particularly 
well-placed to make a significant contribution. 

Marshalls’ sustainable business model 
Empowered by our brand values of leadership, excellence, trust and sustainability we work passionately and diligently to uphold 
the United Nations Global Compact pillars of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The Group has a sustainable business 
plan and has set KPIs for the key areas of this plan. It addresses economic, social and environmental aspects of Marshalls’ operations.

STRATEGIC REPORTSustainability Strategy continued

Carbon emissions – disclosure
Marshalls’ Energy and Climate Change Policy confirms the Group’s 
commitment to reducing the energy and carbon impact of its business. 
Our target is to reduce Group absolute CO2e emissions in line with the 
UK Government’s targets (37 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 
from a 1990 baseline). The progress indicates that reductions are in line 
with the 2020 and 2050 targets.

The Group complied with its legal obligation under the Government’s 
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (“CRC”) by 
submitting its Annual Report and surrendering appropriate Carbon 
allowances for the period April 2016 to March 2017 within the time limit 
imposed by the legislation. The Group continues to be certified to the 
Carbon Trust Standard. The Group’s approach to the Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) legislation was to define its energy 
management in compliance with the international standard for energy 
management ISO50001, gaining accreditation in November 2015 and 
maintaining this through 2017. The Group continues to voluntarily 
disclose data to the “Carbon Disclosure Project“ receiving a B rating for 
its 2017 submission. This disclosure includes the wider carbon 
management performance over time and also provides an insight for 
shareholders regarding the Group’s energy, carbon and climate change 
impact management programme.

Marshalls has a mandatory duty to report its annual Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions (“GHG”) under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 and the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. 
Marshalls uses The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised edition) and the August 2017 
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published 
CO2e conversion factors to measure its GHG emissions.

The Group has conducted an audit of its UK fugitive emissions and 
found these to be 0.6 per cent of the Group total emissions; accordingly 
these are excluded from the report.

The chart below (left) illustrates the Group’s UK absolute CO2e emissions 
in tonnes, including transport activities, between 2013 and 2017.

The chart below (right) illustrates the Group’s CO2e intensity emissions 
as a proportion of production output, including transport activities 
between 2013 and 2017.

A number of factors have contributed to the Group’s energy performance 
during the year including reduction in carbonisation of the electricity grid 
supply, product mix, weather (temperature impacting on the use of heating 
/ cooling fuel) and energy management activities. Two increases in 
emissions during the year have resulted from the acquisition of CPM Group, 
which had added (absolute) 760 tonnes and (intensity) 11.44 kg per tonne 
production, to the annual data and an increase in the LGV fleet by 11 per 
cent full time equivalent vehicles to satisfy customer requirements.

The Group reports that it is responsible for the GHG emissions of 
Marshalls NV. The CO2 emission from Marshalls NV activities (using the 
latest International Energy Associations Emission Factor) in 2017 was 
(absolute) 520 tonnes and (intensity) 10.60 kg per tonne production. 

Marshalls aims to publish its environmental KPI performance for the financial 
year in a separate document, the Marshalls’ Environmental KPI 2018 Report. 
This will cover the energy performance in more detail, together with reporting 
of the environmental governance, policies, management and key 
environmental impact areas such as waste, water and packaging. The 
Environmental KPI 2018 Report will also detail our work with internationally 
recognised expert bodies such as the Carbon Trust and the RSPB.

This section of the Annual Report has been audited by a qualified 
verifier on behalf of BSI. On the basis of the work undertaken this carbon 
statement is considered to be a fair reflection of the Group’s 
performance during 2017 and contains no misleading information.

Health and safety
Marshalls is committed to meeting the highest safety standards for 
all its employees, reinforcing and developing its safety processes, and 
developing a competent workforce with a view to achieving long-term 
improvement gains. This remains a key priority for the business. 

The achievement of annual health and safety improvement targets is 
directly linked to the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior

In 2017, the Executive Board agreed a formal 5-year Health and Safety strategy 
with set objectives. This strategy clearly demonstrates the commitment of the 
business to take the safety of its employees to the highest level. 

The business also introduced a Safety, Health, Environmental and Quality 
(“SHEQ”) concerns reporting process. The SHEQ concerns system not 
only gives all employees the tools to report concerns, but also ensures 
management identifies the root causation ensuring the right actions are 
taken to prevent a re-occurrence. 

In 2018 the main Health and Safety initiatives will include: 

• The implementation of Marshalls’ mental health awareness 

programme. This involves the introduction of a mental health policy 
and support network, all management in the business receiving 
mental health awareness training and the Company appointing and 
training company mental health champions who will deliver mental 
health training to all employees;

• A programme whereby all first line supervisors within the business 

will complete a new, recently developed, Marshalls Health and Safety 
stage 2 training programme;

• The integration of CPM into the Marshalls Health and Safety 

Management system and culture; and

• The introduction of safety observations to all management teams 

across the business.

These initiatives will enhance the already high standard the Company 
demands in Health and Safety and take it to a completely new level. 

Equality and diversity
The ability to recruit, retain and develop the right people is fundamental 
to the future success of the business. The Company believes that attracting 
a suitably diverse range of individuals with the appropriate skills and 
experience will help us to achieve its goals.

As such, the Group has policies that promote equality and diversity and 
is committed to providing equal opportunities to employees and potential 
employees irrespective of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, disability 
or religious beliefs. The Company opposes all forms of discrimination and 
reinforces this through communication, awareness training and policy.

Employees
The Company continues to be a “Living Wage Employer”, underscoring 
its commitment to fairness and integrity towards our employees. Our 
recruitment policies are geared towards giving full and fair consideration 
towards creating a more diverse workforce and it is clear that there 
is much to be done in making the Company more attractive to both 

We also welcome and give full and fair consideration to applications 
from persons with recognised disabilities, providing equal opportunities 
for promotion and development and making adjustments to ensure 
that such individuals are not disadvantaged in the workplace.

Employee engagement and development
Improving employee engagement throughout the Group continues to be 
an important priority in order for the business to deliver on its strategy and 
objectives as well as providing a fulfilling and rewarding place of work for our 
people. Initiatives to improve this included various charitable events across 
the Group raising in total over £100,000 for our nominated charity, MIND. 
The business also used the “Best Companies“ framework to conduct another 
employee survey across all of the Group during 2017, achieving a response 
rate of 70 per cent. This will have been the fifth survey of this type as we 
continue to strive to improve our working environments and capture the 
valuable feedback from our employees and devise improvement plans 
as a result. The Company operates Sharesave and share purchase plans 
to encourage employee participation in the Company’s success.

The engagement programme is supported by an annual Group-wide 
communication “roadshow“ programme of senior management visits 
travelling around the business with the objective of meeting as many of 
our employees as possible face to face. This provides the Directors and 
senior management team with an unparalleled opportunity to explain 
to our employees how the business is performing, how our strategy is 
working, and what the priorities and objectives are, as well as providing 
information of concern to employees generally, taking soundings on 
employee views and answering questions in an open forum.

As a business, we are committed to investing in our employees. The 
ongoing training and development of our employees to develop our 
future managers and leaders is of major importance to the business. 
There is a range of online learning programmes accessible to all employees, 
and, in addition, to the management training programme for our first 
line managers, in which over 100 employees have now participated, we 
have added an additional 3 management development programmes. 
These programmes are geared towards emerging and middle management 
and facilitated through the University of Salford, Ashridge Business 
School and Cranfield School of Management.

We also continue to try and make our organisation an attractive place of 
work for young people through our ongoing apprenticeship programmes. 
We now have a good mix of apprenticeships spanning everything from 
engineering through to 4 year apprenticeships in areas such as marketing 
and Information Systems. We will continue to build on these schemes to 
increase our intake in 2018 and widen the range of options for prospective 
employees. We have strong community connections, particularly in 
locations near our offices and factories, and we plan to develop closer 
relations with local schools and colleges in order to encourage young 
people into the industry as well as the business.

Good progress has been made in the year with the development of our 
new HR system platform which will improve our operational efficiency 
and reliability of data in personnel and payroll administration. This, in 
conjunction with our project on job evaluation, will ensure that we are 
in a position to facilitate better decision making and create a more 
transparent system for the equal treatment of employees.

The system will also serve as the foundation to develop our future people 
strategy and complement our wider Group objectives through improved 
resource planning, performance management, recruitment and talent 
development initiatives with a view to ensuring that we attract and retain 
the best people in an open and fair way.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEDear Shareholder
This Corporate Governance Statement, together with 
the Reports of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees on pages 42 to 63, explains how Marshalls’ 
governance framework works and how we apply the 
principles of business integrity, high ethical values and 
professionalism in all our activities. As a Board, we recognise 
that we are accountable to shareholders for good corporate 
governance, and we seek to promote consistently high 
standards of governance throughout the Group that are 
recognised and understood by all.
Good governance
Good governance depends on good and effective leadership and a 
healthy corporate culture, supported by robust systems and processes 
and a good understanding of risk and risk appetite. Your Board has 
continued throughout the year to engage with shareholders and 
other stakeholders, to maintain constructive dialogue and challenge 
and to focus on strategy and value. As a Board, we keep abreast 
of developments in good governance and practice and participated 
in the Hampton-Alexander report on gender balance in 2017 as well as 
providing a detailed submission to the Government’s consultation on 
its Green Paper on Corporate Governance published in November 2016. 
The outcome of these and other initiatives are expected to lead to 
greater transparency and responsible corporate behaviour, which we 
fully support. The Board and the Executive Committee spent time on 
evaluating Marshalls’ culture and values, recognising that a healthy 
corporate culture will both protect and generate value. The Board has a 
leading role in fostering and influencing the positive culture and values 
of the Group by ensuring a consistency of approach and message from 
the top. The work of our Board Committees, explained in this report, 
demonstrates our commitment to openness and accountability, 
acknowledging the value of diversity and good succession planning, 
how we align reward with our values and strategy and how as an 
organisation we seek to embed our values across the business, 
while also recognising that there is further work to do.
Board evaluation
During 2017, the Board carried out an evaluation of its performance led by 
the Company Secretary and the Chairman. This concluded that the Board 
composition continued to be appropriate for the business, with a good 
balance of skills and experience, ensuring a well balanced and effective 
Board with a clear and inclusive strategy and a high degree of respect and 
trust at individual and collective level. The summary of our 2017 objectives, 
how we performed against them, and the objectives we have set for 2018 
following the 2017 evaluation process, appears on the first page of this report. 
These priorities are closely linked to the strategic objectives of the business.

Diversity
Marshalls’ policy is that no employee or job applicant will be treated less 
favourably on the grounds of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, 
gender (including gender reassignment), pregnancy, marital or civil partner 
status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age or disability, or on any other 
grounds which cannot be justified on job-related terms. We do not 
discriminate on grounds of age, gender or background, and we are 
committed to equality within our business and in our dealings with other 
organisations. These policy principles are supported by our Code of Conduct. 

The Board is committed to achieving diversity in the widest sense. 
We ensure that briefs to external recruitment agencies and search 
consultants are aimed at improving diversity ratios and balance both 
at Board and senior management level and more widely within the 
business, while also reflecting the changing strategic needs of the 
Group. We will continue to support positively opportunities for talented 
individuals regardless of gender, ethnicity, age or social background. 

As a Board, we are fully engaged with the initiatives within the business 
in this area, although we recognise that there is much work to do to 
achieve true gender balance and greater diversity. The Remuneration 
Report contains details of our gender ratios and gender pay gap data 
(pages 58 and 59), and the Nomination Committee report (pages 42 
and 43) explains in more detail how we implement our policy and 
how we aim to achieve improvements.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
This Corporate Governance Statement, which is part of the Directors’ 
Report, has been prepared in accordance with the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in April 2016 (the “Code”), but also 
recognises the recommendations in the FRC’s proposed new Corporate 
Governance Code expected to come into force from January 2019. 
The Company is supportive of the changes that will result from the 
application of that new Code. The Board has carried out a review of how 
the Code principles have been applied, together with the processes and 
procedures adopted by the Company to support the Code. The Board 
considers that the Company has complied with the relevant provisions 
of the Code throughout the year in all material respects. I can also 
confirm that in the opinion of the Directors these Annual Financial 
Statements present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Group’s position and prospects and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. The respective responsibilities of the 
Directors and the Auditor in connection with the Financial Statements 
are explained in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities and the 
Auditor’s Report on pages 44 to 45 and 66 to 71 respectively.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCECorporate Governance Statement continued

Role of the Board
The Board currently comprises an Independent Non-Executive 
Chairman, 3 Non-Executive Directors and 2 Executive Directors who 
are equally responsible for the proper stewardship and leadership 
of the Company. Their biographical details are on pages 34 and 35.

Among the written Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board, 
which is reviewed annually, are:

• approving and monitoring progress of strategy, business plans 

and budgets;

• approving any changes to capital, constitution or 

corporate structure;

• approving the annual and half-yearly accounts, and the approval 

and monitoring of the internal financial control system, risk 
management, health and safety and anti-bribery policies 
and procedures;

• Board appointments and succession planning, and setting 

Terms of Reference for Board Committees;

• approving transactions of significant value or major strategic 

importance; and

• remuneration matters, including major changes to pension 
schemes, the introduction of share and incentive schemes, 
and the general framework of remuneration.

The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. The Audit Committee Report 
on pages 46 to 49 provides details of how the Board applies the Code in 
relation to financial reporting, risk management and internal controls. The 
Nomination Committee Report on pages 42 and 43 reports on the work 
done, particularly in relation to Board and senior management succession 
planning, diversity and Board development. The Remuneration Report on 
pages 50 to 63 gives details of how the Group’s Remuneration Policy has 
been implemented, and of Directors’ remuneration for 2017. It also 
includes details of gender pay and balance. Other Board Committees are 
established periodically for particular purposes. For example, during the 
year, Board Committees were established to approve the acquisition 
of CPM Group Limited as well as the preliminary and half-yearly results.

Day-to-day management and the implementation of strategies agreed 
by the Board are delegated to the Executive Directors. The Group’s 
reporting structure below Board level is designed so that all decisions are 
made by the most appropriate people in a timely manner. Management 
teams report to members of the Executive Committee; this currently 
consists of 7 senior managers, including the 2 Executive Directors. The 
Board receives regular updates from the Executive Committee in relation 
to business issues and developments. These policies and procedures 
collectively enable the Board to make informed decisions on a range 
of key issues including strategy and risk management. The charts below 
show the frequency of how Board meetings, and the Board interacts 
with the Executive and the business.

The Board met 7 times in full session during 2017. In addition, the Audit 
Committee met 4 times, the Remuneration Committee met 5 times and 
the Nomination Committee met twice during the year. There were also 
Board Committee meetings in connection with the issue of financial 
results and the acquisition of CPM Group Limited.

The Chief Executive and the Finance Director are usually invited to 
attend Audit Committee meetings, although the Audit Committee also 
meets the auditor without any Executive Director being present. The 
Chief Executive is invited to attend Remuneration Committee meetings 
where appropriate. The Company Secretary is also Secretary to the 
Board Committees and attends meetings for this purpose.

Mark Edwards retired from the Board in May 2017 and attended all meetings 
up to the date of his retirement. Graham Prothero attended all meetings 
after the date of his appointment. In 2018 there are 7 Board, 4 Audit 
Committee and 4 Remuneration Committee meetings scheduled, with 
an additional day set aside for strategy. There are two scheduled 
Nomination Committee meetings and others will be arranged as necessary 
in relation to new Board appointments. Outside this formal Board schedule, 
Board members are expected to participate in site visits, and are invited to 
other events such as the Group’s two-day annual management conference.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCERoles of the Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Non‑Executive Directors
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive, each of whom has annually reviewed written Terms of 
Reference. The Chairman leads the Board and sets its agenda, ensuring 
that adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items, in 
particular strategic issues, making sure all Directors, particularly the 
Non-Executive Directors, are able to contribute, and maintaining a 
constructive relationship between the Executive and the Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chief Executive has responsibility for all operational 
matters which include the implementation of strategy and policies 
approved by the Board.

The Senior Independent Director, who also has written Terms of 
Reference, is responsible for providing a sounding board for the 
Chairman and is an intermediary for other Non-Executive Directors. 
She is available to shareholders if they have concerns which are not 
resolved through the normal channels of contact.

The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors were independent 
on appointment, and the Board considers each of the Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent in character and judgement in accordance 
with the principles of the Code.

At least once a year the Chairman holds a meeting with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors being present. 
The Non-Executive Directors also meet annually without the Chairman 
being present to appraise the Chairman’s performance.

Directors are able to ensure that any concerns they raise about the 
running of the Company or a proposed action are recorded in the 
Board minutes. If a Non-Executive Director did have any such 
concerns on resignation the Chairman would invite that Director 
to provide a written statement for circulation to the Board.
Conflicts of interest
The Board has adopted procedures for the authorisation of existing 
situations and for considering (and authorising where appropriate) 
new situations which may give rise to a conflict of interest. These are 
recorded in a Conflicts Register, reviewed by the Nomination Committee 
at least annually. Currently, the only situations authorised are the 
holding by Directors of directorships or similar offices with companies 
or organisations not connected with the Company where the Board 
has not identified any actual conflict of interest. The Board has reviewed 
the procedures and is satisfied that they are operating effectively.

Board composition, commitment and election of Directors
The Nomination Committee leads the process for Board appointments 
and makes recommendations to the Board. We believe our Board is of 
sufficient size and has an appropriate balance of skills and experience to 
meet the needs of the business. Individual Director evaluations, 
succession planning and the work of the Nomination Committee are 
commented on further in the Nomination Committee Report.

On appointment, Board members, in particular the Chairman and the 
Non-Executive Directors, disclose their other commitments and agree to 
allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their duties 
effectively and ensure that these other commitments do not affect their 
contribution. The current Board commitments of the Chairman and of 
the remaining members of the Board are shown on pages 34 and 35. 
Any conflicts of interest are dealt with in accordance with the Board 
conflicts procedures.

The Company’s Articles of Association contain powers of removal, 
appointment, election and re-election of Directors and provide that at 
least one-third of the Board must retire at each Annual General Meeting 
and each Director must retire by rotation every 3 years. In practice, the 
Company requires all Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors 
to stand for re-election at each Annual General Meeting. All Directors 
except Andrew Allner will stand for re-election or election at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting. The terms of appointment of the current 
Directors and the Directors’ biographical details on pages 34 and 35 
show their length of service on the Board.
Board induction, development and support
New Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining 
the Board. There is an induction pack for new Directors incorporating 
the Company’s constitutional and governance documents, Group 
policies and other key information, and training is provided on the use 
of our active “virtual boardroom“ board reporting tools. During 2017, 
Non-Executive Directors were trained to carry out site safety inspections 
as part of the Group’s health and safety programme. Other tailored 
training may be arranged to meet individual needs, for example to 
update knowledge of developments in regulatory compliance. Typically, 
a new Director will meet the Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors in one-on-one sessions; he or she will have meetings with key 
management, briefings with external advisers and shareholders, and a 
programme of site visits will be arranged at which the Director meets 
site-based staff to gain a full understanding of the business.

Case study
Induction of Graham Prothero to the Board
Graham held one-to-one meetings with all Directors and the Company Secretary as part 
of his recruitment and induction. On appointment he received a detailed information pack 
containing relevant constitutional documents, key policies and procedures, essential 
Company facts and a corporate history and contact details.

A comprehensive programme of site visits and meetings with key advisers was arranged for 
Graham throughout 2017. By December, he had been to a number of key operating sites 
and had held meetings with auditors, internal auditors and the Company’s City advisers.

Commenting on his induction, Graham said: “The process was very thorough and gave me 
an excellent introduction to the Company. I was impressed by the support given by the 
executive team and their staff and the warm welcome from my Board colleagues."

CORPORATE GOVERNANCECorporate Governance Statement continued

Case study
Linking governance and operational 
strategy: Acquisition of CPM
•  The Board commissioned an external review of value-enhancing 

acquisition targets in 2015, and management followed this up 
with exploratory discussions designed to nurture good relations 
with certain prospective target businesses. When management 
considered the time was right, supported by a strong business case,
the proposal to pursue formal discussions with the shareholders 
of CPM Group Limited was tabled for Board consideration 
in early 2017.

•  Board presentations were reviewed in both June and August 2017, 
during which the Board challenged and scrutinised the rationale for
the proposed acquisition to ensure it was in line with the Group’s 
strategy and would be value enhancing.

•  The Board authorised a Board Committee to approve heads of 
terms and commence detailed due diligence in July 2017 and 
PwC and Herbert Smith Freehills were commissioned to provide
financial and legal advice in connection with the acquisition.

•  The Board considered detailed due diligence reports covering all 

aspects of CPM’s business (including financial, legal, property, health 
and safety, IT, procurement, sales and operations) and held meetings
with the project teams. The Board review covered various issues, 
including funding, risk analysis, expected returns and the 
post-acquisition integration plan.

•  Having concluded its investigation and negotiated the detailed

terms of the acquisition, the Board approved management’s 
recommendation to acquire CPM on 18 October 2017, and the 
acquisition was completed on 19 October 2017.

Board induction, development and support continued
Directors are expected to attend external courses and seminars as 
appropriate to maintain and develop their Board competencies. Training 
is also built into the annual Board programme, which is designed to cover 
a range of topics of particular relevance to the business. During 2017, 
there were Board briefings relating to health and safety and the Board 
also received senior management presentations in relation to customer 
initiatives, developments in HR, manufacturing operations and the Group’s 
marketing strategy. Non-Executive Directors took the opportunity to meet 
senior managers to discuss areas of particular interest. Training needs 
are identified through the Board evaluation process and through the 
individual one-to-one reviews between the Directors and the Chairman.

Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
and are entitled to rely on the impartial and independent nature of that 
advice and those services. The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring 
that Board procedures are complied with and, through the Chairman, advises 
the Board on corporate governance matters. Both the appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary are matters for the Board as a whole.

The Board has an approved procedure for all Directors to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. Board Committees are 
provided with sufficient resources to undertake their duties, including 
the option to appoint external advisers when they deem it appropriate.
Indemnities and insurance
The Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to 
cover legal proceedings against its Directors and Officers acting in that 
capacity. The Group has also granted indemnities to its Directors to the 
extent permitted by law (which are qualifying third party indemnities 
within the meaning of Section 236 of the Companies Act 2006), and 
these remained in force during the year in relation to certain losses and 
liabilities that the Directors may incur to third parties in the course of 
action as Directors or employees of the Company, any subsidiary or 
associated company, or as a Director of the pension scheme trustee 
board. Neither the liability insurance nor the indemnities provide cover 
in the event of proven fraudulent or dishonest activity.

Board evaluation
The Company carries out a full evaluation of Board performance and that 
of its 3 principal Committees annually. The independent assessment 
provided by Equity Communications in 2016 confirmed that the Board 
was working very effectively and that the internally-led Board evaluation 
process in previous years had been successful in improving Board 
effectiveness. Accordingly, the Board decided to return to an internal 
process for its 2017 evaluation, led by the Chairman and the Company 
Secretary. The evaluation was carried out using a questionnaire, followed 
by one-to-one interviews between each of the Directors and the 
Company Secretary. The questionnaire was designed to stimulate thought 
and discussion rather than to deliver scores, and included questions about 
the effectiveness of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and the 
performance of the Chairman. The Senior Independent Director separately 
reviewed the Chairman’s performance with other Non-Executive Directors. 
The results of the evaluation were then reviewed by the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary and discussed by the Board. The Board also reviewed 
progress against the priorities identified for 2017 from the 2016 evaluation 
process. The outcomes of the evaluation process and the themes that 
have emerged for focus in 2018 are highlighted on page 36.
How we assess our performance, prospects and viability
The Group has in place a comprehensive financial review process, 
including detailed annual budgets, business plans and regular 
forecasting. There are a range of performance indicators which are 
tracked by management on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, as 
appropriate, and addressed through a programme of operational 
meetings and action plans. All Directors receive regular and timely 
information to enable them to perform their duties, including 
information on the Group’s operational and financial performance, 
customer service, health and safety performance and forward trends. 

The Board reviews at each regular Board meeting the monthly financial 
results, taking account of performance indicators and the detailed 
annual business plan and budget. The Board also considers forward 
trends and performance against other key indicators, including areas 
where performance departs from forecasts, and contingency plans. 
The Board reviews and discusses medium and long-term strategy on a 
regular basis and meets at least annually with the Executive Committee 
to review strategy. It also holds separate meetings with individual 
members of senior management to ensure the Board receives regular 
updates on current business and strategic issues.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCECase study
Investor communications strategy
Marshalls’ investor communications strategy combines personal 
contact with integrated reporting through the IR website, regular 
presentations and the Annual Report. During 2017, 80 meetings were 
held with current or prospective shareholders, together with additional 
analyst meetings, investor roadshows and site visits. Marshalls 
continues to enhance and align all reporting channels focusing on 
strategy, key business drivers, risks and the investment case.

• Our main purpose is to articulate a clear corporate strategy in a 

way that is easy to understand;

• We seek to give a consistent message and style across all the 

communication channels;

In this way, the Board assesses the prospects of the Group using all 
the information at its disposal, and considering historic performance, 
forecast performance for the current year, and longer-term forecasts 
over the 3-year business planning cycle as appropriate. In approving 
these accounts the Board has considered these matters in detail in order 
to be able to give the Viability Statement on page 21. The Board has 
adopted the going concern basis in preparing these Financial Statements 
and has a reasonable expectation that the Group is able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 
12 months.
Risk management and internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for determining the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives, and for the Group’s system of internal control. The 
Board has during 2017 carried out a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal controls systems covering all 
material controls, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls. The Strategic Report comments in detail (pages 20 to 24) 
on the nature of the principal risks facing the Group, in particular those 
that would threaten our business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity and the measures in place to mitigate them. In conducting 
its review, the Board has included a robust assessment of these risks, 
particularly operational risks that might affect the assessment of the 
Group’s viability. The Board’s risk review also incorporates an element 
of stress testing, by envisaging scenarios that might arise during the 
financial year and / or the planning cycle, and considering, with financial 
impact modelling where appropriate, the likely effect in the business 
and its prospects. The Audit Committee Report on pages 46 to 49 
describes the internal control system and how it is managed and 
monitored. The Board acknowledges that such systems are designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material mis-statement or loss.
Relations with shareholders
The Board places great emphasis on good communications with 
shareholders. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director meet regularly 
with major shareholders to discuss the Group’s performance, strategic 
issues and shareholder investment objectives, and also periodically 
arrange site visits for investors. Reports of these meetings and any 
shareholder communications during the year are provided to the Board. 
During 2017, 80 such meetings were held, at which 75 per cent of the 
Group’s institutional shareholders were represented. This approach 
ensures the views of major shareholders are understood by all Directors.

• There is an emphasis on personal contact and individual dialogue 

– with significant time commitment for shareholder and 
investor meetings;

• We arrange regular analyst presentations and site visits;
• We have invested in Corporate Reporting in recent years – 
with particular focus on the Strategic Report and Corporate 
Governance Reporting;

• There are regular and consistent presentations to facilitate 

understanding and clarity of message;

• Results Presentation by CEO and CFO is filmed and available 

on the IR website;

•  We have re-designed and upgraded the Investor Relations website; and
• PR consultants (MHP Communications) provide ongoing support 

for the communications strategy.

The Board also regularly receives copies of analysts’ and brokers’ 
briefings. The Chairman is available to meet major shareholders on 
request to discuss governance and strategy. The Senior Independent 
Director is also available to meet shareholders separately if requested. 
When appropriate, the Non-Executive Directors attend meetings or site 
visits with major shareholders and would be available to meet major 
shareholders if a meeting were requested.

There is a regular reporting and announcement schedule to ensure 
that matters of importance affecting the Group are communicated to 
investors, and the Annual and Half-yearly Reports, together with the 
Marshalls website, are substantial means of communication with all 
shareholders during the year.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of Annual General Meeting is dispatched to shareholders, 
together with explanatory notes or a circular on items of special 
business, at least 20 working days before the meeting. It is the 
Company’s practice to propose separate resolutions on each substantially 
separate issue, including a resolution relating to the Report and 
Accounts, and to put all resolutions to an electronic poll at the Annual 
General Meeting. All Directors normally attend the meeting, including 
the Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, 
who are available to answer questions. The Board welcomes questions 
from shareholders who have an opportunity to raise issues informally 
or formally before or at the Annual General Meeting.

For each resolution the proxy appointment forms provide shareholders with 
the option to direct their proxy vote either for or against the resolution 
or to withhold their vote. The proxy form and any announcement of the 
results of a vote make it clear that a “vote withheld“ is not a vote in law 
and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes 
for and against the resolution.

All valid proxy appointments are properly recorded and counted. 
Information on the number of shares represented by proxy, the proxy 
votes for and against each resolution, and the number of shares in 
respect of which the vote was withheld for each resolution, together 
with the voting result, are given at the meeting and made available 
on the Company’s website.

Nomination Committee Report

Role of the Nomination Committee
The Board’s Nomination Committee fulfils a vital role in terms 
of succession planning and Board performance. Its Terms of 
Reference include:

• Board succession planning, including size, composition and 

balance of skills and experience, giving due weight to the 
achievement of diversity in its widest sense;

• recruitment and induction of candidates for appointment 

to the Board;

• reviewing individual performance evaluation outcomes for 

Directors standing for election or re-election in advance of the 
Annual General Meeting; and

• monitoring conflicts, reviewing the Board conflicts policy, 
maintaining the conflicts register and considering any new 
notifications.

The performance of the Committee was evaluated as part of the 
externally led Board evaluation process in 2017, and the 
Committee Terms of Reference were also reviewed.

During the year the Nomination Committee held two scheduled 
meetings, and additional meetings and discussions in connection 
with succession planning and recruitment were held by 
telephone. Attendance at meetings is shown on page 38.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEDear Shareholder
I am pleased to report to shareholders on the main activities 
of the Committee and how it has performed its duties 
during 2017, as well as commenting on the Committee’s 
role in the appointment of my successor as Chair of the 
Board. As current Chair, I also chair Nomination Committee 
meetings, except where the Committee is dealing with 
my own re-appointment or replacement as Chair.
Recruitment and succession planning
The philosophy of the Nomination Committee is that recruitment and 
succession planning should reflect the changing strategic needs and 
objectives of the Group, both now and in the future, as well as being 
an important factor in the development of a strong corporate culture. 
In this context, we are wholly committed to achieving diversity in its 
widest sense in the composition of the Board and senior management, 
and we welcome the increased focus on diversity from shareholders 
and other commentators. The Group’s policies are designed to support 
positively the widening of opportunity for talented individuals regardless 
of gender, ethnicity or social background. The Remuneration Report 
includes details of current gender ratios and some of the measures that 
have been taken in 2017 and that are planned in future to help achieve 
our objectives. These are disclosed on pages 58 and 59.

During 2017, the Committee reviewed its written succession plan 
and individual performance and development at Board level. Having 
concluded in 2016 that the composition and current Board size were 
appropriate, and that the range of skills and experience was well 
balanced, we were pleased to welcome Graham Prothero to the Board 
and as Audit Chair to succeed Mark Edwards in May 2017. Graham’s 
recruitment was carried out using the services of Lygon, who have no 
other connection with the Group, following a detailed and objective 
selection process. Graham is a valuable addition to the Board and the 
induction and handover process worked well. 

During 2017, the Committee also commenced the recruitment process 
for a new Board Chair. A competitive tender resulted in the appointment 
of The Inzito Partnership to support the process, who are not otherwise 
connected with the Group. The brief was clear on the need to take into 
account our commitments to inclusivity and diversity objectives both at 
Board and senior management level, as well as keeping a good balance 
and “fit" with the existing Board. The process has been led by Tim Pile 
and is well advanced, with a very strong field of candidates. We expect 
to conclude the selection and make an announcement very shortly. The 
Committee has also engaged with ongoing initiatives in the business as 
a whole to improve diversity ratios and gender balance, through 
meetings and discussions with management, monitoring progress and 
ensuring that these principles are followed in briefs to external 
recruitment agencies and search consultants.

Non-Executive Directors, including the Chair, are appointed for specific 
terms, subject to re-appointment and the Company’s Articles of 
Association and subject to the Companies Act provisions relating to 
the removal of a Director. The Committee’s framework for succession 
planning is designed to phase future recruitment so that the composition 
of the Board can be refreshed whilst ensuring continuity.
Re‑appointment of Directors
Each Non-Executive Director was, on joining, provided with a detailed 
description of his or her role and responsibilities, and received a detailed 
business induction. All Directors have an annual one-to-one development 
review meeting with the Chair to appraise performance, set personal 
objectives and discuss any development and training needs to enable 
them to continue to add value to the Board, with an assessment of 
individual and collective performance with contributions from senior 
management and other business stakeholders.

Before any Director is proposed for re-election, or has their appointment 
renewed, the Committee considers the outcome of these reviews to 
ensure that the Director continues to be effective and demonstrates 
commitment to the role. The Chair provides an explanation to shareholders 
as to why the Director should be re-elected and confirming that a 
formal performance evaluation has taken place when the resolution 
to re-elect is circulated.

It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors can only hold 1 
external listed company Non-Executive directorship. Voluntary service 
on the governing board of a social, trade or charitable organisation 
is also permitted. Details of the external appointments held by the 
Executive Directors are included in the biographical notes on pages 
34 and 35.

I expect to step down as Chair in May 2018, immediately following the 
AGM, at which time it is expected that my replacement will take office.
Governance
The Committee has acted in accordance with the principles of the 
Code in developing and applying its succession plans and policies. 
The Committee’s effectiveness, including the effective application 
of those principles, is assessed as part of the annual Board evaluation 
process. The framework for the refreshment of skills, experience and 
diversity to support the needs of the business and its stakeholders 
in the future is transparent and well understood.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEStatement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation, and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, 
including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:

• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 

and prudent;

• for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been 

prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

• for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether 

applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company Financial Statements; and

• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company 
will continue in business.

In preparing the Group Financial Statements, IAS 1 requires that Directors:

• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in 

a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;

• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 

requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and

• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 

a going concern.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.

Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that 
comply with that law and those regulations.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors on the annual 
financial report
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report and whose names and functions are listed on pages 34 and 35 
confirm that, to the best of each of their knowledge:

• the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 

set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 

• the Strategic Report contained in this Annual Report includes a fair 

review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and

• the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, 

is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

Disclosure of information to the auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware, 
and each Director has taken all the steps that he / she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself / herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is 
aware of that information.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEGoing concern
The Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these 
Financial Statements in accordance with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s “Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting”, issued in September 2014. The 
Directors considered that it was appropriate to do so, having reviewed 
any uncertainties that may affect the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern for at least the next 12 months from the date these 
Financial Statements were approved.
Cautionary statement and Directors’ liability
This Annual Report 2017 has been prepared for, and only for, the 
members of the Company, as a body, and no other persons. Neither the 
Company nor the Directors accept or assume any liability to any person 
to whom this Annual Report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
except to the extent that such liability arises and may not be excluded 
under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has 
demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or 
omission shall be determined in accordance with Section 90A of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements 
with respect to the Group’s financial condition, results, strategy, plans 
and objectives. These statements are not forecasts or guarantees of 
future performance and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate 
to events and depend upon circumstances that will occur in the future.

There are a number of factors that could cause actual results or 
developments to differ materially from those expressed, implied or 
forecast by these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking 
statements in this Annual Report are based on information known to 
the Group as at the date of this Annual Report and the Group has no 
obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information or future events. Nothing in this 
Annual Report should be construed as a profit forecast.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice convening the Annual General Meeting to be held at 
the Holiday Inn, Clifton Village, Brighouse HD6 4HW at 11.00 am on 
Wednesday 9 May 2018, together with explanatory notes on the 
resolutions to be proposed, is contained in a circular to be sent to

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEDear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my first report as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. In this report I set out the 
Audit Committee’s objectives and responsibilities and also 
explain the activities undertaken during 2017 and the 
priorities for 2018. This report, which is part of the Directors’ 
Report, explains how the Audit Committee has discharged 
its responsibilities during 2017.

The role of the Audit Committee is to oversee financial reporting and 
to review the ongoing effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. 
The Committee provides assurance on the Group’s risk management 
processes and assesses information received from the external and 
internal audit functions. This report explains the Group’s procedures in 
relation to internal control, risk management and financial reporting.

KPMG LLP, who were appointed as internal auditors in 2015, conducted 
8 separate detailed reviews during 2017 and reported to the Committee 
with recommendations, all of which have been implemented or will 
be implemented during the coming year. One of our key priorities 
remains to monitor the risk management and control environment, 
ensuring that it aligns with best practice and that any improvements 
are implemented in a timely and efficient way. Cyber security continued 
to be a key priority and other areas of focus for the Committee are 
provided in this report.

The Committee has reviewed the Group’s Financial Statements 
contained in this Annual Report and, following its review, is satisfied that 
the Committee has provided assurance to the Board that they present a 
fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position 
and prospects.
How the Audit Committee operates
During the year, the Audit Committee held 4 formal meetings and there 
were also meetings between the Audit Committee Chairman, the 
Finance Director and the external auditor. 

The Committee meets both the external and internal auditor 
independently of management, giving the opportunity to ensure that it 
has full visibility of matters that have been the subject of particular 
discussions. The Committee also reports to the Board in relation to the 
going concern statement and the viability statement and whether the 
accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.

Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
During the year an internal evaluation of the Committee’s performance 
was undertaken as part of the Board evaluation process. The review 
found the Committee to be effective and well run. No areas of concern 
were highlighted during this review. 

The Chairman of the Committee is a Chartered Accountant and the 
Board is satisfied he is independent and has recent and relevant 
financial experience as required by the Code. Other members also have 
relevant sectoral and financial experience. Their biographical details are 
on pages 34 and 35, and attendance at meetings is shown on page 38. 
Financial reporting
The Committee has reviewed, with both management and the external 
auditor, where the more significant judgements have been made and 
the quality and appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies. 
The Committee has also reviewed the assumptions and provided 
assurance to support the long-term viability statement.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the system 
of risk management and control, and for ensuring that it continues 
to meet the necessary standards. The systems and controls are also 
subject to a regular rolling programme of review, the results of which 
are periodically reported to the Board. 

The Group’s Risk Committee, comprising the Executive Directors and 
members of senior management with Executive accountability for 
particular risk areas, meets at least twice yearly to identify, evaluate 
and consider steps to manage any material risks which might 
threaten the Group’s business objectives. 

The Group has an established internal control framework, the 
key features of which include clearly defined reporting lines and 
authorisation procedures and a comprehensive budget and monthly 
reporting system. The internal control framework governs the internal 
financial reporting process of the business, with checks and balances 
built into the system that are designed to reduce the likelihood of 
material error or fraud. 

Within the internal control framework, policies and procedures are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. During the year, a more formal process 
has been adopted for the ongoing assessment of operational financial 
and IT based controls. The overriding objective is to gain assurance that 
the control framework is complete and that individual controls are 
operating effectively. A rolling programme of independent internal 
checking of key controls and reconciliations has been established 
during the year. This programme includes key controls over access 
and change permissions on base data and metadata.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEAudit Committee Report continued

Significant issues related to the Financial Statements
When reviewing the annual and half-yearly results, the Committee 
exercises its judgement in relation to matters drawn to its 
attention by the Finance Director from the internal audit function, 
the Risk Committee and the Group’s external auditor. The 
significant areas considered by the Committee for 2017 were:

•        The risk of management override of controls – 
management’s assessment of the control framework 
including authorisation controls and segregation of duties. 
The Committee considered those areas where management 
applies judgement in determining the appropriate accounting 
and discussed this with the external auditor. The external 
auditor presented its findings with regard to the audit testing of 
journals to the Committee. This testing included the use of data 
analytics to profile the entire journal population.

•  Inventory provisioning – management’s assessment of the

appropriate level of provisioning against inventory obsolescence. 
The gross levels of finished goods inventory held and the provisions 
recorded against obsolescence and in respect of items that might 
be sold at lower than cost were reviewed by the Committee. The 
review included meetings with operational management to discuss
the inventory provisioning strategy. The external auditor presented 
its findings with regard to the audit testing over inventory 
valuation and the Committee concurred with management’s 
assessment of the carrying value of Group inventories. 

•  Acquisition accounting in relation to the purchase of CPM

– management’s assessment of the appropriate accounting 
treatment and the exercise of judgement in the identification 
and valuation of intangible assets within the acquired business. 
The Committee considered those areas where management 
applied judgement in delivering the appropriate accounting 
treatment and discussed this with the external auditor. 
The external auditor presented its findings with regards 
to the audit work undertaken to assess this area. 

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee has considered whether, in its opinion, the 2017 
Annual Report and Financial Statements is, taken as a whole, 
fair, balanced and understandable, and whether it provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy. In making this 
assessment, the Committee has advised the Board in relation to 
the statement required by the UK Corporate Governance Code.

The Committee has concluded that the disclosures, and the process 
and controls underlying their production, were appropriate 
to enable it to determine that the 2017 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements are fair, balanced and understandable.

Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee has carried out an assessment of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control system, covering all 
material controls including its financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems for the year to 31 December 2017.

The Group maintains a written Risk Register that identifies the Group’s 
key risk areas, the probability of these risks occurring and the impact 
they would have on the Group. Against each risk, the effectiveness of 
the controls that exist to manage and, where possible, minimise or 
eliminate those risks are also listed. The Risk Register process identifies 
areas for action and independent audit assessment in order to test the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk control systems. Information relating 
to the management of risks and any changes to the assessment of key 
risks is regularly reported to the Board, and the Risk Register is updated 
to reflect changes. To the extent that any failings or weaknesses are 
identified during the review process, appropriate measures are taken 
to remedy these. The key risks affecting the Group, how they relate 
to strategy and how they changed during the year, together with a 
description of the controls and mitigation associated with such risks, 
are highlighted in the Strategic Review on pages 20 to 24.
External audit, auditor independence and objectivity
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making a 
recommendation to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment 
and removal of the external auditor. It keeps under review the scope 
and results of the audit, its cost effectiveness and the independence 
and objectivity of the auditor. The Group’s current auditor, Deloitte LLP, 
has processes in place designed to maintain independence, including 
regular rotation of the audit partner. Deloitte LLP was appointed 
in May 2015 as statutory auditor following a tender process, and 
Christopher Robertson has acted as audit partner since the appointment 
of Deloitte LLP as auditor in May 2015. The Company has complied with 
the Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year 
under review. 

48

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEThe Committee has adopted policies to safeguard the independence 
of its external auditor. It is the policy of the Company that the external 
auditor should not provide non-audit services other than those of a “de 
minimis“ value of less than £5,000 in aggregate in any financial year. Any 
other non-audit services, require the specific approval of the Committee. 
Where the Committee perceives that the independence of the auditor 
could be compromised, the work will not be awarded to the external 
auditor. Details of amounts paid to the external auditor for audit and 
non-audit services in 2017 are analysed in Note 3 on page 89. Other 
than the auditor’s Half-yearly review of Marshalls plc, no amounts were 
paid for non-audit work. The aggregate amount paid to other firms 
of accountants for non-audit services in the same period was £368,000 
(2016: £245,000).
Internal audit
The Committee has responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of 
internal controls and reviews these on an ongoing basis. The internal 
audit process of reviewing and reporting on the internal control system 
is carried out by KPMG LLP, appointed by the Committee in 2015 to act 
as internal auditor for the Group. The annual internal audit programme 
is derived from a risk-based assessment that takes into account the Risk 
Register and management input. This risk-based assessment is reviewed 
and approved by the Audit Committee. This process is overseen by the 
Finance Director. KPMG LLP are independent from the Company’s 
external auditor and have no other connection with the Group.

The Company operates a self-certification internal control process 
to support the internal audit process throughout the year. The internal 
audit programme includes both regular audit checks and assignments 
to look at areas of critical importance. These assignments form part 
of a much wider programme of independently audited aspects of the 
Group’s operations. Any areas of weakness that are identified through 
this process prompt a detailed action plan and a follow-up audit check 
to establish that actions have been completed. Instances of fraud or 
attempted fraud (if any) and preventative action plans are also reported 
to the Committee and recorded in a fraud register.

During the year, in addition to the regular internal control process, KPMG 
LLP conducted specific reviews on cyber security risk and the policies 
and procedures in operation to manage the supply chain. Other reviews 
included reviews in relation to taxation, budget procedures and GDPR.

The Committee is pleased to report that, although the wider risk of 
cyber fraud continues to increase, no significant failings or weaknesses 
were identified during the year. There were no incidences of fraud 
that significantly affected the Group’s business during 2017. A rolling 
programme of cyber security awareness training is undertaken and 
external presentations were made to selected groups of employees 
by specialists from the Group’s banking partners. 

Effectiveness of the external audit
An annual review of external audit effectiveness was undertaken 
by the Committee in 2017. The conclusion of the review was that 
the external auditor had conducted a comprehensive, appropriate 
and effective audit. Communication, at all levels, had been open 
and constructive and areas where the external auditor could work 
more effectively, in respect of each phase of the audit, were identified. 

Effectiveness of the internal audit
An annual review of internal audit effectiveness and of the 
performance of KPMG LLP as independent internal auditor was 
undertaken by the Committee in 2017.

The conclusion was very positive and was that the current internal 
audit process continues to be an efficient and effective means of 
managing the internal audit function. The Committee has considered, 
with KPMG LLP, how this process can be developed further and 
further improvements have been reflected in the 2018 plan.

Whistleblowing and bribery
The Audit Committee monitors any reported incidents under the 
Serious Concerns Policy (our whistleblowing policy), which is available 
to all employees. This policy is displayed on operating site noticeboards 
and on the Company’s intranet, and sets out the procedure for 
employees to raise legitimate concerns about any wrongdoing without 
fear of criticism, discrimination or reprisal. The Serious Concerns Policy 
was reviewed during the year and the Committee was satisfied that 
arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent 
investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action.

The Audit Committee also takes responsibility for reviewing the 
policies and procedures adopted by the Company to prevent bribery. 
The Company is committed to a zero-tolerance position with regard to 
bribery, made explicit through its Anti-Bribery Code and supporting 
guidance for its employees, agents and contractors on hospitality and 
gifts. The policy and procedures are published on the Company website 
and displayed on operating site noticeboards. Online training is available 
to all employees via the Group’s internal learning zone to reinforce 
the Anti-Bribery Code and procedures, and classroom-based training 
sessions are also held throughout the year. All employees in decision-
making roles with potential exposure to bribery risk have completed 
the training and must self-certify annually that they continue to comply. 
There is a maintained register of employee interests and a gifts and 
hospitality record. The internal audit review programme included a 
review of the adequacy of the Company’s procedures in relation to 
the prevention of bribery, and recommendations from the internal audit 
process have been implemented. 

The Audit Committee Report has been approved by the Board and 
signed on its behalf by:

support the Group’s initiatives on strategy, diversity and the 
strengthening of values and culture.        

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEDear Shareholder
I am writing to you as the Chair of Marshalls’ Remuneration 
Committee and am pleased to set out in this report how the 
Committee has carried out its objectives and responsibilities 
during 2017. 

This report is divided into two; an introduction and “at a glance“ summary 
of our activities and our Annual Remuneration Report, showing how our 
Policy was applied during the year and outcomes for our executives.
Wider workforce considerations
Marshalls is committed to creating an inclusive working environment and to 
rewarding our employees throughout the organisation in a fair manner. In 
making decisions on executive pay, the Remuneration Committee considers 
wider workforce remuneration and conditions. We believe that employees 
throughout the Company should be able to share in the success of the 
Company and, in 2015, we introduced a tax advantaged Save-As-You-Earn 
plan for this purpose. We also believe that employees should have the 
opportunity to save for their futures and to this end we introduced a 
new defined contribution scheme during 2017. This provides a much 
improved pension savings mechanism for all employees. We are proud to 
be a Living Wage Employer and believe that fair working conditions should 
extend throughout not just our own organisation but also along our supply 
chain. Marshalls has worked closely with external organisations to evaluate 
our business and supply chain against the principles now embodied in the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015 to eliminate slavery in all its forms. 

As part of our commitment to fairness, we have introduced a new section 
to this report (see pages 58 and 59) which sets out more information on 
our wider workforce pay conditions, our CEO to employee pay ratio, our 
gender pay statistics and our diversity initiatives. Whilst we recognise there 
is much work still to do, we believe that transparency is an important first 
step towards making improvements in relation to these issues.
Board changes
The Committee was delighted to welcome its newest member, Graham 
Prothero, following the 2017 AGM. Graham brings a wealth of insight 
from his experience in professional services and, more recently, as Group 
CFO of Galliford Try plc. 
Shareholders 
I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support during 
the year. I will be available at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 
9 May 2018 to answer any questions in relation to this Remuneration Report.

External advisers
The Company has appointed external remuneration advisers, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”). PwC attends meetings of the 
Committee by invitation. The Chief Executive attends as appropriate 
but may not participate in discussions about his own remuneration. 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee and attends 
Committee meetings.

PwC’s fees are agreed by the Remuneration Committee according to 
the work performed. The terms of engagement are available on request 
from the Company Secretary. PwC also provided advice to the Group 
during the year in relation to the DC pension scheme reforms and the 
acquisition of CPM Group Limited. The Committee is satisfied that the 
advice from PwC is independent based on the separation of the team 
advising the Committee from any other work undertaken by PwC and 
the fact that PwC is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group’s 
Code of Conduct. PwC’s work relating to Executive remuneration during 
2017 included: assistance in the preparation of the Remuneration 
Committee Report; the triennial review of Remuneration Policy; 
benchmarking of total remuneration in respect of the Company and its 
comparator group; and general advice on remuneration trends, 
regulations and best practice. The amount paid to PwC in respect of 
remuneration advice received during 2017 was £40,000 (2016: £25,000).

Our Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2008 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. It also meets the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and 
Disclosure and Transparency rules.

2016 / 17 single figure 
The following charts summarise the single figure of remuneration for 2017 in comparison with 2016 and with the minimum, target and maximum 
remuneration scenarios from the 2017 Remuneration Policy to show how the actual remuneration compares to the Policy remuneration. For those elements 
of remuneration provided in shares in 2016 and 2017, we have separated out their original value on grant and the additional value generated due to share 
price growth over the vesting period. It is the Committee’s view that one of the key objectives of equity based remuneration is to align executives’ interests 
and those of shareholders. The increase in value of awards due to share price growth over the vesting periods is another demonstration of this alignment. 

Explanatory notes on the single figure can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration (page 60).

Remuneration, equity and reward of the Executive Directors
It is the Committee’s view that it is important when considering the remuneration paid in the year under the single figure to take a holistic view of 
the Director’s total reward linked to the performance of the Company. In the Committee’s opinion, the impact on the total reward of the Director is 
more important than the single figure in any one year. This approach encourages Directors to take a long-term view of the sustainable performance 
of the Company, which is critical in a cyclical business. The ability for the Directors to gain and lose, dependent on the share price performance of 
the Company, at a level which is material to their total remuneration is a key facet of the Company’s Remuneration Policy.

Salary and benefits
Base salary recognises the market value of the Executive’s role, skills, 
responsibilities, performance and experience.

Typically, the base salaries of Executive Directors in post at the start of the 
Policy period and who remain in the same role throughout the Policy period 
will be increased by a similar percentage to the average annual percentage 
increase in salaries of all other employees in the Group. Benefits include 
company car / allowance, private medical cover and health screening.

Pension
To enable Executive Directors to make appropriate provision for retirement.

MIP Element A
Enabling the successful implementation of Group strategy through setting 
relevant annual targets to measure Executive Director performance. Aligns 
the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders and contributes to the 
retention of key individuals by ensuring that Executive Directors take part of 
their annual bonus in shares or share-linked units rather than cash.

Upon assessment of performance by the Committee, a contribution will be 
made by the Company into the participant’s plan account and 50 per cent 
of the cumulative balance will be paid in cash. Any remaining balance will 
be converted into shares or share-linked units.

100 per cent of the balance in the final year of the plan will normally be paid 
in shares to the participant. During the plan period, 50 per cent of the 
retained balance is at risk of forfeiture based on a minimum threshold level 
of performance determined annually by the Committee.

MIP Element B
To promote long-term shareholding in the Company and strengthen 
alignment between interests of Executive Directors and those of shareholders.

To link variable pay to achievement of annual financial and business objectives.

Awards are made annually in shares. Awards normally vest after three years, 
subject to continued employment.

Once vested (net of tax), the shares may not be sold for a further 2 years.

There is a minimum threshold which, if not achieved at the end of the 3 year 
vesting period, results in the forfeiture of up to 50 per cent of unvested awards.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEHow we implemented the policy in 2017

How we will implement the policy in 2018

Executive Director salaries for 2017 were 
as follows:

A salary increase of 3.5 per cent will be applied at the salary review date. From 1 January 2018, 
Executive Director salaries will be:

CEO – £430,000

CFO – £282,000

CEO – £445,000

CFO – £292,000

Salary increases were 2 per cent in 2017, in 
line with inflation and increases for UK 
employees generally.

The general employee base salary increase was 3.5 per cent from 1 January 2018.

The maximum Company contribution or 
pension allowance is 20 per cent of salary.

No change. 

Maximum opportunity in 2017 was 
as follows:

CEO – 150 per cent of base salary

CFO – 150 per cent of base salary

The performance measures were:

EPS (75 per cent);

operating cash flow (25 per cent); and

non-financial targets (which, if not met, 
result in a 10 per cent deduction for each 
missed target from amount earned under 
financial measures).

The outcome level for 2017 was as follows:

CEO – 100 per cent award

CFO – 100 per cent award

The performance measures are the same for 
Element A and Element B in 2017. 

No change to opportunities under the MIP.

Our strategic priorities for 2018 are focused on improving profit margins, growing our business 
and developing our brand, while also remaining innovative and operating sustainably with the 
highest standards of health, safety and social responsibility. The Committee believes that EPS and 
the ratio of OCF to EBITDA remain the most appropriate criteria for measuring achievement of our 
financial objectives and that a combination of financial and non-financial criteria avoids 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.

The weighting for 2018 awards under the MIP will be: EPS: 75 per cent; and OCF to EBITDA: 25 per 
cent. Targets are set between a minimum (0 per cent) and maximum (100 per cent) range in each 
case, with on-target (budget) performance expected to deliver 70 per cent of maximum. There 
will also be non-financial performance conditions, to reflect our focus on brand, customers and 
employees. Customer service must remain at or above 95 per cent and the rate of lost time due to 
workplace accidents must not fall below an agreed threshold, benchmarked by reference to the 
“base“ year (2015). If the non-financial criteria are not met, there is a reduction of award value 
earned by 10 per cent in relation to each of these additional conditions.

Element A awards have a forfeiture threshold set annually at the time of the award. If this is 
breached, 50 per cent of the deferred balance in a participant’s Element A MIP account is forfeited.
Element B awards also have a long-term financial underpin based on a minimum EPS threshold 
that must be maintained over the 3 years from the date of grant. If this is breached, 50 per cent of 
the Element B award is forfeited. Element B awards are granted after the end of the financial 
period by reference to which they have been earned and the underpin is set at the time of grant.
The measurement period under the MIP by reference to which these targets must be met will be 
the full financial year ending 31 December 2018. It is the view of the Committee that the targets 
for 2018 MIP awards are commercially sensitive as they are primarily related to budgeted future 
profit and debt levels in the Company and therefore their disclosure in advance is not in the 
interests of the Company or shareholders. The Committee will, however, provide full retrospective 
disclosure to enable shareholders to judge the level of award against the targets set.

There are malus and clawback provisions in the MIP rules which apply to both 2017 and 2018 awards.

Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations
Competitive pay and cascade of incentives
The Committee ensures that pay is fair throughout the Company and makes decisions in relation to the structure of executive pay in the context of the cascade 
of pay structures throughout the business. The Committee’s remit includes setting remuneration for Executive Directors and overseeing remuneration levels 
and structure of rewards for senior management. Targets under the MIP and the Bonus Share Plan ("BSP") scheme use the same measurements. In addition, 
there are incentive opportunities for employees (other than Executive Directors and senior management) that are job related.

Living wage employer
Marshalls is proud to be a “Living Wage Employer”, underscoring its commitment to its employees. Marshalls benchmarked its average salaries against 
other similar companies (as part of the review of job evaluations carried out by external consultants in connection with the HR system implementation) 
and this showed that its average pay rates for equivalent jobs were generally competitive or at the higher end of the comparable range.
Saving for the future
In 2017 the Group established a new defined contribution scheme within a Master Trust operated by Aviva, and increased its overall employer 
pension contribution, benefiting the majority of employees. This will provide an improved pension savings mechanism for employees.
Bonus Share Plan
The Bonus Share Plan approved in 2015 provides the opportunity for those in the BSP to earn “free" bonus shares of up to 5 per cent of salary, which 
vest after 3 years subject to continued employment.
Sharesave Scheme / Share Purchase Plan
The Marshalls 2015 Sharesave Scheme encourages wider ownership of Marshalls plc shares across the entire workforce, which ensures that the 
employees are able to participate in the Group’s success in a way that aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The Share Purchase Plan allows 
employees to purchase shares on a monthly basis out of gross salary, another way of incentivising investment by employees in the Company’s shares.
Fairness throughout our supply chain
From living wages in the UK to the elimination of child labour in India, we are committed to ensuring that what is good for business is good for 
society. Our approach to labour rights is driven by the ETI Base Code which we adopted in 2005. To ensure that the Base Code principles are 
embedded within operations and supply chains, we employ social auditors in India, China and Vietnam, who regularly carry out checks and audits 
to ensure that the Base Code is being upheld and to report any concerns or violations so that we can take swift action should we need to. Marshalls 
has also worked closely with external organisations to evaluate our business and supply chain against the principles now embodied in the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 to eliminate slavery in all its forms. Our Modern Slavery Statement can be found on the Company’s website (www.marshalls.co.uk). 
Marshalls was the first company in its sector to belong to the ETI and is committed to the ETI Base Code.
Pay comparisons
CEO ratio
Our CEO to average employee pay ratio for 2017 is 64.1. This is measured as the ratio of CEO single figure pay realised in the year to average (mean) 
employee pay. To give context to this ratio, we have included a chart tracking CEO pay and average employee pay since Martyn Coffey’s appointment 
alongside Marshalls’ TSR performance over the same period. The Remuneration Committee has always been committed to ensure that CEO reward 
is commensurate with performance. The chart shows a clear alignment between shareholder returns and CEO single figure pay. The CEO single 
figure for 2013 was affected by the retiring CEO’s 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards vesting early on a pro-rata basis owing to his good leaver status.

56

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEThe factors leading to the increase in the ratio over the last 3 years is the strong performance of the Company reflected in the total shareholder 
return which has resulted in high levels of vesting of share-based incentives granted to the CEO. The value of these incentives has also materially 
increased over the performance period due to share price growth, as shown in the charts on pages 53 and 54. Shareholders expect the CEO to have 
a significant proportion of his pay based on performance and paid in shares. It is this element of his package which provides the volatility in CEO 
remuneration and the variations in the ratio.

This chart shows the Group’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance compared to (i) the FTSE Small Cap Index and (ii) the FTSE 250. TSR is 
defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends. Marshalls plc was a constituent of the FTSE Small Cap Index for the period from January 
2009 to August 2015 and became a constituent of the FTSE 250 in August 2015. This chart shows the value at 31 December 2017 of £100 invested 
in Marshalls plc on 1 January 2009 compared with the value of £100 invested in (i) the FTSE Small Cap Index and (ii) the FTSE 250. The other plotted 
points are the intervening financial year ends. Marshalls’ TSR performance was 232 per cent better than the overall performance of the FTSE Small 
Cap Index and 239 per cent better than the FTSE 250 in 2017.

Notes:

(a) Martyn Coffey’s salary was increased on 1 January 2017 by 2 per cent, the same percentage increase as given to the workforce as a whole.

(b) The bonus is the non-deferred amount earned for the relevant year taken from the single figure remuneration table on page 60.

(c)  A 2 per cent increase was awarded to the workforce on 1 January 2017. The table above shows, however, that the average salary increase per employee for 2017 was slightly lower. This was due to variations 

in overtime in the current year and specific variations relating to the impact and timing of leavers and new starters.

(d)   The table above shows that the average bonus per employee decreased by 34.3 per cent in 2017 compared with the prior year. This is due to the impact of the participation of senior management (other 

than Executive Directors) in the 2017 MIP. In 2017, the MIP bonus comprised the first year of cycle 2 of the Scheme, with no elements carried forward from cycle 1 resulting in a fall against the previous year. 
Amounts carried forward from earlier years for Executive Directors are disclosed in the long-term incentive column of the single figure remuneration table on page 60. In 2016, the final LTIP awards also vested.

Gender balance and pay
At the end of 2017 our total workforce comprised 2,603 employees with the following gender balance:

Total workforce 
Senior managers 
Directors 

Male

83% 
86% 
83% 

Female

17%
14% 1
17%

1 

  Senior managers comprise those in positions of management or control within the business as reflected in job bandings and measured consistently with previous years. The Company has also provided 
data to the Hampton-Alexander reporting initiative in relation to the gender balance at the levels of Board, Executive and their direct reports. This showed a slightly higher female percentage at 
Executive Committee level (19.4 per cent) based on the smaller Hampton-Alexander reporting sample.

The UK Government Equalities Office legislation requires employers with more than 250 employees to disclose information on their gender pay 
gap annually. The first such disclosure is based on amounts paid in the April 2017 payroll. The bonus gap is based on incentives paid in the year to 
31 March 2017. The Marshalls Group has two employing companies: Marshalls plc (which has less than 250 employees, mostly at Director/Senior 
Manager level) and Marshalls Group Limited, which employs all remaining employees. The charts show the consolidated results for Marshalls plc 
and Marshalls Group Limited, which provides a more accurate overview of pay balance; however, the separate information that is required by the 
legislation in relation to Marshalls Group Limited is also included below. This information will also be posted on Marshalls’ website. CPM Group Limited 
was acquired in October 2017, and will report separately for 2017 as it remains a separate employer. 

Marshalls is committed to equal pay and opportunities for men and women throughout the Group. The gender pay gap analysis is based on a calculation 
of the average hourly pay and bonus of all our employees, irrespective of what job they do. This shows that as at April 2017 there is a median gender pay 
gap of 19.3 per cent (consolidated) (20.7 per cent: Marshalls Group Limited), and a mean gender pay gap of 15.7 per cent (consolidated) (17.8 per cent: 
Marshalls Group Limited). Our recruitment policies, salary and bonus structures are designed to be gender-neutral, and for male and female employees 
in similar roles, the rates of pay and bonus are the same. However, as the gender split analysis shows, more than 80 per cent of our workforce are male, 
and there are more males than females in every pay band across the organisation. This is representative of the construction sector generally.

We are evaluating the 2017 results to develop our understanding of the detailed contributory factors. In broad terms, because the construction 
sector has traditionally attracted more men than women, a majority of our longer-serving employees (for example in middle management or shift 
leader positions) are male, and most of the senior roles, attracting the highest pay and bonus, are also currently held by men, we believe these are 
the main reasons for the difference. With the assistance of PwC, we will be analysing the results in detail so that we are able to develop our 
processes. A breakdown pay gap by quartile is shown opposite:

When analysing bonus outcomes, the same factors are relevant. We know our bonus awards are gender-neutral, and across our consolidated 
workforce more women than men participate in a bonus scheme: however, the predominance of men in senior roles carrying higher base pay 
means that we are also reporting a gender pay gap in mean and median bonus.

The introduction during 2017 of our new HR system, together with a pay benchmarking exercise across all jobs within the organisation, will, for the 
first time, allow us to develop consistent control monitoring of recruitment policies and pay. This in turn will lead to better alignment of pay with job 
grades, which are scored in a gender-neutral way. We are also engaged in initiatives to make our employment opportunities more attractive to 
female applicants to address gender imbalance, for example in outreach programmes in schools and colleges to support women in engineering, 
in reviewing and improving flexible working policies for all our workforce and in ensuring that recruitment fosters applications from individuals of 
diverse backgrounds to improve the gender mix.
Diversity initiatives 
The Group has policies that promote equality and diversity in the workforce as well as prohibiting discrimination in any form. The Group launched 
a Code of Conduct during 2017, initially focusing on its supply chain, which clearly states its commitment to these principles and requires a similar 
commitment from its business partners.

Marshalls is supportive of the initiatives reflected in the Hampton-Alexander, Parker, and McGregor-Smith reviews to improve ratios in gender and ethnic 
diversity at Board and senior management level as well as in the wider workforce. Aligning pay and recruitment policies with these principles forms 
a key element of our planning for 2018 and beyond.

The Remuneration Committee Chair’s engagement programme is expected to include a focus on initiatives to eliminate unconscious bias, if it is 
found, and to ensure our pay and performance policies are fair and transparent with measures to encourage applications from talented and motivated 
individuals regardless of gender, ethnicity, degree of physical ability or background. Retention of such people by giving fair consideration to flexible 
working policies where appropriate, and ensuring incentive schemes are fairly distributed will also be key elements of our diversity strategies. We aim 
to make progress on these objectives in moving towards the 2020 target of at least 33 per cent of our Board and senior management being female.

We welcome and give full and fair consideration to applications from individuals with recognised disabilities to ensure they have equal opportunity 
for employment and development in our business. Wherever practicable we offer training and make adjustments to ensure disabled employees are 
not disadvantaged in the workplace.

More information on our employees, gender diversity and our social and ethical policies can be found on page 33.

Notes:

(a) Benefits are car / car allowance, fuel / fuel allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and travel and accommodation expenses.

(b)  All Directors received salary supplement allowance in lieu of contributions into the Group’s pension scheme throughout the year. No Director had any entitlement under the defined benefit section of the 

pension scheme and no additional benefit was received as a result of early retirement.

(c)  The annual bonus column shows 50 per cent of the total bonus contribution earned under the MIP Element A in respect of 2017 performance, and 50 per cent of the total value of Element B shares awarded 

which are deferred but are not subject to further performance conditions (other than continued employment). The remaining 50 per cent in respect of 2017 Element A is deferred into shares in the MIP 
account which are subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a further holding period. The remaining 50 per cent of 2017 Element B shares is subject to performance and employment-
based forfeiture for a 3-year deferred period. These deferred elements will be disclosed in the long-term incentive column when the conditions are satisfied. The deferred shares in relation to both Element A 
and Element B may change in value during the holding period depending on the Marshalls’ share price.

(d)  The long-term incentive column shows the aggregate value of sums released from MIP or LTIP account balances from earlier years that are no longer subject to deferral and forfeiture risk.

(e)  For 2017, the LTIP column comprises the aggregate value of sums released from the MIP, at the end of the first cycle, in relation to Element A and Element B. Of these amounts, the Remuneration Committee 
have determined that MIP Element A will be settled in cash and MIP Element B will be settled in shares. For 2016, the LTIP comprises the 2014 Performance Share Award under the 2005 LTIP that vested and 
was settled during 2017.

Setting pay in context
The following graphs illustrate the relationship between total expenditure on remuneration and other disbursements from profit over the past 3 years.

The 4 elements represent the most significant outgoings for the Company during the financial year. In addition to staff pay and shareholder 
distributions, capital investment and taxation are shown for the following reasons:

• investment – the Company’s strategy is to increase capital investment to take advantage of market demand and in order to ensure that the 

business grows in a sustainable manner with a corresponding long-term benefit for all stakeholders; and

• tax – the Company is a UK taxpayer and feels that it is beneficial to demonstrate to all its stakeholders its total UK tax contribution. The most 

significant elements of the Company’s UK tax contribution are VAT, employer’s NI, corporation tax, fuel duty and aggregates levy. As profitability 
increases, corporation tax will also increase. In 2017 the Group was re-accredited with the Fair Tax Mark.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEOutcomes of incentive schemes in 2017 (audited)
This section explains how 2017 performance is reflected in rewards earned by the Executive Directors under the Company’s incentive schemes.
MIP
The MIP incorporates:

• Element A, an annual bonus award carrying a maximum of 150 per cent of salary, of which 50 per cent must be deferred into shares or share-

linked units; and

• Element B, an award normally in the form of a nil-cost option to acquire shares, carrying a maximum of 100 per cent of salary, conditional on 

continued employment for 3 years from grant and 50 per cent of which is also subject to a financial condition over the 3-year period. Element B 
shares must be held for a further 2 years after vesting.

Both awards depend on achievement of the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the date of award. The table below 
shows the 2017 performance conditions and the extent to which they have been satisfied.

Performance conditions were set at the beginning of 2017 and the Committee took account of both internal budgets and external factors such as the 
market consensus of investors for the full year 2017. During the year, cash flow from sales improved significantly and pre-tax profit grew by 13 per cent. 
This performance meant that the stretching EPS and OCF targets were both met in full, resulting in a combined 100 per cent achievement against 
target. The share price rose by 56 per cent during the year (31 December 2016: 292.5 pence; 31 December 2017: 454.9 pence), which means the 
underlying value of share and share-linked awards from previous years also increased.
EPS
EPS relates to our strategic objective to grow profits. The Group’s profit before tax increased by 13 per cent from £46.0 million to £52.1 million. 
Reported EPS improved by 14 per cent from 18.95 pence in 2016 to 21.52 pence in 2017. EPS and operating cash flow are both measured using 
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") based on the audited results of the Group and subject to the discretion of the Committee 
with regard to one-off items. For the 2017 remuneration outcomes the Committee applied adjustments for one-off items relating to the acquisition 
of CPM Group Limited and certain operational restructuring items. These adjustments gave rise to an EPS figure of 22.41 pence for the purpose 
of remuneration outcomes.
Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow is relevant for measurement of cash flow and overall sustainability. The Group’s operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 was at the top of the target range set by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
Additional performance conditions
Our customers are at the heart of our business model, and our measurement of customer service uses factors such as product availability, on-time 
delivery performance and administrative and delivery accuracy to assess performance. The Group’s average customer service performance, assessed 
monthly, exceeded its minimum target of 95 per cent throughout 2017. The Group also continued its excellent performance against its stated 
objective of keeping days lost to accidents to a minimum, by reference to the 2015 rate. Days lost to accidents year on year actually reduced by 
a further 35 per cent. Had either of these targets not been met, the overall level of MIP award would have reduced by 10 per cent; the achievement 
of these measures means that no reduction factor will apply.

(a)  50 per cent of the earned Element A award is released to the participant as annual bonus; the remaining 50 per cent is deferred into the participant’s MIP account and converted into shares. The previously 
deferred proportion of the 2016 Element A award was converted into shares by reference to the mid-market average value for the 30-day period ending on 31 December 2016. Dividends paid during the 
year are also added to the carried-forward plan account. The chart above shows the opening balance in shares at the start of the year and the closing balance after release of the 2017 entitlement, calculated 
by reference to the mid-market average value for the 30-day period ended 31 December 2017 and adding the value of dividends of 12.20 pence per share paid during 2017.

(b)  The earned Element A award for 2017 is added to the individual’s plan account, and 50 per cent of the resulting balance is released to the participant as an annual bonus; the remaining 50 per cent is deferred into
the participant’s MIP account and converted into shares. The deferral is repeated in each subsequent year up to the final year. In the final year, subject to any forfeiture provisions, 100 per cent of any balance 
in the MIP account is released. As 2017 was the final year of the first 4-year cycle, the full balances for years 1-4 plan accounts were released. At the same time, Year 1 awards for performance in 2017 were made.

(c)  The carried-forward balance is converted back into shares by reference to the mid-market average value for the 30-day period ended 31 December 2017 (440.06 pence).

(d)   If the actual EPS falls below the forfeiture threshold over the 3 years before vesting, 50 per cent of the balance of the award is forfeited. Once Element B shares have vested, they must normally be held for a 
further 2 years. Element B shares lapse on cessation of employment except in “good leaver“ circumstances, in which case they vest on leaving and must normally be held for 2 years from the date of leaving.

(e) As 2017 was the final year of the first 4-year cycle, the full balances for years 1- 4 plan accounts was released. At the same time, year 1 awards for performance in 2017 were made.

Single total figure of remuneration: Non‑Executive Directors (audited)
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company’s incentive arrangements. Their fees are reviewed periodically and were last 
reviewed in November 2017. The Chairman’s fees are set by the Committee and the CEO; other Non-Executive Directors’ fees are set by the Board as 
a whole. The Non-Executive Directors also received travel and accommodation expenses associated with attendance at Board meetings, and where 
this is a taxable benefit it is shown below as a grossed-up taxable amount.

Notes:

(a) The closing price on 31 December 2017 of 454.9 pence per share has been used to measure the number of shares required.

(b)  This comprises Element B awards granted in March 2015 (based on 2014 performance) that will vest 3 years from grant (i.e March 2018) (before deduction of any tax and NIC). These must be held for a 

minimum of 2 further years.

(c)  This column includes the 50 per cent of share interests awarded in 2015, 2016 and 2017 under Element B of the MIP in the form of nil-cost options or conditional shares that may be exercised after the 3-year 

vesting period but where vesting is only dependent on continuing employment throughout the 3-year period with no other performance conditions.

(d)   This column comprises share interests awarded under the MIP (Element A deferred shares and Element B deferred shares) that remain subject to a financial performance condition as well as to continued 

employment over the relevant deferral period. 50 per cent of Element A awards and 100 per cent of Element B awards shown in this column may be forfeited if the financial condition is not satisfied.

(e) Share interests under Element A and Element B of the MIP are calculated by reference to the mid-market average value for the 30-day period ended 31 December 2017 (440.06 pence).

(f )  The table above includes the interests of “persons closely associated“ as defined under the Financial Services and Markets Act (Market Abuse) Regulations 2016.

Service contracts and policy on termination payments
Each Executive Director has a service contract with the Company which is terminable by the Company on not more than 12 months’ notice and by the 
Director on 6 months’ notice. Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, are appointed under letters of appointment, usually for a term of 3 years. 
Either the Company or the Non-Executive Director may terminate the appointment before the end of the current term on 6 months’ notice. If the unexpired 
term is less than 6 months, notice does not need to be served. No compensation is payable if a Non-Executive Director is required to stand down.

All Directors are subject to annual re-election.

Copies of Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office on application to the 
Company Secretary and will also be on display at the Company’s AGM.

Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.80 pence (2016: 5.80 pence) per share which, together with the interim dividend of 3.40 pence 
(2016: 2.90 pence) per share, makes a combined dividend of 10.20 pence (2016: 8.70 pence) per share. The Board is also recommending payment of 
a supplementary dividend of 4.00 pence per share, which is discretionary and non-recurring. Payment of the final dividend and the supplementary 
dividend, if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will be made on 29 June 2018 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 8 June 2018. 
The ex-dividend date will be 7 June 2018.

The dividend paid in the year to 31 December 2017 and disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement is 12.20 pence (2016: 9.65 pence) 
per share, being the previous year’s final dividend of 5.80 pence (2016: 4.75 pence) per share, the interim dividend of 3.40 pence (2016: 2.90 pence) 
per share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 and the prior year supplementary dividend of 3.00 pence per share. The 2016 final and 
supplementary dividends were paid on 30 June 2017 and the 2017 interim dividend was paid on 6 December 2017. 
Share capital and authority to purchase shares
The Company’s share capital at 1 January 2018 was 199,378,755 Ordinary Shares of 25 pence. There has been no change between 31 December 2017 
and 14 March 2018. Details of the share capital are set out in Note 20 on page 108. 

The Ordinary Shares of the Company carry equal rights to dividends, voting and return of capital on the winding up of the Company, as set out 
in the Company’s Articles of Association. There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the Company and there are no restrictions on any 
voting rights or deadlines, other than those prescribed by law, nor is the Company aware of any arrangement between holders of its shares which 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights, nor any arrangement whereby a shareholder has waived or agreed to waive 
dividends (other than the EBT – see below).

The Marshalls plc Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) holds shares for the purposes of satisfying future awards that may vest under the Company’s 
share-based incentive schemes. The EBT may purchase shares in the Company from time to time to satisfy awards granted to Directors and 
Senior Executives subject to the achievement of performance targets under the Company’s incentive schemes. At 31 December 2017 the EBT 
held 1,770,354 Ordinary Shares in the Company (2016: 2,127,022 shares) in respect of future incentive awards under the Company’s employee 
share schemes. Details of outstanding awards are set out in Note 17 on pages 105 and 106. The EBT has waived its right to receive dividends on 
shares that it holds beneficially in respect of future awards. The Trustee of the EBT exercises any voting rights on such shares in accordance 
with the Directors’ recommendations.

UK-based employees of the Group with more than 6 months’ service may participate in the Marshalls plc Share Purchase Plan during any offer 
period. Employees purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company with their pre-tax salary. The shares are purchased in the market and then held in trust 
by Yorkshire Building Society. Employees receive dividends on these shares and may give voting instructions to the Trustee. 

At the Annual General Meeting in May 2017 shareholders gave authority to the Directors to purchase up to 29,886,875 shares, representing 
approximately 14.99 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital in the Company, in the market during the period expiring at the next Annual 
General Meeting at a price to be determined within certain limits. No Ordinary Shares in the Company were purchased during the year or between 
31 December 2017 and 14 March 2018 under this authority, which will expire at the Annual General Meeting in May 2018. The Directors will seek to 
renew the authority at that meeting.
Contracts of significance and related parties
There were no contracts of significance between any member of the Group and (a) any undertaking in which a Director has a material interest, or 
(b) a controlling shareholder (other than between members of the Group). There have been no related party transactions between any member of 
the Group and a related party since the publication of the last Annual Report.

There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Group. None of these are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEIndependent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Marshalls plc

Opinion
In our opinion:

• the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and 

of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;

• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as adopted 

by the European Union;

• the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 

Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework"; and

• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 

Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the Financial Statements of Marshalls plc (the "Parent Company’" and its subsidiaries (the "Group") which comprise:

• the Consolidated Income Statement;
• the Consolidated statement of Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company statements of changes in equity;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; and
• the related notes 1 to 42.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company Financial 
Statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework" (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 

We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Summary of our audit approach

Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

• the carrying value of inventory; and

Materiality

Scoping

Significant changes in 
our approach

•  acquisition accounting, in particular the identification and valuation of intangible assets within the CPM Group Limited 

acquisition and the determination of other fair value adjustments to the net assets within the acquired business..

Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with 
the prior year identified with 

. 

 and any key audit matters which are the same as 

The materiality that we used for the Group Financial Statements was £2.5 million which was determined on the 
basis of 5 per cent of profit before tax.

The Group audit team performed the audit of all UK components of the Group which accounted for 95 per cent of 
Group revenues, 99 per cent of Group net assets and 100 per cent of profit before tax.

Marshalls NV, the subsidiary based in Belgium, was audited by Deloitte Antwerp under the supervision of the Group 
audit team.

The Group acquired CPM Group Limited during the year and our audit scope has been extended to include the 
audit of this company and we have identified an additional significant audit risk for the current year relating to the 
acquisition accounting for this transaction, in particular the identification and valuation of intangible assets within 
the acquired business. There have been no other significant changes in our audit approach since the prior year. 
Taking account of our past experience from our audit work relating to the completeness of customer rebate 
expense, including the historical accuracy of management estimates of year-end rebate accruals and the relatively 
factual process of calculating these accruals, we concluded that this area was no longer a key audit matter for our 
2017 audit. There have been no other significant changes in our audit approach since the prior year.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEConclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement

Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ Statement in Note 1 to the Financial Statements about whether they considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements.

We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that 
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.

Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ Statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the 
Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required 
to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

•  the disclosures on pages 20 to 24 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 

or mitigated;

•  the Directors’ confirmation on page 21 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity; or

•  the Directors’ explanation on page 21 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group required by 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.

We confirm that we have 
nothing material to 
report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of 
these matters.

We confirm that we have 
nothing material to 
report, add or draw 
attention to in respect 
of these matters.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material mis-statement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Carrying value of inventory 

Key audit matter 
description

The Group is primarily involved in the manufacture and sale of landscape and natural stone products, selling to 
Public Sector, Commercial and Domestic end users. It records inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value, 
carrying a large amount of inventories in order to meet customer needs on demand. The Group offers a wide range 
of non-perishable products that are manufactured and subsequently stored in large quantities at various locations, 
and therefore carries a high level of inventories at any given point.

A risk exists that the sales prices of inventories, particularly those which are aged or in excess of specific customer 
requirements, may need to be discounted before they can be sold. The risk of discounting, combined with potential costs 
to move the inventories to a location where demand exists, may result in the inventories being sold at below cost.

The Directors are responsible for making judgements surrounding:

• the length of time required to sell inventories;

• the level of discounts necessary to sell inventories;

• whether inventories will need to be discounted below their cost price; and

• the appropriateness of standard costs and the level of provisioning applied.

The carrying value of the Group’s finished goods inventory is £77.9 million, as disclosed in Note 11, and is noted 
as an area considered by the Audit Committee in their report on page 48.

to the members of Marshalls plc

Carrying value of inventory continued 

How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter

We have:

•  reviewed business processes surrounding the recording of inventory quantities and management’s review of the 

valuation and provisioning of inventory items;

•  tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of certain key controls relating to purchasing, 

recording of inventory quantities and inventory provisioning across the Group;

•  attended inventory counts at key locations to observe the count procedure being undertaken and inspect the 

condition of inventories;

•  selected a sample of inventory items and agreed key inputs in the valuation such as materials costs, rebates, 

shipping costs, the overheads absorbed and expected sales prices to supporting documentation;

•  tested the calculation of overheads absorption into inventory compared to actual overhead costs incurred; and

•  used data analytic techniques to compare sales by product line to inventory cost to identify any inventory sold 

for less than its cost.

Key observations

The results of our testing were satisfactory. We concur with the basis of valuation of inventory and are satisfied that 
the level of inventory provisions is appropriate.

Acquisition accounting 

Key audit matter  
description

How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter

The Group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of CPM Group Limited during the year. The acquisition 
is accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 “Business Combinations“ and this requires judgement 
to be applied in the process of identification and valuation of intangible assets and the determination of other fair 
value adjustments to the net assets within the acquired business. This process is inherently complex and a risk exists 
that intangible assets may be incorrectly identified and valued.

As described in Note 22 to the Financial Statements, the provisional fair value of the net assets acquired has been 
estimated at £1.1 million and intangible assets have been identified and valued at £7.2 million.

We have:

•  evaluated the design and implementation of key controls relating to management’s process for identification 

and valuation of intangible assets and for determining other fair value adjustments;

•  reviewed the accounting entries recorded by agreeing to management’s acquisition accounting paper and 

workings and the sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”);

•  agreed cash paid in respect of consideration to bank statements and confirmed the total amount of 

consideration by reference to the SPA;

•  reviewed the SPA for any unusual clauses that may have accounting consequences and assessed the 

completeness of acquisition adjustments;

•  tested the significant fair value adjustments recorded in respect of the business acquired by reference to 

supporting third party evidence;

•  used our valuation specialists to review and challenge the process applied by management for determining the 
separable intangible assets and to assess the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies adopted and the 
discount rate applied in the valuation calculations; and

•  assessed the basis upon which management determine the useful economic life of each intangible asset, 

considering any contradictory evidence and benchmarking against external evidence.

Key observations

Based on our procedures we concur that the judgements made by management in identifying and valuing 
intangible assets within the acquired business, and for determining fair value adjustments, are reasonable.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEOur application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of mis-statement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:

Materiality

£2.5 million (2016: £2.3 million).

Group Financial Statements

Parent Company Financial Statements

£1.0 million (2016: £1.0 million).

Basis for determining 
materiality

Rationale for the 
benchmark applied

5 per cent (2016: 5 per cent) of pre-tax profit. 

In our professional judgement, profit before tax is a 
principal benchmark within the Financial Statements 
that is relevant to users of the Financial Statements.

0.5 per cent of net assets which is capped at 40 per cent 
(2016: 40 per cent) of Group materiality.

As a holding company, net assets are considered to be a 
primary benchmark.

Group materiality £2.5m

Component materiality range 
£0.75m to £2.1m

PBT £52m

96+4+I

 PBT

 Group materiality

Audit Committee reporting 
threshold £0.1m

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £100,000 (2016: £100,000) for the Group, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCEIndependent Auditor’s Report continued
to the members of Marshalls plc

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the 
risks of material mis-statement both at the Group and component level. In the current year, the scope of our work has been extended to take into 
account the acquisition of CPM Group Limited. The Group and Parent Company audits are performed at the Group’s head office in Elland, West 
Yorkshire. All subsidiaries of the Group except Marshalls NV, based in Belgium, and CPM Group Limited, based in Somerset are accounted for and 
audited in the UK at the Group’s head office. The Group audit team performed the audit of all UK components including CPM Group Limited, which 
accounted for 95 per cent (2016: 96 per cent) of Group revenue, 99 per cent (2016: 98 per cent) of Group net assets and 100 per cent (2016: 98 per 
cent) of Group profit before tax. 

Marshalls NV accounted for the remaining revenue, net assets and profit before tax of the Group and was audited by Deloitte Antwerp under the 
supervision of the Group audit team to a component materiality of £0.75 million. 

The senior statutory auditor has been involved in the planning, risk assessment and reporting procedures for all of the Group’s components 
including the Group’s Belgium subsidiary and members of the Group audit team have participated in the detailed group planning and close 
meetings for the Belgium subsidiary.
Other information

The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the Annual Report, other than the Financial Statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon.

We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.

Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially mis-stated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material mis-statements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material mis-statement in the Financial Statements or a material mis-statement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material mis-statement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.

In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of 
the other information include where we conclude that:

Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or

Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or

Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ 
Statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the Auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R 
(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of Financial Statements that are free from material mis-statement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material mis-statement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material mis-statement when it exists. Mis-statements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1 Accounting policies
Significant accounting policies
Marshalls plc (the “Company”) is a Public Company limited by shares, incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and is 
registered in England and Wales. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). 

The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 14 March 2018.

The Company’s registered address is Landscape House, Premier Way, Lowfields Business Park, Elland, HX5 9HT.

The following paragraphs summarise the significant accounting policies of the Group, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items 
which are considered material in relation to the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the EU and therefore the Group Financial 
Statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations. The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the IASB 
and International Financial Reporting Committee relevant to its operations and which are effective in respect of these Financial Statements.

Amendments to IFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that 
are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the 
disclosures or on the amounts reported in these Financial Statements.

Amendments to IAS 7 –
“Disclosure Initiative.”

The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for the first time in the current year. The amendments require an entity 
to provide disclosures that enable users of Financial Statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing 
activities, including both cash and non-cash changes. The Group’s liabilities arising from financing activities consist of 
borrowings (Note 15) and certain derivatives (Note 16). A reconciliation between the opening and closing balances of 
these items is provided in Note 16. Consistent with the transition provisions of the amendments, the Group has not 
disclosed comparative information for the prior year. Apart from the additional disclosure in Note 24, the application of 
these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Amendments to IAS 12 
“Recognition of Deferred 
Tax Assets for Unrealised 
Losses.” 

The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 12 for the first time in the current year. The amendments clarify how an entity 
should evaluate whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible temporary 
difference. The application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements as 
the Group already assesses the sufficiency of future taxable profits in a way that is consistent with these amendments.

“Annual Improvements 
to IFRSs 2014-2016 
Cycle.” 

The Group has adopted the amendments to IFRS 12 included in the “Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle” for the 
first time in the current year. The other amendments included in this package are not yet mandatorily effective and they have 
not been early adopted by the Group. IFRS 12 states that an entity need not provide summarised financial information for 
interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are classified (or included in a disposal group that is classified) as held 
for sale. The amendments clarify that this is the only concession from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12 for such interests.

New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the Group has not applied the following new or revised IFRSs that have been issued but 
are not yet effective and, in some cases, have not yet been adopted by the EU:

“Financial Instruments”;
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (and the related Clarifications)”;
“Leases”;
“Insurance Contracts”;
“Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions”;
“Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts”;
“Transfers of Investment Property”;

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective continued
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group 
in future periods, except as noted below:

IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” supersedes IAS 18, “Revenue”, and establishes a principles-based approach to revenue recognition 
and measurement based on the concept of recognising revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. An assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 
has been completed and revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is expected to be consistent with the current practice for the Group’s revenue. 

IFRS 16 “Leases” 
IFRS 16, which has not yet been endorsed by the EU, introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting 
treatments for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 “Leases” and the related interpretations 
when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group currently expects to adopt IFRS 16 for the year 
ending 31 December 2019. No decision has been made about whether to use any of the transitional options in IFRS 16.

IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Distinctions of operating 
leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting, and are replaced by a model where a right-of-use 
asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees (i.e. all on balance sheet) except for short-term leases and leases of 
low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, and continues 
to require a lessor to classify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease. Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease 
payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease 
modifications, amongst others. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected because operating lease payments under IAS 17 
are presented as operating cash flows; whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion 
which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.

The Group has established a working group to assess the impact of the new standard. Work performed includes assessing the accounting impacts 
of the change, the process of collecting the required data from across the business and the necessary changes to systems and processes. From work 
performed to date, it is expected implementation of the new standard will have a significant impact on the consolidated results of the Group. On 
adoption, lease agreements will give rise to both a right of use asset and a lease liability for future lease payables. Depreciation of the right of use 
asset will be recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss on a straight-line basis, with interest recognised on the lease liability. This will result in a 
change to the profile of the net charge taken to the Statement of Profit or Loss over the life of the lease. These charges will replace the lease costs 
currently charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss.

The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until the 
Directors complete the review.

As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £65.2 million. IAS 17 does not require the recognition 
of any right-of-use asset or liability for future payments for these leases; instead, certain information is disclosed as operating lease commitments 
in Note 25. 

IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments"
“The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The Group has elected not to restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9. The full impact 
of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements will depend on the financial instruments that the Group has during 2018 as 
well as on economic conditions and judgements made as at the year end. The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact 
of adopting IFRS 9 based on the financial instruments and hedging relationships as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9 (1 January 2018). 

Classification and measurement 
With respect to the classification and measurement of financial assets, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS 9 has been reduced 
compared to IAS 39. Under IFRS 9 the classification of financial assets is based both on the business model within which the asset is held and the 
contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are 3 principal classification categories for financial assets that are debt instruments: 
(i) amortised cost, (ii) fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) and (iii) fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). Equity investments 
in scope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in profit or loss unless an irrevocable election is made to recognise 
gains or losses in other comprehensive income. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in financial assets are not bifurcated but instead the whole 
hybrid contract is assessed for classification. 

Under IFRS 9, financial assets can be designated as at FVTPL to mitigate an accounting mismatch. 

In respect to classification and measurement of financial liabilities, changes in the fair value of a financial liability designated as at FVTPL due to 
credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income unless such presentation would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. 

Based on the Group’s preliminary assessment, the change in the classification and measurement of listed redeemable notes will not have a material 
impact on the Group Financial Statements.

1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” continued
Impairment 
The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects “expected” credit losses, as opposed to only “incurred” credit losses under IAS 39. Under the impairment 
approach in IFRS 9, it is not necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for 
expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses should be updated at each reporting date. 

The new impairment model will apply to the Group’s financial assets that are debt instruments measured at amortised costs or FVTOCI as well as 
the Group’s finance lease receivables, contract assets and issued financial guarantee contracts.

The Group expects to apply the simplified approach to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for its trade receivables, finance lease receivables and 
contracts assets as required or permitted by IFRS 9. The Group’s preliminary assessment is that the loss allowance for these assets as at 1 January 2018 
is not significantly different to that under IAS 39. 

Hedge accounting
On initial application of IFRS 9, an entity may choose, as its accounting policy, to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 
instead of the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. The Group has elected to apply the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements because they 
align more closely with the Group’s risk management policies. 

An assessment of the Group’s hedging relationships under IAS 39 has been performed and it has been determined that the relationships will qualify 
as continuing hedging relationships under IFRS 9. 

(a) Statement of compliance
The Group Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”). The Parent Company has elected to prepare its Financial Statements 
in accordance with FRS 101 and these are presented on pages 112 to 119.

(b) Basis of preparation 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 2 to 23. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also set out in the Strategic 
Report. In addition, Note 16 includes the Group’s policies and procedures for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of 
its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.

Details of the Group’s funding position are set out in Note 16 and are subject to normal covenant arrangements. The Group’s on-demand overdraft 
facility is reviewed on an annual basis and the current arrangements were renewed and signed on 1 August 2017. In the opinion of the Directors there 
are sufficient unutilised facilities held which mature after 12 months. The Group’s performance is dependent on economic and market conditions, the 
outlook for which is difficult to predict. Based on current expectations, the Group’s cash forecasts continue to meet half-year and year-end bank 
covenants and there is adequate headroom which is not dependent on facility renewals. The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair 
value: derivative financial instruments and liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments.

The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements and are 
also set out on the Company’s website (www.marshalls.co.uk).

The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand. Sterling is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates.

The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These are set out in Note 28 on page 111. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have a significant effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 28.

(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries (which are set out in detail in Note 32 on pages 116 and 117) are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Company:

• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 1 or more of the 3 elements 
of control listed above. When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over the investee 
when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:

• the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;
• potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities 

at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the 
subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from 
the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. 

(ii) Associates (equity-accounted investees)
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant 
influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity. Associates are accounted 
for using the equity method (equity-accounted investees) and are recognised initially at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified 
on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the income and 
expenses and equity movements of equity-accounted investees, after adjustment to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from 
the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest 
in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition 
of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(iv) Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling shareholders 
that are present ownership interests, entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets, are initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the 
amount of those interests at the initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive 
income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

(d) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

For the purposes of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless 
exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.

(e) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, fuel pricing and interest rate risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.

Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value and transaction costs are recognised in the Income Statement when incurred. The gain 
or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. However, where derivatives qualify for 
hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged (see accounting policy (f )).

(f) Hedging
(i) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable 
forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. When the 
forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or 
loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset. For cash flow hedges, other than 
those covered by the preceding policy statement, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income or expense. The 
ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship, but the hedged 
forecast transaction is still expected to occur, it no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. The cumulative gain or loss at that point remains 
in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and cash 
flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.

(ii) Economic hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge economically the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no 
hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

(g) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (see (iv) below) and impairment losses (see accounting 
policy (m)). The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of directly attributable 
production overheads.

Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted 
IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment.

(ii) Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Property, plant and 
equipment acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see accounting policy (m)).

(iii) Subsequent costs
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost 
is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.

(iv) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. Depreciation on quarries is based on estimated rates of extraction. This is based on a comparison between the 
volume of relevant material extracted in any given period and the volume of relevant material available for extraction. Depreciation on leased assets 
is charged over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic life. Freehold land is not depreciated. The rates are as follows:

Freehold and long leasehold buildings 
Short leasehold property 
Fixed plant and equipment 
Mobile plant and vehicles 
Quarries 

 

–
–
–
–
–

2.5 per cent to 5 per cent per annum
over the period of the lease
3.3 per cent to 25 per cent per annum
14 per cent to 30 per cent per annum
based on rates of extraction

The residual values, useful economic lives and depreciation methods are reassessed annually. Assets under construction are not depreciated until 
they are ready for use.

Site preparation costs associated with the development of new stone reserves are capitalised. These costs would include:

• costs of clearing the site (including internal and outsourced labour in relation to site workers);
• professional fees (including fees relating to obtaining planning consent);
• purchase, installation and assembly of any necessary extraction equipment; and
• costs of testing whether the extraction process is functioning properly (net of any sales of test products).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
(g) Property, plant and equipment continued
(iv) Depreciation continued
Depreciation commences when commercial extraction commences and is based on the rate of extraction.

In accordance with IAS 37, provision is made for quarry restoration where a legal or constructive obligation exists, it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will occur and the financial cost of restoration work can be reliably measured. The lives of quarries are almost always long and it 
is difficult to estimate the length with any precision. The majority of quarry restoration work is undertaken while extracting minerals from new areas 
(backfilling) and therefore work can be completed without additional cost. As a result of the particular characteristics of the Group’s quarries, the IAS 
37 criteria have not been met to date based on the assets so far acquired and, therefore, no provisions have been recognised. 

(h) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group.

For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2004, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Costs relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests either at their fair value or at their proportionate 
interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.

In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition 
and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities acquired. The classification and accounting treatment of business 
combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2017 were not adjusted in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2017.

In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under 
the Group’s previous accounting framework. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 
were not adjusted in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.

Goodwill is subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested 
annually for impairment (see accounting policy (m)). In respect of equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

In respect of acquisitions where there is a contingent consideration element, an accrual is created for the estimated amount payable if it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and this can be measured reliably.

(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.

Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process meets the recognition criteria for development expenditure as set out in 
IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”. The expenditure capitalised includes all directly attributable costs, from the date which the intangible asset meets the 
recognition criteria, necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Other 
development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is 
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see (v) overleaf ) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (m)).

(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see (v) overleaf ) and impairment losses (see 
accounting policy (m)). 

Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.

(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific 
asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

(h) Intangible assets continued
(v) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless 
such lives are indefinite. Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the 
date they are available for use. The rates applied are as follows:

Customer and supplier relationships 
Patents, trademarks and know-how 
Development costs 
Software

5 to 20 years

5 to 10 years

(i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount (discounted if material) less impairment losses (see accounting policy (m)).

(j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less the estimated costs to completion and of selling expenses. 

The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them 
to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of 
overheads based on normal operating capacity, which were incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. 

(l) Assets classified as held for sale
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying
amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and expected to be completed within 1 year from the date of classification, and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.

(m) Impairment 
(i) Impairment review
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy (j)), are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at 
each balance sheet date. 

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash 
generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A cash generating unit is the group of 
assets identified on acquisition that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

The recoverable amount of assets or cash generating units is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.

(ii) Reversals of impairments 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

(n) Share capital
(i) Share capital
Share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or if it is redeemable but only at the Company’s 
option. Dividends on share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity. Non-equity share capital is classified as a liability 
if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders or if dividend payments are not discretionary. Dividends thereon are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a financial expense.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
(n) Share capital continued
(ii) Dividends 
Dividends on non-equity shares are recognised as a liability and accounted for on an accruals basis. Equity dividends are recognised as a liability in 
the period in which they are declared (appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company).

(o) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.

(p) Pension schemes
(i) Defined benefit schemes 
The net obligation in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any
scheme assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit-rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates 
approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

If the calculation results in a surplus, the resulting asset is measured at the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the 
plan, or reductions in future contributions to the plan. The present value of these economic benefits is discounted by reference to market yields at the 
balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.

When the benefits of the scheme are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in 
the Income Statement in the period of the scheme amendment.

Actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of a plan are recognised immediately within the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.

(ii) Defined contribution schemes
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.

(q) Share-based payment transactions
The Group enters into equity settled share-based payment transactions with its employees. In particular, annual awards are made to employees under the 
Company’s Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”).

The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date 
and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. Where appropriate, the fair value of the options 
granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions 
are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and 
non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

Current tax relief is available as shares vest based on the value at the date of vesting. A deferred tax asset is recognised at grant date based on the number of 
shares expected to be issued, at the value at which they are expected to be issued, proportioned in line with the vesting period.

(r) Own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust
Transactions of the Group-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Group Financial Statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in 
the Company are debited directly to equity.

(s) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it can 
be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the liability.

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either 
commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.

(t) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at the nominal amount (discounted if material).

(u) Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement upon the despatch of goods, when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer. Revenue represents the invoiced value of sales to customers less returns, allowances, rebates 
and value added tax.

No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or the possible return of goods or continuing 
management involvement with the goods.

(v) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the lease.

(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to 
each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

(iii) Financial expenses
Net financial expenses comprise interest on obligations under the defined benefit pension scheme, the expected return on scheme assets under the 
defined benefit pension scheme, interest payable on borrowings (including finance leases) calculated using the effective interest rate method, dividends 
on non-equity shares, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging 
instruments that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement (see accounting policy (f)).

(w) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred taxation. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive or in equity, in which case it is recognised accordingly.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred taxation is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, other than in a business combination, 
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred 
taxation provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are 
expected to apply when the temporary difference reverses, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred taxation asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred taxation assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 

Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.

(x) Segment reporting
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of discrete financial information about components of the Group 
that are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
As far as Marshalls is concerned, the CODM is regarded as being the Executive Directors. The Directors have concluded that the Group’s Landscape Products 
business is a single reportable segment, which includes the UK operations of the Marshalls Landscape Products hard landscaping business, servicing both 
the UK Domestic and the Public Sector and Commercial end markets. Following its acquisition, the CPM business has been included within the Landscape 
Products operating segment. Financial information for Landscape Products is now reported to the Group’s CODM for the assessment of segment 
performance and to facilitate resource allocation.

(y) Alternative performance measures
The Group uses alternative performance measures (“APMs”) which are not defined or specified under IFRS. The Group believes that these APMs, which are 
not considered to be a substitute for IFRS measures, provide additional helpful information. APMs are consistent with how business performance is planned, 
reported and assessed internally by management and the Board and provide more meaningful comparative information. In relation to the year ended 
31 December 2017 certain APMs are required as a consequence of the acquisition of CPM on 19 October 2017 in order to ensure comparability with the 
prior year period.

Like-for-like revenue growth
Management uses like-for-like revenue growth as it provides a consistent measure of the percentage increase / decrease in revenue year on year,

2 Segmental analysis continued
Segment revenues and results continued
The Group has 2 customers who each contributed more than 10 per cent of total revenue in the current and prior year.

The Landscape Products reportable segment operates a national manufacturing plan that is structured around a series of production units 
throughout the UK, in conjunction with a single logistics and distribution operation. A national planning process supports sales to both of the 
key end markets, namely the UK Domestic and Public Sector and Commercial end markets and the operating assets produce and deliver a range 
of broadly similar products that are sold into each of these end markets. Within the Landscape Products operating segment the focus is on 
one integrated production, logistics and distribution network supporting both end markets. Following the acquisition, the CPM business has been 
included within the landscape products operating segment.

Included in “Other” are the Group’s Street Furniture, Mineral Products, Premier Mortars and International operations, which do not currently meet 
the IFRS 8 reporting requirements.

The accounting policies of the Landscape Products operating segment are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. Segment profit represents 
the profit earned without allocation of certain central administration costs that are not capable of allocation. Centrally administered overhead costs 
that relate directly to the reportable segment are included within the segment’s results.

salary supplement in lieu of pension of £86,000 (2016: £84,000).

There are no Directors to whom retirement benefits are accruing in respect of qualifying services. As set out in the Annual Remuneration Report on 
page 60, the Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension equal to their contractual entitlement of 20 per cent of basic salary.

Further details of Directors’ remuneration, share options, long-term incentive plans and Directors’ pension entitlements are disclosed in the

The net amount of deferred taxation (debited) / credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year was £21,000 debit 
(2016: £798,000 debit).

The majority of the Group’s profits are earned in the UK with the standard rate of corporation tax being 19.25 per cent for the year to 31 December 2017.

Capital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law for the expenditure the Group makes on fixed assets. The rates are determined by Parliament 
annually, and spread the tax relief due over a number of years. This contrasts with the accounting treatment for such spending, where the 
expenditure on fixed assets is treated as an investment with the cost then being spread over the anticipated useful life of the asset, and / or 
impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially.

The different accounting treatment of fixed assets for tax and accounting purposes is one reason why the taxable income of the Group is not the 
same as its accounting profit. During the year ended 31 December 2017 the depreciation charge for the year exceeded the capital allowances due 
to the Group.

Short-term timing differences arise on items such as depreciation in stock and share-based payments because the treatment of such items is 
different for tax and accounting purposes. These differences usually reverse in the years following those in which they arise, as is reflected in the 
deferred tax charge in the Financial Statements.

Adjustments to tax charges arising in earlier years arise because the tax charge to be included in a set of accounts has to be estimated before those 
financial statements are finalised. Such charges therefore include some estimates that are checked and refined before the Group’s corporation tax 
returns for the year are submitted to HM Revenue & Customs, which may reflect a different liability as a result.

Some expenses incurred may be entirely appropriate charges for inclusion in the Financial Statements but are not allowed as a deduction against 
taxable income when calculating the Group’s tax liability for the same accounting period. Examples of such disallowable expenditure include 
business entertainment costs and some legal expenses.

As can be seen from the tax reconciliation, the process of adjustment that can give rise to current year adjustments to tax charges arising in previous 
periods can also give rise to revisions in prior year deferred tax estimates. This is why the current year adjustments to the current year charge for 
capital allowances and short-term timing differences are not exactly replicated in the deferred taxation charge for the year.

The Group’s overseas operations comprise a manufacturing operation in Belgium and sales and administration offices in the USA, China and Dubai. 
The sales of these units, in total, were less than 5 per cent of the Group’s turnover in the year ended 31 December 2017. In total, the trading profits 
were not material and no tax was due.
7 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 21.52 pence (2016: 18.95 pence) per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders for 
the financial year, after adjusting for non-controlling interests, of £42,503,000 (2016: £37,350,000) by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the period of 197,518,109 (2016: 197,130,419).

All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units (“CGUs”) and 
these CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is 
monitored for management purposes. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired.

94

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS10 Intangible assets continued
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations and at both 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 the full 
amount of goodwill in the Group Balance Sheet related to the Landscape Products CGU. The goodwill arising on the acquisition of CPM is included 
within the landscape products CGU. These calculations use cash flow projections based on a combination of individual financial 5-year forecasts, 
containing assumptions for revenue growth and operational gearing, and appropriate long-term growth rates of 2.45 per cent. To prepare value-in-use 
calculations, the cash flow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-based discount rate. The pre-tax discount 
rate used to calculate the value in use was 9.8 per cent (2016: 9.5 per cent). The Directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and 
do not consider that any reasonable change in the assumptions would give rise to the need for further impairment.

Included in software additions is £910,000 (2016: £819,000) of own work capitalised.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS16 Financial instruments
The Group holds and uses financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage its interest rate, liquidity and currency risks. The Group 
primarily finances its operations using share capital, retained profits and borrowings. The Group’s bank loans are non-equity funding instruments, 
further details of which are set out on page 100.

As directed by the Board, the Group does not engage in speculative activities using derivative financial instruments. Group cash reserves are held 
centrally to take advantage of the most rewarding short-term investment opportunities. Forward foreign currency contracts are used in the 
management of currency risk.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and pricing risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks and they have remained unchanged since 2016.

Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as its total equity and net debt balances. The Group manages its capital structure in light of current 
economic conditions and its strategic objectives to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity balances.

The Group manages its medium-term bank debt to ensure continuity of funding and the policy is to arrange funding ahead of requirements 
and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed facilities. A key objective is to ensure compliance with the covenants set out in the Group’s 
bank facility agreements.

From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market; the timing of these purchases depends on market prices. Primarily the shares 
are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Group’s incentive schemes. Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by 
the Board.

There has been no change in the objectives, policies or processes with regard to capital management during the years ended 31 December 2017 
and 31 December 2016.

Financial risks
The Group has exposure to a number of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by the Group’s 
operational policies, guidelines and authorisation procedures, which are outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33. The key financial risks 
resulting from financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and pricing risk.

In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over the 
longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings. For instance, a 
weakening of Pound Sterling on the foreign currency market would increase the cost of certain raw materials, whereas a strengthening would have 
the opposite effect.

(a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Board is responsible for ensuring that the 
Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due and does so by monitoring cash flow forecasts and budgets. Cash 
resources are largely and normally generated through operations and short-term flexibility is achieved by bank facilities. Bank debt is raised centrally 
and the Group aims to maintain a balance between flexibility and continuity of funding by having a range of maturities on its borrowings. Details of 
the Group borrowing facilities are provided on page 101.

(b) Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to review regularly the terms of its available short-term borrowing facilities and to assess individually and manage each 
long-term borrowing commitment accordingly. The Group borrows principally at floating rates of interest and, where appropriate, uses interest rate 
swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile, thereby managing the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

Approximately 60 to 70 per cent of core debt is covered by interest rate swaps of varying maturities, which reflects the maturity date of the related 
loans and medium-term requirements, in accordance with Group policy. The Group classifies its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and states 
them at fair value. The fair value of interest rate swaps is a £14,000 asset (2016: £49,000 liability) and is adjusted against the hedging reserve on an 
ongoing basis. 

The period that the swaps cover is matched against the debt maturity in order to fix the impact on the Income Statement. During the year £23,000 
(2016: £nil) has been recognised in other comprehensive income for the year with £43,000 (2016: £75,000) being reclassified from equity to the 
Income Statement. The interest rate swaps have been fully effective in the period.

With the addition of the fuel hedges (Note 16(e)) and forward contracts this gives a total of £146,000 credit (2016: £1,123,000 credit) recognised in 
other comprehensive income for the year with £385,000 debit (2016: £1,681,000 credit) being reclassified from equity to the Income Statement.

Sensitivity analysis
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have decreased equity and profit by the amounts shown below. The 
sensitivity analysis has been undertaken before the effect of tax. The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk has been 
determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. 

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments 
with variable interest rates, financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate 
element of interest rate swaps. The analysis was performed on the same basis for 2016.

(c) Credit risk
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all 
customers requiring credit over a certain amount and, where appropriate, credit insurance cover is obtained. This provides excellent intelligence to 
minimise the number and value of bad debts and ultimately provides compensation if bad debts are incurred. An ageing of trade receivables is 
shown in Note 12 on page 95.

Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating equal to or better than the Group. 
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties with whom the Group has a signed netting agreement as well as 
sound credit ratings. Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying 
amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.

(d) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling. The currencies giving 
rise to this risk are primarily Euros and US Dollars.

The Group’s policy is to cover all significant foreign currency commitments in respect of trade receivables and trade payables by using forward 
foreign currency contracts. All the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than 1 year after the balance sheet date. Where necessary, the 
forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.

The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is 
£42,000 asset (2016: £30,000 asset) and is adjusted against the hedging reserve on an ongoing basis. At 31 December 2017 all outstanding forward 
exchange contracts had a maturity date within 6 months.

(e) Pricing risks
Where appropriate the Group uses hedging instruments to mitigate the risks of significant forward price rises of fuel in relation to expected 
consumption. The current hedges held are in place until 31 December 2017. The Group classifies its fuel hedges as cash flow hedges and states 
them at fair value. The fair value of the fuel hedges is £391,000 asset (2016: £676,000 asset) and is adjusted against the hedging reserve on an 
ongoing basis. The period that the fuel hedges cover is matched against future expected purchases in order to fix the impact on the Income 
Statement. During the year £123,000 (2016: £1,123,000) has been recognised in other comprehensive income, with £428,000 (2016: £1,606,000) 
being reclassified from equity to the Income Statement. The fuel hedges have been fully effective in the period.

(f) Other risks
Further information about the Group’s strategic and financial risks is contained in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33.

Effective interest rates and maturity of liabilities
At 31 December 2017 there were £259,000 (2016: £293,000) of Group borrowings on a fixed rate. Interest rate swaps have been taken out with the 
intention to fix the interest on approximately 60 to 70 per cent of the Group’s core debt. The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities was:

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table.

(a) Derivatives
Derivative contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price at the relevant rate 
and deducting the current spot rate. For interest rate swaps, broker quotes are used.

(b) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Fair value is calculated based on the expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the 
balance sheet date. 

(c) Finance lease liabilities
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements. 
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.

(d) Trade and other receivables / payables
For receivables / payables with a remaining life of less than 1 year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables / 
payables are discounted to determine the fair value.

(e) Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments, measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation techniques used to 
determine fair value.

• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 

indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

17 Employee benefits
The Company sponsors a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK (“the Scheme”). The Scheme is administered within a trust which is 
legally separate from the Company. The Trustee Board is appointed by both the Company and the Scheme’s membership and acts in the interest 
of the Scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company. The Trustee is also responsible for the investment of the 
Scheme’s assets.

The defined benefit section of the Scheme provides pension and lump sums to members on retirement and to dependants on death. The defined 
benefit section closed to future accrual of benefits on 30 June 2006 with the active members becoming entitled to a deferred pension. Members 
no longer pay contributions to the defined benefit section. Company contributions to the defined benefit section after this date are used to fund 
any deficit in the Scheme and the expenses associated with administering the Scheme, as determined by regular actuarial valuations.

The Trustee is required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the Scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must 
be best estimates.

The defined benefit section of the Scheme poses a number of risks to the Company, for example longevity risk, investment risk, interest rate risk, 
inflation risk and salary risk. The Trustee is aware of these risks and uses various techniques to control them. The Trustee has a number of internal 
control policies, including a risk register, which are in place to manage and monitor the various risks it faces. The Trustee’s investment strategy 
incorporates the use of liability-driven investments (“LDIs”) to minimise sensitivity of the actuarial funding position to movements in interest rates 
and inflation rates.

The defined benefit section of the Scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every 3 years. The next actuarial 
valuation is expected to be carried out with an effective date of 5 April 2018. These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the 
requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence. This contrasts with these accounting disclosures which are 
determined using best estimate assumptions.

A formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2015. The results of that valuation have been projected to 31 December 2017 by a qualified 
independent actuary. The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the projected unit method.

The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows:

The return-seeking assets and LDI assets have quoted prices in active markets. The valuation of the insured pensions has been taken as the value of 
the corresponding liabilities assessed using the assumptions set out above.

The Scheme has no investments in the Company or in property occupied by the Company.

The Company expects to pay no contributions to the defined benefit section of the Scheme during the year ended 31 December 2018.

Sensitivity of the liability value to changes in the principal assumptions
If the discount rate were 0.1 per cent higher (lower), the defined benefit section Scheme liabilities would decrease by approximately £6.6 million 
(increase by £6.9 million) if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.

If the inflation assumption were 0.1 per cent higher (lower), the Scheme liabilities would increase by £2.7 million (decrease by £2.7 million). In this 
calculation all assumptions related to the inflation assumption have been appropriately adjusted, that is salary, the deferred pension and pension in 
payment increases. The other assumptions remain unchanged.

If life expectancies were to increase (decrease) by 1 year, the Scheme liabilities would increase by £15.8 million (decrease by £15.6 million) if all the 
other assumptions remained unchanged.

Share-based payments
Marshalls plc 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The LTIP was replaced in 2014 by the Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) and accordingly no further share-based payment awards were made 
during the year ended 31 December 2017 under the LTIP. The remaining LTIP awards made in respect of the 2014 scheme year were subject to the 
achievement of a 3-year performance target. The awards vested on 15 March 2017. Details of the performance criteria applicable to 2014 LTIP 
awards were set out in the Remuneration Report in the 2016 Annual Report.

of the scheme and which has been included within wages and salaries in Note 3 and accruals in Note 14.

Employee Bonus Share Plan
A Bonus Share Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2015 under which a number of senior management employees were granted 
performance related bonuses with an element of this bonus being in the form of shares. The bonus performance criteria are the same as those 
applicable to the MIP awards and are in relation to the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. The bonus shares take the form of 
nil-cost options to acquire shares at the end of a 3-year vesting period from the date of grant, and vesting is conditional on continued employment 
at the end of the vesting period. Awards are made to participants following publication of the Group’s year-end results. Awards outstanding at 
31 December 2017 were over 328,267 shares (31 December 2016: 55,587). The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share-based 
payments were £169,000 (2016: £116,000).

All-employee Sharesave (“SAYE”) scheme
On 5 October 2015 options were granted over 1,000,000 shares to employees who had subscribed to the SAYE scheme. The option price is 291 
pence, a discount of 20 per cent to the market price on the date of grant. The option is exercisable by relevant employees after a period of 3 years. 
The total expense recognised for the year arising from share-based payments was £300,000 (2016: £300,000).

Employee profit sharing scheme
At 31 December 2017 the scheme held 42,328 (2016: 42,328) Ordinary Shares in the Company.

Provisions have been made for the estimated cost of settlement of certain legal and regulatory matters relating to the CPM Group Limited business 
acquired during the year, reflecting the Directors’ estimate of the likely outflow from settlement of these matters. These provisions are expected to 
be settled within the next 2 years. As explained in Note 12, the Group has a right of access to the cash paid into an escrow account at the date of 
acquisition to be used to settle these matters to the extent that a liability crystallises.

The March 2016 Budget announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 17 per cent by 2020. The reduction in the rate to 17 per cent 
(effective April 2020) was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The 
deferred taxation liability at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the rate at which the deferred tax is expected to unwind in the future 
using rates enacted at the balance sheet date.

The deferred taxation liability of £702,000 (2016: £727,000) in relation to employee benefits is in respect of the net surplus for the defined benefit 
obligations of £4,127,000 (2016: £4,276,000 net surplus) (Note 17) calculated at 17 per cent (2016: 17 per cent).

Deferred tax assets on capital losses and overseas trading losses have not been recognised due to uncertainty around the future use of the losses.

Deferred taxation liabilities represent sums that might become payable as tax in future years as a result of transactions that have occurred in the 
current year. The explanation as to why such liabilities may arise is included in the notes to the tax reconciliation (Note 6).

The deferred tax balances on short-term timing differences are expected to reverse within 1 to 3 years.

Based on the current investment programme of the Group and assuming that current rates of capital allowances on fixed asset expenditure 
continue into the future, there is little prospect of any significant part of the deferred taxation liability of the Company becoming payable over the 
next 3 years. It is not realistic to make any projection after a 3-year period.

Consolidation reserve
On 8 July 2004 Marshalls plc was introduced as the new holding company of the Group by way of a court-approved Scheme of Arrangement under 
Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985. The restructuring was accounted for as a capital reorganisation and accounting principles were applied as 
if the Company had always been the holding company of the Group. The difference between the aggregate nominal value of the new shares issued 
by the Company and the called-up share capital, capital redemption reserve and share premium account of Marshalls Group plc (the previous 
holding company) was transferred to a consolidation reserve.

Hedging reserve
This represents the gains and losses arising on derivatives used for cash flow hedging, principally from the Group’s interest rate swaps, energy price 
contracts and forward exchange contracts.

Dividends
After the balance sheet date the following dividends were proposed by the Directors. The dividends have not been provided and there were no 
income tax consequences.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS22 Acquisition of subsidiary
On 19 October 2017, Marshalls Mono Limited acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of CPM Group Limited, a precast concrete manufacturer 
which specialises in underground water management solutions. The acquisition is in line with the Group’s 2020 Strategy. CPM Group Limited 
operates within the UK and is registered in England and Wales.

The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below:

Initial cash consideration paid to the vendors was £26,272,000 and, in addition, a further £12,000,000 was paid into an escrow account in relation to 
certain ongoing legal and regulatory matters identified during the course of due diligence carried out prior to concluding the acquisition. Provisions 
of £11,840,000 have been recorded at the date of acquisition, for the estimated liabilities arising from concluding these ongoing matters (see Note 18). 
The Group has a right of reimbursement of amounts held in an escrow account to the extent that any liability crystallises in respect of these ongoing 
legal and regulatory matters to enable the Group to settle these liabilities, up to the full value of the £12,000,000 held in escrow and consequently 
a reimbursement asset of £12,000,000 has been recognised within other debtors. To the extent that any liabilities arising from these ongoing legal 
and regulatory matters are resolved at a lower amount than the escrow balances, the excess balance remaining in escrow is payable to the vendors 
as additional consideration.

Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of the receivables (shown above) approximate to the gross contractual amounts receivable. 
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial. 

The goodwill arising from the acquisition represents the opportunity to grow by utilising the capabilities and technical expertise of the acquired 
workforce and by developing synergistic opportunities. 

The goodwill arising from the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Transaction costs incurred on acquisition were £837,000, and these have been fully expensed in the period (Note 3).

CPM Group Limited contributed revenue of £9,017,000 and profit of £749,000 to the Group’s profit for the period between the date of acquisition 
and the balance sheet date.

If the acquisition of CPM Group Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue for the period would have been 
£485,532,000 and Group profit before tax would have been £56,255,000.

Transactions with key management personnel
Other than the Directors, there are no senior managers in the Group who are relevant for establishing that Marshalls plc has the appropriate 
expertise and experience for the management of its business.

Directors of the Company and their immediate relatives control 0.1804 per cent (2016: 0.0881 per cent) of the voting shares of the Company. 

In addition to their salaries and pension allowances, the Group also provides non-cash benefits to Directors. Further details in relation to Directors 
are disclosed in the Annual Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 63.
28 Accounting estimates and judgements
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies and 
estimates and the application of these policies and estimates. The accounting policies are set out in Note 1 on pages 78 to 87. As stated in the 
accounting policies, revenue is disclosed net of rebates. Whilst the Directors do not regard the determination of accruals for rebates as a key area of 
estimation uncertainty, the estimation of appropriate accruals for rebates requires commercial assessment. Note 11 contains details of the Group’s 
inventory. Whilst not considered by the Directors to be a key source of estimation uncertainty, the carrying value of the Group’s finished goods 
inventory has been reviewed using commercial judgement with regard to the assessment of the appropriate level of provisioning against inventory 
obsolescence and for net realisable value. The Directors consider the following to be the only key source of estimation uncertainty.

•  Note 17 contains information about the principal actuarial assumptions used in the determination of defined benefit pension obligations. These 

key assumptions include discount rates, the expected return on net assets, inflation rates and mortality rates and have been determined 
following advice received from an independent qualified actuary. Sensitivity analysis is disclosed in Note 17 on page 105.

The critical accounting judgements applied in the preparation of the Financial Statements are:

• Note 2 contains information about the assumptions and judgements made relating to the identification of operating segments for the Group as 

defined in IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”; and

•  Note 22 contains information relating to the acquisition of CPM Group Limited. Judgement was applied in determining the fair value adjustments.

MARSHALLS PLC 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNotes to the Company Financial Statements

29 Accounting policies
The following paragraphs summarise the main accounting policies of the Company, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are 
considered material in relation to the Company’s Financial Statements. The Company is exempt from the requirement to give its own disclosures as the 
entity forms part of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Marshalls plc, which has included disclosures under IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”.

(a) Authorisation of Financial Statements and Statement of Compliance with FRS 101
The Parent Company Financial Statements of Marshalls plc for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors 
on 14 March 2018. Marshalls plc is a public limited company that is incorporated, domiciled and has its registered office in England and Wales. The 
Company’s Ordinary Shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange and the Company is not under the control of any single shareholder.

These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (“FRS 101”).

No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

(b) Basis of preparation
The Company has adopted FRS 101 from the UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for all periods presented.

The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.

In these Financial Statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

• the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 – 52 of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments”;

• the requirement of IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”;

• the requirement of paragraphs 91 – 99 of IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”;

• the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” to present comparative information in respect of: paragraph 

79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;

• the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f ), 16, 39(c), 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 – 136 of IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”;

• the requirements of IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”;

• the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”;

• the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”;

• the requirements in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” to disclose related party transactions entered into between 2 or more members of a group, 

provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; and

• the requirements of paragraphs 134(d) – 134(f ) and 135(c) – 135(e) of IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.

The Company also intends to take advantage of these exemptions in the Financial Statements to be issued in the following year. Objections may be 
served in the Company by shareholders holding in aggregate 5 per cent or more of the total allocated shares in the Company. Where required, 
additional disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(c) Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment. The Directors consider annually whether a 
provision against the value of investments on an individual basis is required. 

(d) Share capital
(i) Share capital
Share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or if it is redeemable but only at the Company’s 
option. Dividends on share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity. Non-equity share capital is classified as a liability 
if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders or if dividend payments are not discretionary. Dividends thereon are 
recognised in the profit and loss account as a financial expense.

(ii) Dividends 
Dividends on non-equity shares are recognised as a liability and accounted for on an accruals basis. Equity dividends are recognised as a liability in 
the period in which they are declared (appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company).

(e) Pension schemes
(i) Defined benefit scheme 
The Company participates in a Group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The defined benefit section of the 
scheme was closed to future service accrual in July 2006.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company. The defined benefit cost and contributions payable are borne by Marshalls 
Group Limited and, therefore, the defined benefit surplus or deficit is recorded in Marshalls Group Limited. Full details are provided in Note 17 on 
pages 103 to 106.

(ii) Defined contribution scheme
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense as incurred.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS29 Accounting policies continued
(f) Share-based payment transactions
The Company enters into equity settled share-based payment transactions with its employees. In particular, annual awards are made to employees under the
Company’s Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) and the Employee Bonus Share Plan (“BSP”).

These schemes allow employees to acquire shares in Marshalls plc. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. Where appropriate, the fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of 
awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense 
is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

Current tax relief is available as shares vest based on the value at the date of vesting. A deferred tax asset is recognised at grant date based on the 
number of shares expected to be issued, at the value at which they are expected to be issued, proportioned in line with the vesting period.

(g) Own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust
Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Group Financial Statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases 
of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

(h) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at nominal amount (discounted if material).

(i) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred taxation. Income tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred taxation is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, other than in a business combination, 
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred 
taxation provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are 
expected to apply when the temporary difference reverses, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred taxation asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred taxation assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 

Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
30 Operating costs
The audit fee for the Company was £25,000 (2016: £20,000). This is in respect of the audit of the Financial Statements. Fees paid to the Company’s 
auditor for services other than the statutory audit of the Company are not disclosed in the Notes to the Company Financial Statements since the 
consolidated accounts of the Group are required to disclose non-audit fees on a consolidated basis.

Details of Directors’ remuneration, share options, long-term incentive plans and Directors’ pension entitlements are disclosed on pages 50 to 63 of 
the Annual Remuneration Report.

The average monthly number of employees of Marshalls plc (including Executive Directors) in the year ended 31 December 2017 was 178 (2016: 95). 
The personnel costs for the majority of these employees are borne by Marshalls Group Limited. The personnel costs charged to Marshalls plc in the 
year were £5,090,000 (2016: £4,071,000) in relation to 19 employees (2016: 17), including the Directors.

granted to employees of Marshalls Group Limited.

MARSHALLS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS40 Pension scheme
The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Marshalls plc Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”) which has both a defined benefit and a defined 
contribution section. The assets of the Scheme are held in separately managed funds which are independent of the Group’s finances. 

Full details of the Scheme are provided in Note 17. The Company is unable to identify its share of the Scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent 
and reasonable basis.

The latest funding valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2015 and was updated for the purposes 
of the 31 December 2017 Financial Statements by a qualified independent actuary.
41 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions. Although these judgements 
and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge, actual results ultimately may differ from these estimates.

The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year are disclosed below.

Note 17 contains information about the principal actuarial assumptions used in the determination of defined benefit pension obligations. These key 
assumptions include discount rates, the expected return on net assets, inflation rates and mortality rates and have been determined following 
advice received from an independent qualified actuary. Sensitivity analysis is disclosed in Note 17 on page 105.

Note 33 contains details of the Company’s deferred taxation. Liabilities recognised are determined by reference to the likelihood of settlement 
and the likelihood that assets are received is based on assumptions of future actions.
42 Related parties
Related party relationships exist with other members of the Group. All operating costs are borne by Marshalls Group Limited and are recharged to 
Marshalls plc in respect of specifically attributable costs. All related party transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s 
length transactions.
