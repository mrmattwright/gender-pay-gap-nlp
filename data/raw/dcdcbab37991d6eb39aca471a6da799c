Credit Suisse UK Entities Gender Pay Gap 
Report 2017

Introduction
We know that greater organisational diversity correlates strongly 
with better organisational performance – it provides us with a 
fuller understanding of our clients, enhanced innovation in our 
solutions and broader knowledge of regional markets. 

We are committed to delivering on our global Diversity & 
Inclusion strategy, ensuring we have a working environment 
which is free from discrimination. This commitment can be 
seen in the many programmes and networks we have in place, 
which are firmly embedded within our UK businesses and are an 
essential element of our working culture.

As a bank, we believe that the public reporting of gender 
pay gaps is an important step in understanding and tackling 
gender equality issues. To this end, our pay gap analysis has 
confirmed that the root cause of our firm’s and, it appears, 
our industry’s gender pay gap is the higher proportion of men in 
senior and higher-paying roles. 

We of course recognise our equal pay obligations. Importantly, 
the gender pay gap figures presented here do not represent 
a comparison of men and women in like-for-like roles, but 
instead they show the differential when the average pay of 
all male and female employees is calculated. Our results are 
therefore heavily impacted by the proportion of men in more 
senior level roles.

We have been focussing on gender diversity for a number 
of years, including assessing gender representation across 
our UK businesses to see if there is more we can be doing 
to increase the number of senior women in our organisation. 

This has led us to enhance our existing gender strategy to 
concentrate on key elements across our employee lifecycle. 

While we have made strong advances in ensuring an even 
gender distribution at graduate and entry-level roles, we 
recognise that we must do more. It is at the senior level where 
we are now focussing our attention. This includes an even 
greater emphasis on the advancement of women through 
the bank, as well as hiring more women into senior roles. We 
are pleased to see that these targeted interventions have led to 
year-on-year improvements.

As part of this goal, in June 2016 we were one of the first 
signatories to HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter and 
will aim for a minimum of 35% female representation on our 
management committees by 2020. This, combined with existing 
high profile initiatives such as “Real Returns” (our programme 
designed to re-engage talented senior professionals and help 
facilitate their transition back into the workforce), will be at the 
heart of our continued drive for tangible and positive change in 
gender diversity at Credit Suisse, especially at a senior level, 
making us truly reflective of the communities we live in, partner 
with and serve.

Gender distribution

In the model, you can see a simplified view of an example 
firm’s employee distribution. At each level of the organisation 
males and females are paid the same, ensuring equal pay for 
equal work.

However, the greater proportion of males in senior and higher-
paid roles increases the average male pay compared to female 
average pay, creating a gender pay gap.

Our UK Entities
Credit Suisse has three employing entities – Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, Credit Suisse International and Credit Suisse 
(UK) Limited – for which we are required to provide gender pay gap information under the reporting regulations. This information 
is shown below. As at April 5, 2017, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited (2,503 employees) mainly employed our Corporate 
Functions teams; Credit Suisse International (1,383 employees) mainly employed our Global Markets and Investment Banking & 
Capital Markets functions and Credit Suisse (UK) Limited (252 employees) employed our Private Banking businesses.

As each of these entities contains more than 250 employees, we have provided their gender pay gap results separately below.
The results shown previously were based on a consolidated view of the three Credit Suisse entities.

Explaining Mean and Median

Mean
The mean is one way of determining an average. It  
is calculated by adding several items together and dividing the 
total by the number of items.

Median
The median is another way of showing an average. It 
represents the middle number in a given sequence of 
numbers when that sequence is put in rank order.

We strongly believe in creating an environment where diversity of thought and experience contribute to the success of  
Credit Suisse and have embedded diversity at every stage of the employee lifecycle. Below are some of our key gender diversity 
activities that we have put in place with the aim of supporting our female workforce and to improve gender equality across our 
organisation.

We welcome the gender pay gap legislation which has shone a light on this important issue. Each of these activities tackles 
different obstacles that may have historically hindered the progression of women across our industry. Through this holistic 
approach, we are striving to ensure that gender equality is a fundamental part of the employee experience at Credit Suisse where 
each element will no longer be an “initiative”, but just a standard part of the way we work. We are continually looking to make 
improvements and are optimistic that the actions we are taking to embed diversity in our organisation will reduce our pay gap.
