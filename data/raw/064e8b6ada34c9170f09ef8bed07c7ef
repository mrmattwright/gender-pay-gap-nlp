As a group, Euroclear continues to monitor its gender pay gap as part of its on-going commitment to its Employee Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) and Wellbeing strategies. These strategies aim at helping create an environment where all employees feel valued, respected and fully engaged to contribute to our future success; regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, religion or disability.  Euroclear is committed to continuing to take positive steps to equalise any gender-based pay gaps identified by the annual pay review processes adopted by the company across all its locations and companies.

Our remuneration practices have been built on, and are driven by a gender-neutral approach. We deploy a series of controls ensuring that performance ratings, bonus and salary decisions are fairly and consistently applied during the annual compensation review process.  The representative data below indicates a level of parity of average salaries of men and women when assessed by each of the internal functional levels of the hierarchy at Euroclear in the UK.  Note that for level 1, the sample size (three employees) is not representative enough to draw conclusions.         Ratio: average salary women to average salary men         Ratio: average remuneration women to average remuneration men      I confirm that the data reported is accurate.
