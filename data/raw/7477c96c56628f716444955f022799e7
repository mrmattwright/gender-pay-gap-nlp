UK GENDER PAY REPORT 2017
Interserve

Interserve is one of the world’s foremost support services 
and construction companies. 

At Interserve we are committed to creating a diverse and 
inclusive workplace where all of our people feel at ease 
and can progress. We take this commitment extremely 
seriously and have a range of programmes underway and 
more initiatives planned to ensure this happens.

We welcome the UK government’s requirement for large 
companies to be more transparent on gender pay. We are 
publishing the data for 21 employing entities of which 18 
employ more than 250 people1. 

Across all of the employing entities we have reported, there is 
some diversity in the statistics and this is a feature of the 
different types of businesses that we have, the employees 
they have traditionally attracted and also length of service. 

Support Services

Support Services, which is our largest division, focuses on the management and delivery of outsourced operational activities. 
It has a relatively even split between genders with 52% male and 48% female. The median gender pay gap is 16.2%, which is 
under the UK’s national gender pay gap of 18.1%*. The division’s median bonus gender pay gap is 71.4%.

This gap exists due to the majority of senior colleagues in this division being male, which impacts our gender pay gap across 
the division. This difference is most prevalent in the defence and industrial sectors, where historically roles have typically 
been seen - within wider society - as more attractive to men. 

Our Citizen Services business, which delivers frontline public-services in the welfare, skills, healthcare and justice markets, 
has a median gender pay gap of 12.9%. Citizen Services has a 33% - 67% male – female split, with many more women 
occupying senior positions in the division compared to other parts of the Group. The division has a median bonus gender pay 
gap of 29.7%.

Construction & Equipment Services

Construction, our second largest business, has an 86% - 14% male-female split and a median gender pay gap of 29.7%, 
reflecting the fact that there are more men in senior, higher paid roles in this division. Its median bonus gender pay gap 
is 54.5%. Our engineering services arm has a gender pay gap of 29.9%.

RMD Kwikform (RMDK), our equipment services business which provides engineering solutions for the construction industry, 
has an 82% - 18% male - female split with a median gender pay gap of 9% and a median bonus gender pay gap of 34.2%.

In terms of Construction and RMDK, it is important to note that the construction and engineering sectors – in which both 
businesses operate - generally attract more men than women meaning that less women occupy senior roles as fewer women 
are recruited into these industries.

Both divisions have more male employees, and a low turnover of employees, in senior roles, which is fairly typical in the 
construction and engineering industries. Furthermore, STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) in school 
and college tend to be less favoured by females which means that there is a shorter supply of trained females looking to 
enter the construction and engineering sectors.

Interserve Group Centre

Group centre has a 65% - 35% male - female split, with a median gender pay gap of 13.9% and a median bonus gender pay 
gap of 20.7%.

Interserve runs a number of gender neutral incentive schemes. However, the make-up of our workforce and the nature of 
the sectors in which we operate impact our gender bonus pay gap in the same way as it effects our gender pay gap.

The gender pay gap at Interserve is highlighting a gender balance issue particularly in more senior roles and sectors 
traditionally dominated by males not an equal pay issue. The gap is particularly noticeable in respect of bonus as our 
incentive schemes are targeted at more senior people in the organisation. We know more needs to be done to close the 
gender pay gap within the organisation and we have several activities and initiatives underway to achieve this.

Our first female chief executive, Debbie White, joined the company last year, which we believe will inspire positive 
change throughout Interserve. This is alongside the social influences outside of the Group which are currently driving a 
positive gender shift around the perception of certain roles within the sectors in which we operate.

TAKING ACTION

We have a number of initiatives across our businesses,
including a women’s network and coaching and mentoring
programmes for women. We also now insist on diverse
recruitment shortlists and track gender balance in our
headcount data and succession planning.

While our Citizen Services division reported an encouraging 
gender pay gap result, it continues to do more, including 
promoting the benefits of flexible working and running 
internal campaigns to change perceptions about certain 
roles.

We are also working on our approach towards attracting 
women to roles that have previously been identified as 
more male-dominated. Work to change the perception 
about the suitability of certain roles, which is part of our 
wider people, diversity and inclusion strategy, is ongoing.

Both of our divisions working in the construction and 
engineering sectors (Construction and RMDK - where the 
gender pay gap is more prevalent) are now running early 
career initiatives around work experience placements, 
apprentices and graduates. These initiatives are designed 
to ensure non-gender biased processes are implemented 
across both businesses and to ensure that balanced 
recruitment shortlists become the norm for all roles.

Looking ahead, the Group will continue to audit recruitment 
and training practices across the divisions to ensure they are 
free of bias and to seek equal gender balance in general 
recruitment, apprentice and graduate applications. We will 
also seek to address gender imbalances in those training for 
management roles and to ensure that mentoring and 
coaching programmes are provided by trained coaches who 
are sensitive to gender specific matters.
