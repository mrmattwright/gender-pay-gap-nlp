Creating an inclusive workplace in which everyone can thrive plays a key part in delivering on this priority.  We are committed to ensuring that all our employees are treated fairly, with dignity and respect, and with an equality of opportunity throughout their careers with Serco. Measuring, understanding and reporting our Gender Pay Gap is a welcome and important step in this journey. We have undertaken extensive analysis of what is behind our current median gender pay gap of 12.9% so that we can identify real opportunities to reduce this. The UK’s median gender pay gap for 2016 reported by the Ofﬁce for National Statistics was 18.1%.
