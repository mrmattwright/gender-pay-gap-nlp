We are passionate about building a culture and a business where people are proud to 
work, that's why improving our gender diversity across our business is so important. 
The promising news is that in comparison to the market, as you’ll see, we fair much 
better when it comes to our gender pay gap. However this doesn’t mean we will rest 
on our laurels when it comes to bridging the gap. We can and will always look at 
where we can improve. Currently our gender split across our management population 
is not where we would like it to be. This stems a lot from our operational areas which 
tend to attract a mainly male demographic. We hope to start breaking down 
stereotypes for certain roles at Exterion Media and get women interested in all parts 
of our business. We know that by encouraging and creating a diverse workforce, we 
will not only become more commercially successful but will also become an employer 
of choice when it comes to talent attraction.

While the requirement to report our gender pay gap is part of new legislation, at 
Exterion Media we are committed to building a culture centred on fairness, equality 
and inclusion. We are passionate about fair and equal pay, regularly reviewing how our 
roles benchmark internally and externally. We feel it’s our responsibility to support 
women so that they feel that they have the right avenues, knowledge and 
opportunities to continue to grow and succeed in their careers. We have inspiring 
people that work in our business, and we are truly passionate about attracting and 
developing top talent regardless of gender or any other aspect of diversity.

What does the report tell us?

•

The biggest difference in pay between males and females at 
Exterion Media sits within the upper middle and upper 
quartile statistics 

• Within the lower middle and lower quartile the top earning 

males and females are earning the same hourly rate 

•

The upper middle quartile is impacted by our predominantly 
male demographic in our operations/Enfield workforce 
(Maintenance, shift leaders, site manager etc) 

•

•

The Gender Pay Gap data is a snapshot of pay as of 5 April 
2017 (anyone who didn’t receive full pay in that month i.e. 
maternity/adoption/paternity leave, unpaid leave is not 
included as part of the report requirements)

There are more males on the bonus scheme in comparison 
to females 

• With regard to bonus, the median figure is in favour of 

females at -78%  whereas the mean is in favour of the men 
at 6.05%. The mean and median figures differ because there 
are more men who received bonus payments and of those 
men we have more receiving smaller bonus payments due 
to the amount of roles occupied by men at a middle 
management level

Apprenticeships 

Leadership Development

We will be joining forces from 2018 with a 
number of Out-of-Home (OOH) agencies 
and media owners to focus on the 
diversity in the OOH sector. We will be 
running an internal group which will 
regularly host events but also partner 
across our industry with the aim to make 
change on a much larger scale.  

We currently offer a range of 
apprenticeships across our business, 
and they have been incredibly 
successful. This year we will be 
looking at historically male 
dominated sectors to see how we 
can encourage women who are 
interested in working in this area, 
whether its through our 
apprenticeships or our work 
experience programme.

Maternity Return Support

We know that women returning after maternity leave often find it difficult to feel 
connected to the business after their time away. We will be offering coaching and 
mentoring to all maternity leavers to support them in the lead up, during and after 
their maternity leave. We will also be investing in one to one training for maternity 
returners to help them feel equipped with any changes to the business whilst they’ve 
been away.

Last year saw the launch of our first future leaders talent programme ‘Aspire’. Our 2017 
and 2018 cohorts are made up of 77% women from across the UK and our international 
businesses. 2018 sees the roll out of our leadership development training for all of our 
managers across the business. This programme is specifically in place to support and 
develop our managers technical skills with a crucial focus on the behaviours we value at 
Exterion Media. 

Flexible Working

Unconscious Bias

Anyone in our business currently has the 
opportunity to request flexible working. 
We know that for a lot of women juggling 
work and home life can be particularly 
challenging especially if your returning 
from maternity leave. We will be working 
with our department leads to see where 
part time work or job shares can work for 
our business to enable women to return 
to work and continue to develop their 
career. 

With the introduction of LinkedIn 
learning and our management 
development programme for 2018 
we will be rolling our unconscious 
bias training for all of our line 
managers.
