REFERRAL SCHEME TERMS AND CONDITIONS           REFERRAL SCHEME TERMS AND CONDITIONS       In order to qualify for the Robins and Day Love2Shop Referral Scheme (the “ Scheme ”), the following Terms and Conditions (the “ Terms ”) will apply.  “ Robins and Day” refers to Peugeot Citroen Automobiles UK Limited trading as “Robins and Day”, a company registered in England and Wales with company number 0129806 and a registered office at Pinley House 2 Sunbeam Way, Coventry, West Midlands, CV3 1ND;  “ Love2Shop ” refers to Park Card Services Limited trading as “Love2Shop”, a company registered in England and Wales with company number 03280082 and a registered office at Valley Road, Birkenhead, Merseyside, CH41 7ED;  “ Referrer ” means the person that is submitting the details of the Referee in order for Robins and Day to contact them; and  “ Referee ” means the person that is being referred to Robins and Day by the Referrer.  1.            In order to be eligible for the Scheme, the Referrer must have been a customer of Robins and Day within the previous 3 months. Robins and Day will provide an unloaded Love2shop reward card to the Referrer and advise of these Terms at the point of sale.  2.            Where the Referrer wishes to engage in the Scheme and wishes to introduce Referees to Robins and Day, the Referrer must, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, obtain the prior consent of the person they are referring, to share their personal data, before submitting their details via the Robins and Day website.  3.            The Referrer will indemnify Robins and Day for any loss or claim arising out of the Referrer’s failure to obtain the consent of the Referee in advance of providing the Referee’s details in accordance with paragraph 2.  4.            Upon contacting the Referee by telephone, Robins and Day will identify the Referrer as the origin of the Referee’s personal data and seek confirmation from the Referee as to whether they have consented to receiving marketing communication. Where the Referee has not consented and wishes to ‘opt out’ of further marketing communications then Robins and Day shall not contact the Referee again in relation to the Scheme or otherwise.  5.            There is no limit to the number of Referees that a Referrer may provide to Robins and Day and more than one Referee can reside at the same address.  6.            Where a Referee successfully purchases a new or used car from Robins and Day within 6 months of the Referrer making the referral in accordance with paragraph 2, the Referrer will be eligible to receive a financial top-up (Reward top-up) to Love2Shop reward card originally provided. For the avoidance of doubt, any purchase made by the Referee more than 6 months after the Referrer means the referral will not be eligible for a Reward top-up. Without the reward top-up, the Love2Shop reward card has no value.  7.            The Referrer must claim the Reward to-up online by providing the registration number of the car bought by the Referee.  8.            The Reward top up will be made to the referrer’s card within 1 month of the Referrer notifying Robins and Day that they are eligible to receive it. There is no alternative prize.  9.            Where a Referee returns a car purchased from Robins and Day within 3 months of purchasing it, other than where the vehicle is returned due to fault or defect, Robins and Day reserve the right to cancel or reclaim from the Referrer any Reward top-up awarded to the Referrer as a result of the purchase.  10.          Robins and Day are not responsible if a Reward Card is lost, stolen, destroyed or used without permission.  11.          Eligibility for the Scheme and any Reward top-up offered under the Scheme is at Robins and Day’s discretion and our decision is final.  12.         The Scheme is open to employees of Robins and Day but restricted to non-management and non-sales advisor staff and the referee must not be a current customer of Robins & Day.  13.          The Scheme is effective from 15 th July 2016 and Robins and Day reserves the right to terminate the Scheme at any time.  14.          The Scheme operates in accordance with the Robins and Day Privacy Policy , and attention is drawn to clauses 3.1.4, 4.1.4, 5.7 and 5.8 specifically. The Referrer is responsible for reading and accepting the Privacy Policy .  15.          A person who is not a party to the Scheme will not have any rights under or in connection with it by virtue of the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.  16.          These Terms and any dispute or claim (including any non-contractual dispute or claims) arising out of them or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, whose courts shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction over such matters.

Price of Vehicle and Additional Costs  3.1 The price of the Vehicle will be as quoted in our showroom, or otherwise notified to you in writing in the Order Confirmation (“ Price ”).

If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you. 18.7 Please note that these Terms are governed by English law.

UK TAX STRATEGY       UK TAX STRATEGY – Peugeot Citroen Retail UK Ltd    Peugeot Citroen Retail UK Ltd, member of the PSA UK Group, is involved in the automotive industry. The business activities of the PSA UK Group generate a substantial amount and variety of taxes. In the UK, we pay Corporation Tax, Stamp Duty Land Tax, employer and other taxes. In addition, we collect and pay employee taxes and VAT. The taxes we pay and collect form a significant part of our economic contribution to the UK economy.    PSA UK Group’s tax strategy reflects the business practices and ethos, as demonstrated in the arrangements described below. This tax strategy is effective from the date of publication and will be reviewed each year in accordance with Paragraph 16(2), Schedule 19, Finance Act 2016.    Approach to risk management and governance arrangements  The team of tax specialists acting on behalf of PSA UK Group have many years’ experience in UK and international direct and indirect taxation and reports to the UK Board of Directors via the Finance Director who has responsibility for tax matters and is the Senior Accounting Officer for all businesses within the scope of the strategy. Our internal processes and controls support the tax compliance and transactional tax obligations of the business providing our Board and Senior Accounting Officer with a robust framework for calculation and payment of taxes due.  Where any process weakness is identified, new processes and controls are implemented as necessary.    The Board and Senior Accounting Officer are involved in review processes and are also engaged in approving transactional details including any tax related aspects. The tax team therefore remain accountable to the wider business, frequently exchanging updates relating to business and tax developments.  Management of tax risks is a constant process. We identify, assess and manage tax risks and account for them appropriately. We aim to reduce the level of tax risk as far as is reasonably practicable by ensuring that robust and appropriate processes are in place for all activities which could have a material impact on our tax affairs.    PSA UK Group is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations and disclosure requirements in accordance with the PSA Group Code of Ethics.  We observe both the spirit as well as the letter of the law and pay an appropriate amount of tax for our business at the right time.    Attitude to Tax planning  PSA UK Group engages in tax planning that follows the spirit of UK Tax Law and has commercial substance that supports the business and reflects commercial and economic activity, ensuring the appropriate amount of tax is levied and that enables it to manage its tax efficiently. We do not use contrived or abnormal tax structures that are intended for tax avoidance.  We adhere to relevant tax law and seek to minimize the risk of dispute arising from uncertain positions. External advice is sought when in-house Tax staff need assistance with interpretation of complex tax law.    The PSA UK Group reports transactions with other group companies on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with current OECD principles.    Attitude to tax risk  PSA UK Group’s aim is to minimise the level of risk in relation to UK taxation. We are not prepared to accept a level of risk that exposes us to reputational harm or which could adversely impact our relationship with HMRC.    Working with HMRC  We seek to build and sustain a relationship with HMRC that is constructive and based on mutual respect. We work collaboratively wherever possible with HMRC to resolve disputes and to achieve early agreement and certainty.    We also engage with the government on the development of tax laws either directly or through industry and other representative bodies as appropriate to encourage an open, constructive tax legislature framework.        19.
