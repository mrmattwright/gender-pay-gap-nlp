Economic development  Today’s economic climate is continuing to demand that businesses, such as ours, carry out investment strategies to reduce costs, optimise efficiencies and mitigate risks. These initiatives are being introduced not only to ensure our ability to honour our current customer commitments but also to ensure alignment with the long term sustainability of our business.  Social  MBDA strives to be the best employer for its 10,000 people. In addition we want to attract the caliber of employee. We emphasise an inclusive and collaborative work environment with training and development available for all employees and roles which are challenging and fulfilling.  Environment  The environment is an essential and vital pillar in today’s world where natural resources are increasingly limited. MBDA wants to be a key player in this field. We want to adopt consistent and sustainable efforts to control our energy consumption and reduce our environmental impact. We have established an ambitious environmental policy which aims to contribute proactively in preserving the environment through our operations and through our products lifecycle.
