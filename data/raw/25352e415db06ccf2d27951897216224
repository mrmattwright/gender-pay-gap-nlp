Recommendations 

To note the findings of the gender pay gap calculations 

Information, issues and options 

The Gender Pay Gap Information Regulations came into force on 6 April 
2017.   

The regulations require employers with over 250 employees to publish their 
gender pay gap information before 31 March 2018.  This will then need to be 
produced annually before 31 March each year.   
 
The first set of figures requires public sector employers to use 31 March 2017 
as a ‘snapshot’ of their organisation to determine the gender pay gap.  
 

3.4  Employers will have to report on their gender pay gaps using 6 different 

measures: 
 

 
Mean Gender Pay Gap 

The difference between the mean hourly rate of males 
and females 

Median Gender Pay Gap  The difference between the median hourly rate of males 

Mean Bonus Gap 

Median Bonus Gap 

Bonus Proportions 

Quartile Pay Bands 

and females 
The difference between the mean bonus pay paid to 
males and females 
The difference between the median bonus pay paid to 
males and females 
The proportions of males and females who were paid 
bonus pay during the relevant period 
The proportions of males and females in the lower, lower 
middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands 

 

3.5 

 

 
The calculations are based on ‘gross ordinary pay’ which includes basic pay, 
allowances (but not payments to reimburse expenses), shift premium pay,

piecework pay and pay for leave.  It does not include overtime pay, pay in lieu 
of leave, benefits in kind, redundancy pay and other payments in relation to 
termination. 
 

3.6  Bonus pay means remuneration in the form of money, vouchers, securities 

and also relates to profit sharing, productivity, performance, incentive or 
commission. 
 

3.7  Public sector employers must publish the results on their own website and 

also upload the required information onto the Government’s Gender Pay Gap 
Reporting Service. 

Risk 

 
4 
 
4.1  While there are no sanctions with failing to report the gender pay gap data, 

the main risk is the reputational damage arising from failing to upload the 
information onto the EBC website and the government website.

The results show that the mean figure for women is 9.04% lower than for 
men.  However, the median figure for both is the same.  For ‘gross ordinary 
pay’ pay elements such as essential car user, standby and childcare

payments are incorporated into the calculations which distort the figures in 
favour of males.  However, it is also true that there are more males (52.6%) in 
the top quartile of pay than females (47.4%). 
 
The hourly rate for the mean figures is £12.50 for males and £11.37 for 
females. 
 
The hourly rate for the median figures is £10.60 for both male and females.  

 

The pay quartiles demonstrate that there are more females than males in the 
upper middle quartile, the lower middle quartile and the lower quartile which is 
in line with the gender ratio of the council as EBC has more women employed 
than men.  However, the only quartile where there are more men than women 
is in the top quartile occupied by higher paid employees.
