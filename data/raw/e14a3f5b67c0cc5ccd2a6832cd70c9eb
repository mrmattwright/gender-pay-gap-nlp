Our aim at Lookers is to ensure 
fairness and transparency for all  
and reducing our gender pay gap.

The Automotive Industry has a long history of male-dominated roles. 
Lookers understands that to be at the forefront of modern retail,  
we need a workforce that properly reflects our customer profile.  
We are in the early stages of our concerted efforts to diversify our 
workforce. A huge part of that is retaining and attracting females for 
all areas of our business.
 
We are already seeing encouraging signs. The  average basic pay 
gap between females and males, at Lookers, is 8.1%. But there is 
still more that we can do.

initiatives:

Our published report highlights 
that action is clearly needed to 
rectify the average bonus pay 
gap. Our key drives to attract 
females into sales roles, along 
with assessing our current 
bonus scheme provisions for all 
roles across the business, will 
ensure that we eradicate this 
anomaly in the future.
