Equality and diversity are a part of everything we do. They are the golden thread that runs through our values. We want to deliver high quality and inclusive services for our patients, communities and workforce.  Equality  It is vital that we keep pace with the changing needs of local communities and ensure that in whatever we do, no one is treated unfairly or unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of:  age, disability, gender, gender re-assignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion and belief, sexual orientation.  This list of protected characteristics describes modern society, communities, our patients and the people we work alongside. These protected characteristics are important as they form an important part of a person’s identity and enable us to understand the different needs of patients and staff.  Diversity  Diversity is all around us, every day. Diversity is about recognising and valuing individual difference.  Our patients, service users, staff and communities are different in many ways. A lot of this is influenced by culture, personal values, life experience, traditions, customs, beliefs and identity.  For further information on equality and diversity please contact;  Eleanor Shingleton Smith, Assistant Human Resources Director Equality Lead for Employment (01276 606895)  Or by post: Equality and Diversity Leads, Foundation Trust Office, Freepost GI/2587, Frimley Park Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Portsmouth Road, Frimley, Surrey GU16 5BR  Or by email : foundation.trust@fhft.nhs.uk          The Equality Act 2010 means we are committed to:
Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Act. 

Advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not. 
	
Foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not.          Useful information      Find out more about how our performance in this area is measured.
