Gender Pay Gap Reporting
As part of the Equality Act 2010 the government introduced the requirement for companies with 250 or more 
employees to provide and publish annual gender pay gap reporting. The purpose of this reporting is to assess 
levels of equality for males and females in the workplace. 

This data is reported on the snapshot date which is 5th April 2017.

Summary
We are pleased that this demonstrates our commitment to gender equality and the diversity of our workforce. 
We are confident our robust pay structure ensures equality and consistency across both male and female 
colleagues. 

Our findings indicate that we have a higher proportion of males in management positions, with more males 
achieving performance bonus than females, however females achieving bonus earn more in comparison to males. 

We value our amazing people and the part they play in Kura’s success. We continue to be committed to the equal 
treatment of males and females in the workplace, and will consistently review our pay banding, recruitment and 
selection policy, and rigorous performance and salary review process to ensure these are non-discriminatory. 

Declaration
I confirm our data has been calculated according to the Gender Pay Gap Regulations 2017.
