We believe that your later years should be as enriching as any other, and that being cared for shouldn’t mean that your quality of living is compromised, whatever your age, whatever your condition. The design of our homes and our carefully selected staff, combined with our diligent approach to each and every resident, affords them the opportunity to flourish, make new friends, maintain contact with their local communities and live a life of possibility.                 Finding Your Care Home  When you visit an Avery care home you will see first hand the excellence of our home design, and the comfort and style of our interior spaces, but you will also be struck by something that cannot be fully designed out, something that requires a far more subtle and concerted effort, the creation of a spirit of togetherness, of companionship and friendship.  We understand that fine buildings and good design is just a precursor to creating vibrant, supportive communities for the elderly that give our residents and their families the peace of mind they deserve and which celebrates the lives of our residents through sharing, reflection, good company and above all fun.  See for yourself by visiting any of our homes, spend a while in the company of our residents, talk to staff and feel the warmth and support that fills the home.
