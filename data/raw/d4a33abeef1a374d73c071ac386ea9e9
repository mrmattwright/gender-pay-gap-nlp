The Academy is formed of the following schools: - Selling C of E Primary School - Lynsted and Norton Primary School - Milstead and Frinsted C of E Primary School - Petham Primary School - Pilgrims' Way Primary School and First Steps Nursery - Lydd Primary School - Dymchurch Primary School Within the Academy, each school has its own Head Teacher who runs the school on a day to day basis. The relationship between the Schools and the Academy is set out in the Academy Charter. On joining The Village Academy, each school keeps its own name and uniform  whilst benefitting from working openly together to share good ideas - that work! We regularly celebrate the best practice and excellent work of our talented teachers and teaching assistants, and standards within our school are good and rising and most importantly of all - our children are happy. Each school is responsible for its own website where you can find out lots more information.
