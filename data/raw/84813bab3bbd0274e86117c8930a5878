The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average hourly pay for men and women in our organisation based on the snapshot date of 31 March 2017. This is different from equal pay which deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.  The data set out in this report has been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. This includes calculating an hourly rate for all staff that were paid on the snapshot date using ordinary pay. Ordinary pay includes basic pay, car allowances, shift pay, on-call and stand-by allowances. Excluded are payments for overtime, redundancy and benefits-in-kind along with employees on reduced pay due to family or sick leave.  Read the full report below.
