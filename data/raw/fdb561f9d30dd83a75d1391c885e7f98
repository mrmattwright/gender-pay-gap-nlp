Authorities are under a legal obligation to:  • Publish the classes of information that they make routinely available • Tell the public how to access the information and what it might cost  Bon Accord Care and Bon Accord Support Services are subject to the Act because they are “publicly-owned company”, as defined in section 6 of the Act. Bon Accord Care and Bon Accord Support Services are wholly owned by Aberdeen City Council.  Bon Accord Care and Bon Accord Support Services have adopted the Model Publication Scheme 2015 produced by the Scottish Information Commissioner. This scheme has the Commissioner’s approval until 31 May 2019.  You can also contact us at the address below if you prefer a copy of the Model Publication Scheme 2015, or this Guide to Information, to be provided in a different format.  Bon Accord Care 1st Floor, Inspire Building Beach Boulevard Aberdeen AB24 5HP  The purpose of the Guide to Information is to:  • allow you to see what information is available (and what is not available) for Bon Accord Care in relation to each class • state what charges may be applied • explain how you can find the information easily • provide contact details for enquiries and to get help with accessing the information • explain how to request information we hold that has not been published  Alongside the Act, the Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004 (the EIRs) provide a separate right of access to the environmental information that we hold. This Guide to Information also contains details of the environmental information that we routinely make available.      Data Protection Act Explained The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides you with a right of access to information Bon Accord Care holds about you. This is called a ‘Subject Access Request’.  Bon Accord Care is only allowed to deal with a Subject Access Request under the Data Protection Act 1998. We cannot disclose information about a living individual under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (FOISA) or the Environmental (Information) Scotland Regulations 2004( EIRs), as releasing this information in this way would mean we would be putting your personal information into the public domain and as a result would breach the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998. Our response to a Subject Access Request is treated as private and confidential.  Charges for request for your own personal data (subject access request)  The charge is a standard fee of £10.00 plus any reproduction and postage costs (both on the same basis as for FOI requests).  You can find information on how to make a subject access request by contacting us. Compliance with DPA is enforced by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is the UK’s independent public authority set up to uphold information rights. They do this by:  • Promoting good practice • Ruling on complaints • Providing information to individuals and organisations • Taking appropriate action when the law is broken  Further information can be found at:  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents https://ico.org.uk/  Guide to Information PDF     Company Gender Pay Gap Information  All companies with over 250 employees must now publish set gender pay gap information on the Government's online reporting service and also on their own company website. The information regarding the gender pay differences within the company is as follows:  All data is derived from actual payroll information at March 2017 and for Bon Accord Care Ltd.  Mean Gender Pay Gap  Mean female hourly pay is 3.6% higher than mean male hourly pay.  Median Gender Pay Gap  Median female hourly pay is 1.2% higher than median male hourly pay.  Bonus Pay  No member of staff received a bonus payment in 2016/17. It is not company policy to pay bonuses to staff regardless of gender. As a consequence the bonus information requested by the Government online reporting service was a nil response.
