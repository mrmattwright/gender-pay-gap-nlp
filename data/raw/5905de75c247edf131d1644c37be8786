Why does Millfield have a gender pay gap? 
 
Millfield is a co-educational boarding and day school in Somerset, and is the biggest local employer.  
Millfield employs a large workforce engaged in a diverse range of teaching and non-teaching roles.  
Men and women are paid equally for doing equal jobs.  The main reasons for the gender pay gap at 
Millfield are the high proportion of female colleagues employed in lower-paid jobs, such as cleaning 
and  domestic  roles,  many  of  which  are  flexible  part-time,  term-time  only  positions;  and  a  lower 
proportion of women in senior management roles. 
 
 
 
 
 

How is Millfield addressing the gender pay gap? 
 
Millfield is committed to diversity and equal opportunities for both pupils and staff.   We are keen to 
recruit and develop more female employees into senior management roles, whilst encouraging more 
men to take up support roles. 
 
I confirm that the information in this report is accurate.
