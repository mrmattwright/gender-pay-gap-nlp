Gender Pay Gap 
Report 2017

The gender pay gap at SAGE is

Our Equality, Diversity and 
Inclusivity mission statement

SAGE  Publishing  is  committed  to  being  an  inclusive 
employer where all individuals are treated equally with 
fairness and respect, regardless of age, disability, gender 
identity, marriage and partnership status, pregnancy and 
maternity, race, religion and belief, sex, or sexual orientation.

We want to create a work environment where all engaged 
individuals feel that SAGE is their natural home: we believe 
in developing individuals to their full potential and giving all 
employees the opportunity to excel. We champion equality 
and diversity initiatives, we encourage individual expression 
of identity and we embrace a culture of inclusion. We engage 
the workforce positively in equality and diversity issues and 
require all members of the SAGE community to listen to 
different viewpoints and perspectives without prejudice. We 
aim to be the envy of our competitors – to be people with 
high standards, who care for each other, and above all who 
take pride in working at SAGE.

There are a lot of factors which influence 
the pay gap numbers, but broadly the gap 
is driven by: 

The impact of higher executive salaries.

The UK senior management group 
at SAGE is a team made up of 
50:50 women to men. However, 
the two most senior London based 
executives, who occupy leadership 
positions in SAGE’s global business, 
are both men.

The balance of men and women in the company. 

In common with 
many publishing 
companies, we 
have a large number 
of women  
in publishing roles.

Currently, of 
those earning 
within the lower 
pay quartile, 

69% 

are women. 

Of those 
earning within 
the upper pay 
quartile, only  

47% 

are women. 

Having a predominantly female workforce in the lower 
quartiles heavily influences the median and mean hourly 
rate of pay for women.

Our technology functions occupy the upper quartile 
and are male dominated.

•  We are unhappy with the size of the gap and we will 
therefore be taking positive action to reduce it. 

•  We welcome the push that this Government initiative 

gives to SAGE to examine the dynamics behind the gender 
pay gap and the causes of the gap within our company.

•  We are an organization that wants to support both 

women and men equally to flourish throughout their careers.

The bonus pay gap at SAGE is

20.7%
43.9%  

median (middle)

mean (average)

•  The bonus pay gap results are influenced by the same 

factors as the pay gap. 

•  The impact of executive salaries is magnified as the 

senior management group receive a bonus and long-term 
incentive payments based on the global results of the 
company. This forms a more significant proportion of their 
pay than that of staff below senior management level.  

•  The SAGE bonus includes a flat amount which is applied 

equally regardless of gender, part-time working or maternity.
•  The remainder of the staff bonus is weighted to pay. Those 

on maternity leave receive their bonus as if they were on 
full pay.

Proportion of women and men receiving a bonus payment

91.5%

of women were  
paid a bonus

94.4%

of men were paid 
a bonus

•   All SAGE permanent employees receive a bonus which is 

paid in March each year.

•   Staff joining in the first quarter of the year do not qualify for 

the previous year’s bonus. 

•   2.9% difference between women and men receiving 
a bonus is because the ratio of women to men hired 
January to March 2017 exceeded the ratio of women to 
men already employed.

We aim to reduce our gender pay gap significantly over time. 
There is no overnight solution to closing this gap. We are 
firstly working to understand it and to assess the actions 
that we will take. We are committed to making changes to 
foster gender equality, diversity and inclusion in the short- 
and long-term.

What is our current position on gender and diversity?

•  We recognize that gender is only one factor in defining an equitable workplace.
•  We have subscribed to the Publishers Association 10 Point Inclusivity Action Plan for inclusivity developed while SAGE’s 

Stephen Barr was President of the PA 2016/2017.

•  SAGE already meets two key targets of the action plan:

-  at least 50% of senior management and executive leadership roles should be occupied by women.

-  ensure 15% of employees are Black, Asian and ethnic minority people within the next five years.

•  We enable part time and flexible working: 12% of staff work part time, the majority of whom are women. 

What have we done so far at SAGE?

2

We have established a gender 
equality group to focus on 
driving change.

In 2017 we engaged with EDGE 
Strategy, a leading global 
consultancy to assess gender 
equality. We have gained EDGE 
Assess accreditation.

We have started work on 
recommended actions from the 
EDGE Assessment including 
a review of our Equality, 
Diversity and Inclusion 
Policies and Dignity at 
Work Policy. 
We have reviewed our pay  
levels across the company  
for Equal Pay. 

5

We have introduced training 
programmes covering 
Unconscious Bias, 
Inclusive Management 
and Dignity at Work. We 
are committed to continuous 
inclusivity and diversity 
training, so far 195 employees 
have been trained in Inclusive 
Leadership and Unconscious 
Bias workshops.

Actions for the coming years

Equal Pay

As part of our promotion of gender 
equality within SAGE, we will:

Embed the promotion of 
equality and diversity in 
the objectives of every manager 
in the business.

 Establish a pay band structure across the 
company which will be independently audited and 
communicated.

 Undergo an analysis of career progression by 
gender throughout our organization. 

Develop a programme to recruit women into 
technology positions and to foster development 
of women in technology based roles. 

Further develop our mentoring programme 
beyond the 32 staff (24 of whom are women) already 
mentored to encourage more participants regardless 
of gender to utilize this valuable opportunity to 
enhance their career progression.

Review our maternity, paternity, adoption, parental 
leave and flexible work policies to support everyone 
who has caring responsibilities. Ensure that we 
encourage parental leave and flexible 
working regardless of gender. 

7

Introduce diverse and gender neutral selection 
panels for recruitment.

The gender pay gap is not a measure of 
Equal Pay or Equal Opportunity which are 
legal requirements for any company.

•  The right for our employees to be paid the same 

when doing the same or equal work regardless of 
gender, is of critical importance to us.  

•  Every year the senior management team at SAGE 
review salary increases for fairness and 
check for bias.  

•  This year we performed a detailed review of our 
salary and bonus data on an anonymised basis to 
check for any gender bias. 

•  Work was reviewed and interrogated by an equal 

pay panel consisting of the HR Director, COO, 
Publishing Director and the Managing Director. 

•  We are therefore confident that where there are 

differences in salary levels, it is for reasons other than 
gender.  

•  We will be using the EDGE pay regression tool 
to continue to review our application of equal pay in all 
roles at SAGE.

Our work with EDGE 

In 2017 SAGE engaged EDGE, 
the world’s leading consultancy on 
assessing organizational commitment 
to gender equality, to conduct an 
analysis of our current gender equality 
policies and practices.

Guided by our long-term goal to ensure equality, 
diversity and inclusivity are fully embedded into 
SAGE’s culture, we asked EDGE to measure and 
review our approach, and benchmark us against other 
companies in the UK and globally. 

As part of the EDGE assessment, in October 2017 
all UK-based employees were invited to participate 
in an anonymous online survey to assess individuals’ 
perception and experience of gender equality at SAGE.

SAGE employees surveyed

Some key highlights from the EDGE 
assessment include: 

•  SAGE UK employees consider that gender equality 
is important for the company to remain competitive 
in the market, with 85% of women surveyed 
and 80% of men surveyed agreeing or strongly 
agreeing to the statement.

•  The majority of survey respondents consider that 
women and men are given the same opportunities 
to be hired by the company: 81% of female 
respondents and 89% of male respondents.

•  87% of women and 84% of men believe 
that they are given the flexibility they need to balance 
their work and personal life.

•  87% of the female respondents and 86% 
of the male respondents would recommend or 
strongly recommend working in the company to a 
female friend or colleague.

•  83% of the female and male respondents 
would recommend or strongly recommend working 
in the company to a male friend or colleague.

•  EDGE commented that a number of employees 

noted that SAGE truly values gender 
equality and is taking responsibility to address any 
imbalances and are impressed with the initiatives we 
have put in place.

•  EDGE highlighted that SAGE has a better gender 

balance in top management positions, when 
compared to companies operating in the UK and 
against media companies worldwide.

The survey highlighted 
that both male and female 
employees showed 
uncertainty about being 
given fair opportunities for 
promotion with

45% 

of women  

42% 

of men

giving a positive response 
to this question.  

55% 

of women  

45% 

of men

were unclear about the 
criteria for promotion 
from their current role to 
the next higher position.  
It is apparent that we 
need to do much more 
about implementing 
and communicating 
transparent criteria for 
promotion.

Following the review EDGE have awarded SAGE 
Assess certification, showing the organization is 
making a public commitment and have recommended 
strategies to further enhance gender equality in the 
workplace. SAGE’s Gender Equality Group are currently 
reviewing these recommendations to identify both  
short- and medium-term actions to complement our  
long-term strategic goal of gender equality.
