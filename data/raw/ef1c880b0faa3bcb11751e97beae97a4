Gender Pay Gap Information
Published April 2018
 

 

1. Introduction

Scottish Opera is voluntarily choosing to carry out Gender Pay Reporting in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  

Gender Pay Reporting requires private and voluntary sector organisations with at least 250 employees on 5 April 
each year to publish pay details.  In Scotland, there is also a requirement for public bodies with 20 employees or 
more to publish their gender pay gap figures by 31 March each year as part of The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) 
(Scotland) Regulations 2012.

The data required is as follows:

a) Mean gender pay gap - the difference between the average hourly rate of pay of males and that of females, 
expressed as a percentage of men’s pay

b) Median gender pay gap – the difference between the typical hourly rate of pay of males and that of females, 
expressed as a percentage of men’s pay

c) The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band.  To calculate these figures all hourly rates of pay 
from the lowest to the highest are listed, the rates divided into four equal groups, and the number of males and 
females in each of the quarters are proportioned.

d) There are three other calculations required by the Regulations:  the mean bonus gap, the median bonus gap and 
bonus proportions.  No employees receive a bonus within Scottish Opera so these figures are 0%.

2. The Gender Pay Gap at Scottish Opera

The gender pay data, extracted from our payroll records on 5 April 2017, consisted of 174 employees: 75 males and 
99 females.  57% of employees are women, and currently women make up 55% of the membership of the senior 
management team.  There is horizontal segregation where there are clusters of men or women in different types 
of work, and there is occupational segregation that contributes to the gender pay gap.  There is a high proportion 
of women in some departments: the costume department, administration and in lower paid support roles.  Men 
predominantly fill the posts in the stage and lighting departments and the traditional craft jobs in the workshop.  
The Gender Pay Gap is 7.2%.  The gender pay gap each year will be dynamic and influenced by the level of seasonal 
recruitment that is determined by the complexity of Company activity.

a)   Women’s hourly rate is:

b)   Women’s hourly rate is:

8.7%    (mean)

Lower than Men’s

7.2%     (median)
Lower than Men’s

The average pay gap between men and women in the UK in 2016 was 18.1%.  The overall gap in Scotland was 15.6% 
(median).  The difference in the figures between Scotland and the rest of the UK is due to lower earnings overall in 
Scotland.

The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay, which relates to what men and women earn for the same or 
similar jobs or work of equal value.  The Company is confident that the gender pay gap does not stem from paying 
men and women differently.  Within Scottish Opera, men and women receive the same pay for similar work.
