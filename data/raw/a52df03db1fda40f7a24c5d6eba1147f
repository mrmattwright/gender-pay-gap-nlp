ABOUT THE REPORT
New legislation introduced in April 
2017 requires UK employers with 
more than 250 employees to publicly 
disclose their gender pay gap. The 
information in this report relates 
only to Mylan colleagues who were 
employed by Generics [UK] Ltd. as of 
5 April 2017.

The gender pay gap is a measure 
of the difference in average pay 
between men and women across all 
levels of seniority in an organisation. 
It is not the same as equal pay, 
which is used to describe what 
women and men are paid for the 
same or similar roles.

At Mylan, pay and bonus potential increase with a role’s responsibilities and scope. 
Three factors contribute to the pay gap at the time of this report: Mylan employs 
several senior male global executives in the UK whose data is included in these 
statistics; there is a higher proportion of women in administrative and support 
functions; and we employ many women early in their careers – roles that typically 
fall in the lower half of our pay quartiles.
