It identifies the difference between the average (mean and median) earnings of male and female employees, comparing hourly rates of pay and any bonuses staff may receive.  The aim of the report is to identify any imbalance in pay between genders and encourages organisations to consider positive steps to address any identified gaps.  This report details the difference in the average earnings between males and females employed by County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service (CDDFRS), provides a rationale for any differences in earnings (where applicable) and the strategies we intend to deploy to address any differences we may have.  It is important to note that gender pay gap reporting is different to equal pay auditing. An equal pay audit involves comparing the pay of males and females doing equal work within an organisation.  CDDFRS are committed to the promotion of equality, diversity and inclusion and ensuring equal opportunities to all our employees.
