median point.

elements of our pay that are considered to be bonuses for the purpose of the calculation. These include the 
Christmas Bonus (£50) which is paid to all employees each year; the attendance bonus (£100) which is paid 
to those earning less than £25,000 and have not had any sickness absence days; our long service awards; 
retirement awards and values awards.

All employees with the exception of bank workers, receive a bonus; such as a Christmas bonus.  
All workers, including bank workers are shown in the above graphic. 
Bank workers do not receive any bonus payment, and as we have more female than male bank workers,  
this results in the difference in proportions of people who received the bonus, as illustrated above.

What are We doinG aBout the Pay GaP?
we are confidenT ThaT people who do work of equal value are 
paid fairly. The pay gap arises from There being more men in 
senior posiTions in The organisaTion. in 2018 we will Take The 
following acTion wiTh The aim of reducing our gender pay gap.
JoB Families
In 2018, we will create ‘Job Families’ for roles where there are multiple people in the same or similar role 
such as catering assistants, housekeeping assistants and porters. We will make sure that there are clearer 
generic job descriptions and appropriate grading. 
Family Friendly – returninG to Work
We know that some employees feel we could do more to support them when they start a family and return  
to work after having a baby. We have reviewed our Family Friendly Policy (often referred to as our Maternity 
and Paternity Policy) and as a result we have made the following changes:
•  We have created a more structured return to work programme for men and women who have taken time 
out to look after children. 
•  We will now automatically agree to a flexible working request for a phased return to work for up to four 
weeks for anyone who is returning to work after a period of maternity, adoption or shared parental leave.
learninG and develoPment
We need to ensure women have the right skills to gain senior roles at The London Clinic. We will work 
towards ensuring that participation in our leadership programmes such as the Steps to Leadership Programme 
represent the diversity of the organisation in 2018. Whilst all participants on these programmes will be  
decided by merit we will encourage applications from all, no matter whether they are male or female. 
ContraCtors
We will reduce the number of contractors we use at The London Clinic.  
 
The london clinic is commiTTed To reducing  
our gender pay gap and being TransparenT in  
The way we reward people. i confirm The daTa 
reporTed is accuraTe.
