FINDINGS	
	
What	are	the	underlying	causes	of	the	gender	pay	gap	at	Travel	2:		
	
Under	UK	law,	men	and	women	must	receive	equal	pay	for:		

the	same	or	broadly	similar	work;		

• 
•  work	rated	as	equivalent	under	a	job	evaluation	scheme;	or		
•  work	of	equal	value.		

	
We	 are	 committed	 to	 the	 principle	 of	 equal	 opportunities	 and	 equal	 treatment	 for	 all	 employees,	
regardless	 of	 sex,	 race,	 religion	 or	 belief,	 age,	 marriage	 or	 civil	 partnership,	 pregnancy/maternity,	
sexual	 orientation,	 gender	 reassignment	 or	 disability.	 We	 have	 a	 clear	 policy	 of	 paying	 employees	
equally	for	the	same	or	equivalent	work,	regardless	of	their	sex	(or	any	other	characteristic	set	out	
above).		
	
As	such,	we:		

carry	out	pay	and	benefits	audits	as	required;	and		

• 
•  evaluate	job	roles	and	pay	grades	as	necessary	to	ensure	a	fair	structure.		

	
We	are	therefore	confident	that	our	gender	pay	gap	does	not	stem	from	paying	men	and	women	
differently	for	the	same	or	equivalent	work,	rather	the	gender	pay	gap	is	the	result	of	the	roles	in	
which	men	and	women	work	within	the	organisation.		
	
Across	our	sector,	men	are	more	likely	to	be	in	IT-related	and	senior	roles,	which	attract	higher	rates	
of	pay.	Women	are	also	more	likely	to	work	flexibly	and	many	of	the	jobs	that	are	available	across	
the	UK	recognise	the	attraction	this	has	to	candidates	and	in	retaining	existing	staff.		
	
This	pattern	from	the	UK	economy	is	reflected	in	the	make-up	of	our	workforce,	where	most	senior	
management	roles	are	held	by	men.	We	have	a	good	representation	of	women	across	the	brands	
which	 can	 be	 seen	 above	 in	 the	 table	 depicting	 pay	 quartiles	 by	 gender.	 This	 shows	 that	 our	
workforce	divided	into	four	groups	based	on	hourly	pay	rates,	with:	
		

•  Band	A	including	the	lowest-paid	percentage	of	employees	(the	lower	quartile)	and		
•  Band	D	covering	the	highest-paid	percentage	of	employees	(the	upper	quartile).		

	

For	there	to	be	no	gender	pay	gap,	there	would	need	to	be	an	equal	ratio	of	men	to	women	in	each	
Band.		
	
COMPARISONS		
	
How	does	our	gender	pay	gap	compare	with	that	of	other	organisations?	
	
The	 mean	 gender	 pay	 gap	 for	 the	 whole	 economy	 (according	 to	 the	 2016	 Office	 for	 National	
Statistics	 (ONS)	 Annual	 Survey	 of	 Hours	 and	 Earnings	 (ASHE)	 figures)	 is	 17%,	 while	 in	 the	 Travel	
agency,	tour	operator	and	other	reservation	service	and	related	activities	industry	it	is	24%.

WHAT	ARE	WE	DOING	MOVING	FORWARD?	
	
At	Travel	2	we	recognise	that	having	a	balanced	and	diverse	workforce	is	something	we	are	proud	to	
have	but	this	can	be	a	complex	journey	and	is	not	one	single	process	or	project.	
	
We	 will	 continue	 to	 regularly	 undertake	 reviews	 of	 pay,	 bonus	 and	 commission	 policies	 as	 well	 as	
undertaking	 training	 for	 managers	 on	 recruitment	 and	 ensure	 that	 our	 advertising	 and	 attraction	
methods	are	not	biased	towards	any	gender.	
	
We	are	committed	to	doing	everything	that	we	can	to	reduce	the	gap.	However,	we	also	recognise	
that	our	scope	to	act	is	limited	with	individual’s	career	and	life	choices.	
	
A	new	Head	of	People	and	Culture	role	at	Group	level	has	been	created	and	will	help	ensure	that	
People	and	Culture	remain	at	the	forefront	of	employees,	managers	and	Directors	agenda.		
	
We	recognise	that	it	may	take	several	years	before	we	see	an	impact	on	the	gap	within	our	business	
but	we	are	committed	to	working	towards	this	both	in	our	business	and	the	wider	industry.	
	
I,	Lisa	McCauley,	Managing	Director,	confirm	that	the	information	in	this	statement	is	accurate.
