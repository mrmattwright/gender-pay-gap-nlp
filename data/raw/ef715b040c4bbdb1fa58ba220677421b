As a Firm we are committed to:  Preserving the values that permeate our culture: teamwork, trust, respect, care, candour and integrity  Ensuring that everyone in the Firm feels a sense of belonging  Valuing the importance of the excellence of our people, and in doing so, ensuring we respect and appreciate the different generational and cultural needs of individuals.  Clients  We are dedicated to providing high quality legal services for all sections of the community, and to be responsive to the specific needs required by our diverse range of clients.  People  Michelmores is committed to creating an inclusive working environment, where everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential, whilst being themselves at work. We actively promote a policy and practice of equality and opportunity at all stages of employment.  We believe the source of excellence lies in the differences between us as individuals. We encourage our people to play to their individual strengths within a collaborative working environment, which is how we build strong and diverse teams.  Michelmores Gender Pay Gap report 2017  In line with 2017 government legislation, organisations with 250 employees or more must report on their gender pay gap. As a Best Companies employer, we welcome the introduction of gender pay reporting as an important tool to improve transparency on pay. Based on our analysis we believe that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent roles at Michelmores. However, our aim is to continue to improve gender pay parity and our objective is to have at least 30% of women in partner roles by 2020. For the full report please click here.  Diversity and Inclusivity Group  The Firm's Diversity and Inclusivity group is chaired by Partner Carol McCormack. The group was established to discuss and address Diversity and Inclusivity challenges we face within the legal industry and as a Firm. The group are currently focussing on three key areas: gender inclusivity, widening access to the law and unconscious bias.  Memberships  We work with a number of organisations, including Aspiring Solicitors, Pathways to Law and PRIME, to promote and encourage diversity within the Firm and the profession. We are also signatories of the Law Society's Diversity & Inclusion Charter.  Diversity Data  We regularly collect diversity data to allow us to monitor progress on our diversity and inclusion initiatives. View our 2017 Diversity Survey results here .
