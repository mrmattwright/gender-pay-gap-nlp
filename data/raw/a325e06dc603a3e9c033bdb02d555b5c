Our aim is to ensure our people have the tools, coaching and training to give their best performance.

Many of our employees are undertaking or have completed long term NVQ or other qualification based programmes of learning to further improve their personal skills and knowledge.  Gender Pay Gap Report Businesses that have over 250 employees are now required to publish an annual Gender Pay Gap Report. The Gender Pay Gap is expressed as a snapshot of pay in April 2017, and the Bonus Gender Pay Gap reflects bonuses paid between 6 April 2016 and 5 April 2017. The data does not seek to measure legally required pay equality between men and women in the same roles. At Brett we recognise that more needs to be done to address the imbalance of genders in roles across the Group and therefore in order to encourage greater gender diversity we will continue to create and improve positive, inclusive working environments where all employees can develop.
