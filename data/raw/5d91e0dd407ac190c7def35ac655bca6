Micronclean Gender Pay Reporting 2018 

23rd March 2018 

Overview 

The first Gender Pay report for Micronclean Ltd 
shows Women receive less than men by 7% on 
the  median  and  15.4%  on  the  mean.  This 
difference  is  less  than  that  reported  for  similar 
businesses. 

The company recognises the benefit of diversity 
in  the  workplace  and  has  seen  an  increasing 
number  of  Women  in  senior  roles  over  recent 
years. 

The  calculations,  using 
the  methodology 
required  under  the  Gender  Pay  Gap  reporting 
regulations,  include  187  women  and  197  Men, 
showing  the  relatively  balanced  profile  of  our 
workforce. 

The  profile  of  employees  by  quartile  has  the 
number of Women exceeding Men only in the 
lower  middle  quartile.  The  company  believes 
that  this  profile  and  the  continuing  training 
programmes we have will allow Women to gain 
a  higher  proportion  of  senior  roles  in  the 
business.

In  recent  years,  Micronclean  has  had  a  policy  of 
increasing  all  wages  by  at 
least  the  hourly 
equivalent of the increase in the National Living 
wage. This policy has helped narrow the gender 
pay gap due to the preponderance of Women in 
the 2 middle quartiles. In addition, the use of pre-
approved  Salary  Ranges  as  part  of  our 
recruitment  process  reduce  any  bias  based 
on gender 

Micronclean are pleased to report that 100% of our staff benefit from a Profit Related Pay 
scheme. This scheme has been operating for many years and is continuing for 2018.  

Micronclean  also  operate  other  bonus  schemes  for  Directors,  Managers,  Sales  staff  and 
others,  the  average  bonuses  figures  are  a  measure  of  the  Gender  profile  of  our  Senior 
Management Team. 

The Company expect to see the Gender Pay gap narrow in future years.
