The aim is for our workforce to be truly representative of all sections of society and our customers, and for each employee to feel respected and able to give their best.          Gender Pay Gap Report 2017  Chair's Statement  Our customers come from a wide range of backgrounds, and in order for us to understand them, our workforce needs to reflect them. Ensuring we are inclusive and having a diverse workforce is vital to our success.  We believe that employees who are respected and valued as part of a team in a positive working environment are encouraged to operate at their best, leading to stronger teams, higher productivity and a better service for our clients.  All UK organisations with over 250 employees are now required to share details of their Gender Pay and Bonus Gaps; the percentage of men and women receiving bonus; and the proportions of men and women in each pay quartile of the workforce.  Most organisations in the UK have a gender pay gap. We are confident that our gender pay gap is not due to paying men and women differently for equal work, but because of the concentration of men or women in particular roles and the salaries that these roles attract. Like many organisations in the construction industry, traditional ‘trade’ roles such as Plumbers and Electricians are most commonly held by male employees (89% of our workforce) and salaries for these more technical roles tend to be higher.  The percentage of women in construction continues to rise and we see the engagement of women within the industry as being pivotal to our success. Whilst acknowledging that the basis for our gender pay gap is societal, we are committed to making improvements at an organisational level, with particular focus on creating an environment in which all employees are supported to meet their potential.    Stephen Bilclough Group Chairman  What is a Gender Pay Gap?  It’s the difference between the average earnings of men and women, regardless of their role or seniority.  The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Regulations) 2017 state that from 2017, any organisation that has 250 or more employees must publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap.  The regulations require employers to report annually and within 12 months, therefore the data detailed below is based on pay data as at April 2017.  Most organisations in the UK have a gender pay gap. John N Dunn Group Ltd is confident that its gender pay gap is not due to paying men and women differently for equal work. Our gender pay gap is as the result of the concentration of men or women in particular roles and the salaries that these roles attract.  What Does Our Data Show?  Gender Pay Gap     Mean Pay Gap  20.84%    Median Pay Gap  26.69%     Gender Bonus Gap     Mean Bonus Gap  79.20%    Median Bonus Gap  73.16%         Male  Female    Proportion of different genders receiving bonus payment  69.17%  3.23%     Pay Quartiles      Male  Female    Proportion of different genders in upper quartile  92.75%  7.25%    Proportion of different genders in upper middle quartile  98.59%  1.41%    Proportion of different genders in lower middle quartile  95.71%  4.29%    Proportion of different genders in lower quartile  70%  30%     What Does the Data Mean?  We are confident that our gender pay gap is not due to paying men and women differently for equal work, but reflective of the higher salaries for our technical or trades roles which are currently held predominantly by men.  As a result, those promoted to senior management level have tended to be men as they have the requisite technical foundation required. Although our senior management team is comprised predominantly by males, we do have two female Directors who are part of the upper pay quartile and within the last five years we have promoted five women to management roles, so we are already making significant progress in the engagement of women in our business.  The data regarding bonus benefits from further explanation. Our ‘trade’ workforce are eligible to receive a monthly production bonus as part of their contractual earnings, which is based upon the amount of work they produce (piecework). This is a common type of incentive pay throughout the industry. Bonus arrangements for other staff whose work cannot be assessed quantitatively are determined by the performance of the company and individual. The fact that the “trade” workforce is currently predominantly male results in a higher proportion of male employees being eligible for bonus payments. This is because of the difference in industry norms for particular roles, rather than any difference based on gender.  Are Our Pay Systems Compliant?  In determining pay and reward for our employees we are governed for the majority of our employees by National Agreements.  For those employees not covered under such agreements we balance a number of factors, including the economic climate and company performance as well as external market to determine the terms for the roles that we offer.  Our reward systems are fully compliant with the equal pay requirements of the Equality Act 2010.  What Action are we Taking?  We recognise the need to increase female representation in the organisation, in particular in technical and senior roles and to achieve a better gender balance in the future. We are realistic in recognising that those changes require not just improvements at an organisational level, but also societal changes. We are committed, however, to continuing to take action to eliminate the causes of the gender pay gap wherever possible.  As an organisation we will focus on:   Creating a workplace environment in which women want to stay, progress and develop their career  Supporting all employees to reach their potential  Inspiring more females to work in the sector through our engagement with local schools and colleges  Ensuring that our remuneration structures are fair and equitable  Continuing to have family friendly policies, including flexible working arrangements available to all employees  Ensuring that reward, recognition, promotion and career development is based on individual contribution   For and on behalf of John N Dunn Group Ltd  Lindsay Buckingham Group HR Director                      CONTACT US
