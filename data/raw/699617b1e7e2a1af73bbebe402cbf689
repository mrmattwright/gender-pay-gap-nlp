This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation. It does not involve publishing individual employee data.  For this report Sharps have analysed pay information for those employed with Sharps on 5 th April 2017. We are required within one calendar year from April 5 th 2017, to publish on our own website and the Government’s gender pay website.  Sharps Bedrooms approach to pay is simple and straightforward and aims to ensure that we reward our employees fairly for the job they do, regardless of gender. This is supported by our policies and processes and we have diverse teams across the many arms of our business which include retail, sales, manufacturing, installations, customer services and administrative functions.  Findings for 2017      1      Average gender pay gap as a mean average          20.7%      2      Average gender pay gap as a median average          14.87%      3      Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average          54.8%      4      Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average          28.9%      5      Proportion of employees receiving a bonus payment      Male  16.3%    Female  11.2%      6      Proportion of men and women in the four quartile pay bands      Male    Female            Upper Quartile      74%    26%            Upper Middle Quartile      48%    52%            Lower Middle Quartile      33.5%    66.5%            Lower Quartile      49.5%    50.5%      Sharps Bedrooms is an equal opportunities employer and all employees are encouraged to grow and earn to their full potential.  There are pay bandings in place in the various arms of this diverse business operation and all employees working in the same bandings will be earning the same rewards. Employees in our showrooms network are rewarded beyond their pay banding system by commissions based on individual performance.  The gender split across Sharps is 51% male and 49% female and this is generally reflected across the four quartiles where the upper middle and lower quartiles have a broadly 50% split. We believe the upper quartile is more male biased because many of our middle and senior field-based installations managers and technical specialists are male, which we believe is a historical gender ratio for the construction workforce nationally.  Sharps recruits all new employees under the same structure across the business and their earnings ability depends upon their success and career progress.  We strive to continually improve our gender pay gap and will publish the results again in April 2019 as required.
