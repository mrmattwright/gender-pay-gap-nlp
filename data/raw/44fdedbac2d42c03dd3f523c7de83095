Tower	Hamlets	GP	Care	Group	is	a	federation	of	the	37	General	Practices	in	Tower	Hamlets	
providing	care	to	over	312,000	people.			
	
We	are	a	partner	in	Tower	Hamlets	Together,	an	accountable	care	partnership	of	public	and	
voluntary	sector	health	and	social	care	organisations	in	the	Borough	that	promotes	wellbeing	and	
self-help,	and	coordinates	health	and	social	care	for	our	community.	
	
We	were	formed	as	a	Community	Interest	Company	in	September	2014	and	employ	over	300	staff	
working	across	a	range	of	occupational	groups.		
	
What	we	do	
	
We	provide	a	range	of	community	and	primary	care	services	to	the	public,	various	'at	scale	services'	
for	GP	practices	and	staff	training	through	our	CEPN	and	Open	Doors	services.		
	
Health	Visiting	services	across	the	Borough	plus	Advocacy	&	Interpreting	and	GP	Out	of	Hours	form	
the	bulk	of	the	direct	service	provision	that	we	deliver,	the	overwhelming	majority	of	professionally	
qualified	staff	in	this	service	are	female.

Narrative	
	
We	recognise	our	obligations	under	the	Gender	Pay	Gap	Reporting	regulations	and	welcome	the	
opportunity	to	consider	our	workforce	from	this	important	and	valuable	perspective.	
	
Tower	Hamlets	GP	Care	Group	is	a	community	based	healthcare	provider	and	a	high	proportion	of	
our	staff	are	women,	just	over	90%	of	those	covered	by	the	pay	data	in	this	report.	This	is	not	
untypical	in	our	sector	though	it	is	perhaps	unusual	that	men	are	more	concentrated	in	the	lower	
pay	quartiles.	
	
The	majority	of	our	staff	transferred	to	the	Care	Group	from	NHS	employment	on	National	Agenda	
for	Change	terms	and	conditions.	Where	we	have	appointed	staff	directly	this	has	tended	to	be	into	
more	junior	support	roles	on	local	pay	rates	and	this	is	where	the	pay	differences	are	generally	
concentrated.	
	
We	will	be	reviewing	our	recruitment	procedures	and	practices	to	ensure	that	they	are	not	
discriminatory	and	make	necessary	changes.
