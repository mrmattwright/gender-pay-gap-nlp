Christian Dior is committed to equal opportunities and the promotion of diversity and equality in the workplace. We have a strong policy on the management of equal opportunities. Diversity and transparency to others are fundamental values for us, ensuring fairness for all our employees in terms of careers and development, by guaranteeing equal opportunities for all genders based on objective criteria. We are convinced that diversity and equality, in all its forms, is a source of wealth and creativity for our teams.  The reports show the ‘Median’ and ‘Mean’ pay gap for the total population.  As with most businesses we employee less people at Senior Executive positions and within the UK we have one Senior Executive whose responsibilities are not compariable to the rest of the positions within our network, hence due to this the salary of this position is not a true reflection of the gender pay gap and we have produced fiqures including and excluding this position.  Our population of female employees are twice the number of male employees and this is also reflected within the results of our ‘Median’ and ‘Mean’ calculations.  The LVMH gender objective at senior management is to be 50:50 by 2020 and our aim will be to focus on vertical and horizontal integration to achieve this level.  Our results show the ‘Median’ & ‘Mean’ pay gap as at the snapshot date of the 5th April 2017. The mean pay gap is 13.57%, due to the reason referred to previously is not representative of our employees.  Excluding the person’s pay the company’s gender mean pay gap is reversed to -2.9% and the median pay gap is -8.3%.   UK Population : Male 34% ; Female 66% Median : -8.3% Mean : 13.57%     UK population (Excludes Senior Exec) : Male 34% ; Female 66% Median : -8.3% Mean : -2,9%   The mean and median gender pay gap by pay quartile shows the split between each quartile is equal and supports the company objective of an even integration of positions within hierachy and pay scale.   Lower Quartile : Male 53%; Female 47% Median : -3,10% Mean : 0,50%   Lower Middle Quartile: Male 29% ; Female 71% Median : 1,23% Mean : 0,35%    Upper Middle Quartile : Male 16% ; Female 84% Median : 0,20% Mean : 0,06%   Upper Quartile : Male 41% ; Female 59% Median : -4,70% Mean : 28,10%   Upper Quartile (Excludes Senior Exec) Median : -4,70% Mean : -4,90%  Bonus is a contractual benefit for management and head office positions. Head office accounts for 6.3% of our population and 18% of the employees who receive a contractual bonus.  The senior executive position, as explained previously is shown included and excluded to show a more reflective percentage of gender bonus pay gap being a mean of 0.07% and Median of 8.73%  We have a higher population of females receiving bonus due to our gender demographic and as stated previously our aim is to have a gender split of 50:50 by 2020 within all hierachy levels of Management.   Bonus : Male 35%; Female 65% Median : 22,33% Mean : 59,10%   Bonus (Excludes Senior Exec): Male 35%; Female 65% Median : 8,73% Mean : 0,07%  As UK Human Resources Director of Christian Dior UK Limited, I, Samantha Brunton can confirm that the data and information presented in this report are accurate and meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulation 2017.

In the same way, although photographs and other reproductions of the items for sale represent them faithfully on the Website and in the Christian Dior Couture boutiques, within the limits of the available techniques and in accordance with best market standards, they may nevertheless contain non-substantial errors. The customer acknowledges this and accepts it.

Orders received in German, English, Spanish, French and Italian will be accepted within the limit of the available stocks. To that end, the customer will be informed at the time of accepting the order, either by the Customer Relations Department, or on the Website information page describing each of the items:  -             of the availability of the item;  -             or, in the event of temporary unavailability of the item in question, of the possibility of ordering it with a view to subsequent delivery within the timeframe specified on this occasion.  If, despite the Company's vigilance, the items ordered are no longer available, the Company will inform the customer of this by any appropriate means (telephone call or email) as soon as possible.   4.2 The customer undertakes to ensure that all the information communicated to the Company via the Customer Relations Department or on the Website in the context of his/her order is compliant with these standard terms and conditions of sale and full, accurate and up-to-date. Failing this, the Company reserves the right: (i) to cancel the order and the corresponding payment or, (ii) in order to first check the existence and accuracy of the customer’s information and addresses, to require that he/she supplies official documents evidencing them.  It is hereby pointed out that when an order is placed, the Company collects the following personal data: the identity, user ID and password chosen by the customer on the Website, email address, telephone number, the address of the customer's usual place of residence, the delivery address, means of payment, etc. This data is necessary in order to process the order, and may be communicated solely to the Company's contractual partners intervening in the context of performance of the order (e.g. those acting as intermediaries, such as banking institutions for the payment for orders).  In particular, the customer is informed that this same personal data is also collected by FIA-NET S.A., the company responsible for analysing orders and combating credit card fraud. If a payment is not honoured owing to fraudulent use of a credit card, the personal data relating to this unpaid order will be recorded in a file concerning "payment incidents" kept and consulted by FIA-NET S.A. In this same context, the customer's communication of incorrect information, as likewise any anomalies noted in his/her order, may also be specifically processed by FIA-NET S.A.  In accordance with the Data Processing Act of 6 January 1978, the customer has the right to access his/her personal data and have it modified, rectified or deleted if appropriate.  In order to exercise this right, he/she may send a letter to: contactdior@dior.com or Christian Dior Couture – Service Relation Clientèle – 11 bis rue François 1er - BP39 - 75008 Paris.  With respect to processing carried out by FIA-NET S.A., the customer may exercise this same right by writing a letter to and proving his/her identity to: FIA-NET S.A. - Service Informatique et Libertés - Traitements n°773061 and n°1080905 - 22 rue Drouot, 75009 PARIS.   4.3 In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 121-11 of the Consumer Code, the Company is entitled, where retail sales are concerned, to refuse to accept any abnormal order that exceeds the authorized number of items, namely:    - 5 items per order and/or  - 2 identical items (regardless of their colours and/or sizes) ordered during a 30-day period of time.  The Company will also be entitled to refuse to accept any order: (i) placed by a customer with whom there is an outstanding dispute relating to the payment of a previous order; or (ii) that is not compliant with these standard terms and conditions of sale.  If the Company notes that the order does not meet these standard terms and conditions of sale (for example: an inaccurate delivery address, or an order that exceeds the order thresholds), it will inform the customer either directly on the Website, or by telephone, or by means of an email. If the customer fails to contact the Company in order to correct any inaccurate items of information or information given in his/her order that is contrary to these standard terms and conditions of sale, the Company reserves the right to purely and simply cancel the order and the corresponding payment.   Article 5 – Orders placed by telephone with the Customer Relations Department  Telephone orders can be placed with the Customer Relations Department, whose number is 33 (0) 1 40 73 73 73 (price of a local call), from Monday to Saturday from 10.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. (apart from public holidays).  Once the customer's bank has authorized the debiting of the customer's bank account, the order will be directly forwarded to the Company department responsible for preparing orders for despatch.  All orders placed in this context are binding on the customer.   Article 6 – Orders placed by Internet on the Website  Orders placed on the Website are subject to strict compliance with the procedures described below, which are confirmed by a succession of different screens on which the successive steps that the customer must imperatively follow in order to validate his/her order are duly displayed.   6.1         Step one: the customer selects the items he/she wishes to buy  On the Website, the customer selects, registers and validates the identification and quantity of the items that he/she wishes to order (whose availability will be confirmed, if this is the case, by the Company); these items will be added to his/her "Shopping Basket".   6.2         Step two: verification of the items selected  The customer may freely modify online his/her "Shopping Basket" containing the items selected, remove an item initially selected, modify the quantities ordered or alternatively add an item by clicking on the corresponding elements placed at his/her disposal in the "Shopping Basket". The price of the items selected will be automatically displayed in the "Shopping Basket", as defined below in Article 8.   6.3         Step three: confirmation of the items selected and validation of the order  Once the customer has made his/her selection and wishes to validate the contents of his/her "Shopping Basket", he/she must next identify himself/herself:  -             If he/she has an account on the Website: by his/her email address (user ID) and password;  -             If he/she does not have an account on the Website: by his/her name, address of usual residence to which the order will be invoiced to him/her, telephone number.  The customer must also validate:  -             the delivery address for the order, it being noted that the said address may correspond to the usual place of residence in Germany, Spain, France, Italia or the United Kingdom of a third party beneficiary chosen by the customer or, failing this, the address of the company in which the third party beneficiary pursues his/her professional activity if this is located in the same territory; -             the despatch method opted for (express or standard post), standard carriage costs being borne by the Company; -             and, lastly, the chosen payment method.  Once all this information has been duly recorded and validated, the price of the items, as defined below in Article 8, and the carriage costs, if any, will be automatically displayed.  After communicating the number of his/her credit card, in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 below, the customer must then click on the "VALIDATE MY PAYMENT" button in order to debit his/her bank account.  The authorization to debit his/her bank account issued by the customer's bank will then be displayed. The customer is advised to register and/or make a print-out of this debit authorization. Once the customer's bank has authorized the debiting of his/her bank account, his/her "Shopping Basket" will be directly forwarded to the Company department responsible for preparing orders; the customer will then see his/her order number displayed.  This order will be binding on the customer as from the time when the "Shopping Basket", duly filled and validated by the display of the registration page for the order, is received by the Company.   6.4         Step four: the Company's acknowledgement of receipt of the order  The Company will then acknowledge having received the order by means of an email sent to the email address communicated by the customer. In accordance with the provisions of Article 1126 of the Civil Code, the customer formally agrees to the Company's using an email for the purpose of confirming the content of his/her order.  This confirmation email will note all the information communicated by the customer and will indicate, where relevant, any difficulties or reservations concerning the order (availability of the items ordered, delivery timeframes or payment method chosen). It will give the order number allocated to the customer by the Company.   6.5         Step five: despatch of the items  At the time of despatch of the items ordered to the delivery address chosen by the customer, the Company will send the latter an email informing him/her of the said despatch and the banking of him/her payment, as provided for below in Article 9.   Article 7 – Proof of the order  Generally speaking, it is expressly agreed between the Company and the customer that emails exchanged by the parties will hold good and be held to be authentic, as will the automatic registration systems used by the Customer Relations Department or used on the Website, especially as concerns the nature and date of the order. In addition, the Company will keep the items of information concerning any order whose value is equal to or greater than one hundred and twenty euros (€120) for a period of ten (10) years. This information will be made available to the customer on his/her sending a request to that effect to: contactdior@dior.com or to Christian Dior Couture – Service Relation Clientèle – 11bis rue François 1er - BP39 - 75008 Paris. The customer is nevertheless advised, in the case of orders placed on the Website, to also keep a copy (in the form of a computer record and/or a paper print-out) of the various items of information relating to his/her order (for example, the email sent by the Company as provided for in Article 6.4 above).   Article 8 – Price of the items  The prices communicated by the Customer Relations Department or displayed on the Website are given Euros and Pounds Sterling and include all taxes applicable, such as VAT, but do not include delivery costs.  The prices involved are those in force at the date of the order.  The amount of the transport costs, if any: (i) will be communicated to the customer by telephone by the Customer Relations Department; (ii) will be automatically displayed, if relevant, on the Website at the time of the validation of the despatch method chosen by the customer, as stipulated in Article 6.3 above, and will also be communicated to the customer at the time of confirming his/her order by email.  At the time of delivery, the customer will receive written confirmation of the price paid for each item and the delivery costs charged.   Article 9 –Payment terms  The customer's purchases will be paid for by credit card. The following credit cards are accepted by the Company: "CB" cards, Visa cards, Eurocards, Mastercards, American Express cards. Cards issued by banks domiciled outside France must obligatorily be international credit cards. In this context, the customer undertakes to effect payment via a credit card of which he/she is to be the holder, which mentions his/her identity (surname and first name).  The customer will inform the Customer Relations Department by telephone of his/her credit card number and/or his/her bank details. For online payment on the Website: the customer will access a secure server operating in SSL mode (128 bits) that has been certified by a Certification Authority. The customer must provide his/her credit card number and/or his/her bank details by filling in the online payment form.  The transaction will then be effected by the customer in accordance with secure banking standards, either by telephone or on the Website, by communicating his/her credit card number and/or bank details; the customer unconditionally agrees in advance that the Company may complete the secure transaction in question. The customer therefore authorizes his/her bank in advance to debit his/her account with a view to any registrations or statements forwarded by the Company, even in the absence of invoices signed by the holder of the card. The authorization to debit the customer's account is always given only for the amount of the item/ items bought.

The customer must then return the items delivered:  -             either by following the various different steps of the procedure suggested by the Company, as described on the Website, in the context of which all the costs of returning the items will be met by the Company, within the limit of one despatch of returned items per order;  -             or by any means chosen by them, at his/her own expense. Customer is advised to keep any proof of having returned items, which presupposes that the items will be returned by the customer by recorded delivery or any other means that allows a specific date to be established.

Reimbursement of the price invoiced for items returned will be effected by crediting the customer's bank account within, at the latest fourteen (14) days as from the time when the Company receives the said items. Any personalised, revised or altered item, or any item returned in a damaged, used, incomplete or soiled condition, may not be refunded or exchanged.   Article 14 – Conformity – warranty  The customer must ascertain that the items delivered to them correspond to his/her order. If the items delivered are not the items that were ordered, the customer is advised to:  -             inform the Company of this as soon as possible, either directly on the Website under the heading "Request concerning a return", or by means of a telephone call made to the Customer Relations Department (at the number and during the times indicated in Article 3 above), or by means of an email sent to: contactdior@dior.com explaining why the item is not in conformity with his/her order,  -             and return the items in question in their original packaging (or at least in packaging that will afford the items in question an equivalent degree of protection during their return transport), in perfect condition that enables them to be put back on sale by the Company, unused, and accompanied by all the accessories and documents provided with them (notice, warranty, certificate of authenticity, etc.) and a copy of the delivery slip enclosed with the items delivered,  -             following, in order to facilitate the Company's processing of the returned item, the various different steps of the procedure suggested by the Company, as described on the Website, in the context of which all the costs of returning the item will be met by the Company, within the limit of one despatch of returned items per order.  If the customer organizes the return of the said items himself/herself, by means chosen by him/her and at his/her own expense, he/she is advised to keep any proof of having returned the items by recorded delivery, or by any other means that allows a specific date to be established. The cost of returning the item will be met by the Company, provided that the Company agrees that the customer is right in claiming that the item returned is not in conformity with his/her order, further to the latter's having sent proofs of the said costs to the Company. They will then be reimbursed by crediting the customer's bank account accordingly.  If it is not possible to exchange the item returned, and if the customer does not wish to be sent a credit note, reimbursement of the price invoiced for non-compliant items that have been returned will be effected by crediting the customer's bank account within, at the latest, fourteen (14) days as from the Company's receipt of the returned items.  Notwithstanding any specific warranty terms and conditions that may have been forwarded to the customer with the item delivered, the Company's items are subject to the following legal guarantees concerning conformity and any defects in any item sold:  Article L. 217-4 of the Consumer Code stipulates that: " The seller delivers goods that are in conformity with the sale contract, and will be responsible for setting right any non-conformity existing at the time of delivery.    It will also be responsible for any non-conformity resulting from the packaging, or from the instructions concerning assembly or installation if the seller is responsible for this under the terms of the sale contract or if it took place under their responsibility ."  Article L. 217-5 of the Consumer Code: " The good is in conformity with the contract:  1. if suitable for the use normally expected of similar goods and:  - if it corresponds to the description given by the seller and possesses the qualities presented by the latter to the purchaser in the form of a sample or model;  - if it presents the qualities that a purchaser may legitimately expect in the light of the public declarations made by the seller, the producer or their representative as, for example, in advertising material or labelling;  2. Or if it presents the characteristics defined by mutual agreement by the parties or is suited to any special use sought by the purchaser, brought to the seller's knowledge and agreed to by the latter. "  Article L. 217-12 of the Consumer Code: " Legal actions resulting from the non-conformity of goods are time-barred at the end of two years as from the delivery of the goods ."  Article L. 217-16 of the Consumer Code: " Where the buyer asks the seller, during the course of the commercial warranty granted to him/her at the time of the acquisition or repair of a product, for a repair covered by the warranty, a period of at least seven days is added to the remaining warranty period.  This period shall run from the buyer’s request to the seller or when the product in question is made available for repair, if such availability is subsequent to the request for intervention. "  Article 1641 of the Civil Code: " The seller is bound by a warranty relating to any hidden defects in the thing sold that render it unsuitable for its intended use, or which so reduce this use that the purchaser would not have bought it or would have paid a lower price for it had it been aware of these defects ".  Article 1648, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code: " Any legal action on the score of hidden defects must be brought by the purchaser within a period of two years as from the time of discovering the defect in question ".   Article 15 – Force majeure  The Company's performance of all or part of its obligations will be suspended in the event of the occurrence of an act of God or a case of force majeure, as defined in article 1218 of the Civil Code, which prevents or delays their performance. The Company will inform the customer of any such act of God or case of force majeure within seven (7) days of its occurrence.  If this suspension of the Company's performance of its obligations continues for more than fifteen (15) days, the customer will have the possibility of cancelling the order in course. In this case, the customer will be reimbursed by the Company as soon as possible by crediting his/her bank account.   Article 16 – Non-renunciation  The fact that at any given time the Company abstains from enforcing the performance of any of the provisions set forth in these standard terms and conditions of sale cannot be interpreted as constituting renunciation of the possibility of subsequently invoking the said total or partial non-performance.   Article 17 – Validity of the standard terms and conditions of sale  Should any of the provisions of these standard terms and conditions of sale come to be declared wholly or partially null and void, the other provisions and all the other rights and obligations resulting from the said standard terms and conditions of sale will remain unchanged and will continue to be applicable.   Article 18 – Disputes - Applicable law  THESE STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE ARE GOVERNED BY FRENCH LAW, EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF ANY IMPERATIVE PROVISIONS TO THE CONTRARY PURSUANT TO EC REGULATION no. 593/2008 OF 17 JUNE 2008 CONCERNING THE LAW APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (ROME I).
