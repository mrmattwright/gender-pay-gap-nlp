Under new legislation that came into force in April, UK employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish their gender pay gap.  Our analysis shows that the overall difference between men and women’s earnings at PDSA is 28.5% (mean) or 44.3% (median) based on hourly rates of pay at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.  Our employee population is made up of 85% females and 15% males and our research suggests that our gender pay gap is driven by fewer men in the lower pay quartiles. We are proud that our female employees are well represented across all the pay quartiles:               The number of females receiving a bonus was 2 (total female population = 1559)        The number of males receiving a bonus was 3  (total male population = 270)         Only a small number of employees received a bonus, however the average bonus paid to female employees was greater than the average bonus paid to males, giving us a bonus pay gender gap of - 6.5% (mean) and - 22.4% (median). Please note that none of the Executive Team within PDSA received bonus payments.   Pay Quartiles       Pay quartile   Pay Range (per hour)     Females     Males     Pay Gap        Lower  £5.28 - £9.25  88%  12%  -2.26%    Lower Middle  £9.26 - £11.29  93%  7%  -1.19%    Upper middle  £11.30 - £16.29  92%  8%  7.36%    Upper  £16.30 - £80.21  68%  32%  -0.24%              We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our organisation as we have a clear and robust job evaluation system that focuses on the job not the job holder.  We are addressing our gender pay gap by:   Reviewing our recruitment methods and training, to ensure no unconscious bias is being applied to roles within the lower quartiles.  Focusing on areas in the organisation where the gender pay gap is highest.  Understanding our gender pay gap in the wider context of the sectors from which we recruit..   We are encouraged to see that our mean gender pay gap has decreased by 0.6% since April 2016.
