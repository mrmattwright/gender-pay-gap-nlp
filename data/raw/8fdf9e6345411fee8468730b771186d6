ISI Inspection Report  Prior Park College has been rated ‘Excellent’ following the ISI inspection in September 2017. The new Educational Quality Inspections (EQI) report focuses on two main areas: the quality of pupils’ academic and other achievements and the quality of pupils’ personal development. Prior Park is one of the first schools judged according to the ISI’s revised framework for inspection – to be awarded the highest category ‘excellent’ in both areas is an outstanding achievement.  Key findings from the report highlight the rapid progress pupils make in their learning “and as a consequence they have outstanding achievements within and beyond the classroom.” It also notes the “great enthusiasm” demonstrated by the pupils and how “exceptionally well” students work together with their teachers, “Pupils enjoy a great deal of success in academic exams.” The inspectors recognised many areas of excellence across the College, stating the “success in a wide range of pursuits such as art and design, music and sports reflects the extensive range of talents possessed by pupils.”  It is not only in the areas of academic and co-curricular activities that Prior Park scores highly. The inspectors were equally impressed at the level of pastoral care at the College stating, “Pupils understand what is needed to keep themselves healthy both physically and mentally and have a strong sense of well-being.” The report also states, “Pupils are excellent citizens within their own community and have developed the capabilities to make wider contributions to the wider world.”  A full copy of the report is available to download from the right hand side of this page.  ISI Boarding Inspection Report  The report from our recent Boarding Standards Inspection is now available to view or download on the right. As you will see, this ‘Interim report’ is about meeting the National Minimum Standards for boarding and hence the language used is prosaic, rather than fanciful. However, the important fact is that we have met every standard and the experienced inspectors were most complimentary about our boarding community and the many colleagues who work so hard to make it a safe and happy environment for our students - a home from home. You will be pleased to know that our Prep school in Cricklade also met all standards in their inspection, which occurred at the same time.
