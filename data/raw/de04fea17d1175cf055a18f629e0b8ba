Gender Pay Report
April 2017

Produced March 2018

In 2018, we have also committed to undertaking 
talent assessments and succession planning within all 
sections of the business, so we can track career 
progression for both male and female employees on 
the programme.

We are committed to taking steps to reduce any 
gender pay gaps identified in reporting, however, we 
are also mindful, that in the industry sector in which 
we operate, this will be a long-term goal, with many 
external societal factors also playing a significant part 
in the results.

This report details the gender pay gap reporting 
requirements covered under The Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.

The regulations require companies with more than 
250 employees to publish information on their 
Gender Pay Gap.

I confirm that the Gender Pay Gap data contained in 
this report is accurate and has been produced in 
accordance with the regulations.

Rachel McDonald
Director of Human Resources

At Innserve, we pride ourselves on our highly skilled 
and competent workforce, which enables us to 
continue being an industry leader in the drinks 
dispense sector.  Regardless of gender, we simply want 
the best people to work for us, to enjoy the work we 
do, and to join with us in benefitting from our success.

We openly welcome and embrace new initiatives that 
proactively support and encourage diversity and 
inclusion in our workplace.  We are committed to the 
principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment 
for all, and we have a clear policy of paying employees 
equally for the same equivalent work, regardless of 
their gender, and other characteristics such as sexual 
orientation, disability, race, religion and belief.

For all employees, we look to reward their 
achievements by providing an opportunity to 
participate in regular and achievable incentive and 
bonus programmes, over and above their base-line 
remuneration.

Whilst we recognise that females currently play a 
significant part in our business, we acknowledge that 
this tends to be in our less-technical roles, with the 
majority of technical and engineering roles in our 
workforce still predominantly being held by males.  We 
are confident that any gender pay gap reported does 
not stem from paying men and women differently for 
the same or equivalent work they do, but rather from 
the industry sector we operate in and the differences 
in pay that technical and non-technical roles attract.
We recognise that there are steps that we can take to 
help and encourage more females into these STEM 
roles. 

We operate a flexible working policy to offer support 
to those employees looking to balance busy work and 
home life commitments and during 2017 we have 
undertaken diversity and inclusion training with our 
line managers.

Since April 2017, we have actively looked to support 
women in technical roles by increasing the number of 
female technicians we have working for us.
