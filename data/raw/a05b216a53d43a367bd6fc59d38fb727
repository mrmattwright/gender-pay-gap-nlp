 

Education Central Multi Academy Trust - Gender Pay Gap Report (31.3.17 snapshot) 

 

Education Central Multi Academy Trust (ECMAT) established in November 2012 is an employer required by law 
to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  
The Trust comprises 10 Primary and 3 Secondary Academies employing 991 staff.  The core purpose of the Trust 
is to improve the life chances of every child across the Trust.  The Trust is a public sector body and has a data 
capture (snapshot) as at 31st March 2017.  
 
Gender  Pay  Reporting  involves  carrying  out  six  calculations  that  show  the  difference  between  the  average 
earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employees data.  Under 
the Regulations there is a requirement to report on the following 6 measures: 

1.  The difference in the mean pay of full pay men and women expressed as a percentage  
2.  The difference in median pay of full pay men and women expressed as a percentage  
3.  The difference in mean bonus pay of full pay men and women expressed as a percentage  
4.  The difference in median bonus pay of men and women expressed as a percentage  
5.  The proportion of men and women who received bonus pay and  
6.  The proportion of full pay men and women in each of four quartile bands  

The Trust has not paid any bonus payments over the period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 and therefore there 
is no requirement to report on measure 3, 4 and 5 above.  
 
Gender  Pay  Reporting  requires  ECMAT  to  make  calculations  based  on  employee  gender,  which  has  been 
established using  existing  HR  and payroll records. ECMAT  is  a real  living  wage  employer  and  continues  to  pay 
teaching staff in line with School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions and support staff in  academies in line with NJC 
terms and conditions.  Central support staff (total of 6 staff) salaries are benchmarked against the Sponsor and 
paid according to work of equal value against the sector.   In relation to the other areas the data is based on 941 
staff paid on the data capture date: 176 (19%) male and 765 (81%) female. The following is the raw information.

This shows that overall, female employees were paid 27% less per hour than their male counterparts.  
 
2.    ECMAT’s Median Gender Pay Gap in hourly rate was 36% 
 
This data was calculated by listing in numerical order, from the smallest to the largest, the hourly pay rates for 
all  941  staff  employed  during  the  snapshot  period  and  selecting  the  middle  value/hourly  rate.    It  is  a  less 
accurate average than the mean as it involves comparing the mid-point in a list.  The data shows that typically 
female employees receive lower hourly rate pay than male employees.

The table shows pay quartiles by gender – with the data showing the workforce in four equal-sized groups based 
on  hourly  pay  rates,  with  Quartile  4  including  the  lowest  paid  employees  (25%)  and  Quartile  1  covering  the 
highest  paid  25%  of  employees.    50  staff  were  disregarded  from  the  calculations  due  to  being  in  receipt  of 
maternity pay, statutory sick pay or casual workers who worked less than 4 weeks as at the snapshot date.   Of 
the 941 staff, 33% were teaching staff and 63% were support staff.  A higher number of males were in the upper 
and middle quartiles for pay and a larger proportion of females in the lower pay quartiles.

Teaching staff complement across the Trust - 314 teachers were employed, 33% of total relevant staff (main 
and upper pay range, lead practitioners, TLR post holders, phase leaders and Assistant Headteachers).   

In Secondary - 181 (58%) teachers were employed of which 105 are Female (58%) and 76 are Male (42%)  
In Primary – 132 (42%) teachers were employed of which 114 are Female (86%) and 18 are Male (14%) 

•

The pay gap within the teaching workforce is 5%, which is low. 
 
Support staff complement across the Trust – 595 support staff were employed, 63% of total relevant staff (all 
other supporting roles including central team). 

• 

In Secondary 172 (29%) of support staff were employed of which 125 are female (73%) and 47 are male 
(27%)

• 

In Primary 420 (70.5%) of support staff were employed of which 393 are female (94%) and 27 are male 
(6%) 

•  Within the central team there are 3 support staff all female (100%).   

 
The pay gap within the support staff workforce is 13%, which is fairly high in comparison to other types of roles 
across the Trust.  
 
There are 33 senior leadership roles within the Trust (including central team Trust Officers, Headteachers and 
Deputy Headteachers of which; 
 

•  30% of leadership roles are in secondary of which 30% are male and 70% are female  
•  9% of the leadership roles are in the MAT central team 67% are female and 33% male  
•  61% of leadership posts are in primary of which 65% are female and 35% male 

 
The pay gap within senior leadership roles is -0.16% which demonstrates that females are paid equal to their 
male counterparts across the Trust. 
 
5.     What are the underlying causes of ECMAT’s gender pay gap? 
 
The workforce is treated equally in relation to pay, regardless of gender where they are employed to undertake 
work; of equal value, work that is broadly the same or similar and work that has been rated as equivalent under 
a job evaluation scheme.  It is on this basis that the Trust is confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from 
paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work but more likely as a result of: 

  The roles individuals apply for due to their skills/experience/knowledge and personal circumstances:  e.g. A 
large  proportion  of  lower  paid  roles  are  part-time  and/or  term  time  only  –  this  gives  staff  flexibility  in 
relation to maintaining a work-life balance (53% of part-time employees (496) are female compared to only 
50 males (5%).  A large proportion of support staff roles which are graded higher are undertaken by males 
e.g.  Site  Managers,  Business  Managers,  HLTA’s  in  comparison  to  lower  graded  roles  such  as  lunchtime 
supervisors/cleaners. 
 

  The mean gender pay gap in the central team is high (34%) due to the small number of staff (83% female 
and 17% male) however, the Trust is confident that as the team/Trust grows the gender pay gap will balance 
out in future years.    

 
6.     How does ECMAT’s gender pay gap compare with the UK average pay gap and in the education sector? 
 
According  to  the  October  2017  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS)  Annual  Survey  of  Hours  and  Earnings  the 
mean gender pay gap for the whole economy is 17.4%, while in the education sector it is 18.3%.  At ECMAT the 
mean  gender  pay  gap  is  27%  which  is  significantly  higher  that  for  the  whole  economy  and  that  for  the  wider 
education  sector.    This  is  mainly  due  to  the  small  central  team  and  the  make  up  of  this  team.    When  you 
compare  the  gender  pay  gap  by  types  of  roles  the  pay  gap  is  in  a  range  between  0-15%,  which  is  lower  than 
national and the education sector.  The mean gender pay gap difference between male and female leaders is 0% 
(-0.16). 
 
The median gender pay gap for ECMAT is 36%, which is higher than the median gender pay gap in the education 
sector, which is 26.4% (according to the October 2017 Office for National Statistics).  However, the median pay 
gap across the different types of roles ranges between 0-13% within the Trust.   Working with both the public 
sector and specifically education, it is common for a high proportion of the workforce to be female.  The Trust 
has a 19% male workforce compared with 81% female.   It is generally recognised in education that; 

  More women apply to work in the sector due to attractive working patterns i.e. part time and term time 

contracts to work around caring responsibilities  

  Part time work can be less highly paid 
  Many female returners to employment apply to the public sector 
 

Female staff are more likely to have career breaks and may not progress into senior leadership roles

There  are  very  positive  signs  that  there  are  small  pay  gaps  within  the  support,  teaching  and  leadership  roles 
across the Trust.  
 
7.     What is ECMAT doing to address its gender pay gap? 

1.  The Trust will continue to operate fair pay policies (developing a Trust wide appraisal policy for Support 
Staff)  where  decisions  made  in relation  to  pay  progression  are  gender  neutral,  open,  transparent  and 
fair. 

2.  Monitor  recruitment  and  succession  planning  across  the  Trust  in  order  to  put  plans  in  place  to 
encourage  more  males  to  take  up  leadership  positions  and  join  the  Trust  in  the  Primary  phase  in 
particular. 

8.    Conclusion 
 
This  initial  report  and  its  data  provides  a  baseline  for  the  Trust  to  compare  to  in  future  years  to  identify  any 
trends and whether or not the actions identified above are having an impact.    The Trust is committed to the 
principle of equal opportunities in line with Equality legislation and will continue to address the gender pay gap 
whilst recognising that this alone will not remove the gap completely.
