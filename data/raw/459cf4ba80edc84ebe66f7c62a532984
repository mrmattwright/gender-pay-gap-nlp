This is defined as:   The mean and median differences in male vs female pay  The mean and median differences in male vs female bonuses  The respective proportions of male vs female employees receiving bonuses  The respective proportions of male vs female employees in each of four 'quartiles' (or salary brackets) in the organisation's pay structure   Our analysis in line with these requirements is favourable when compared to the UK as a whole, but does highlight an issue we are aware of as a business – the relative lack of women at a senior level across some areas of our company. This, and also the fact that many of our shift workers are male, has a negative impact on our overall data.  As part of Pernod Ricard globally, and also as Chivas Brothers in the UK, we are dedicated to ensuring a better balance across all sectors, and have been working on this as a priority. We have seen some improvement as a result, and in the last six months have doubled the female representation on our Executive Team.  As a matter of course, we have a number of ‘better balance’ initiatives and now have a much more flexible working environment in place, which is aimed at enabling a better work-life balance to benefit employees and their families.  Most recently, we have made significant changes to our maternity and paternity policies to ensure we’re at the forefront in this area.  We’ll continue to look closely at this important issue.
