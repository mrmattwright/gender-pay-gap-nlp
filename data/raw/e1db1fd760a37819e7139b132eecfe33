Analysis:

This data relates to actual 
earnings in April 2017. The ratio 
of female to male employees at 
this date was 57% : 43%.

Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that in simple terms, within Your Leisure, 
females earn more than males. This relates to average (mean) earnings, median 
(midpoint) earnings and also to each quartile other than the lower middle quartile.

The (negative) pay gap can predominantly be explained by the number of female Fitness 
Class Instructors and Swim Teachers that dominate the upper quartiles.

This pay gap reporting exercise does not relate to differential pay rates for male or female 
employees undertaking the same role; at Your Leisure we have a pay rate for each role, 
regardless of the gender of the employee.

Your Leisure are committed to the principles of equality and diversity.
