Ian Black HR Manager at Mazak  I must say from the off the service I’ve received from 365 Resourcing has simply just been first class and second to none.  All information was relayed clearly and discussions were always based round me as an individual, which made it easy to fully understand what was required of myself, but most importantly an understanding of my ambitions and what I wanted in my career.  Andrew Lewis Service Coordinator  The service that I have received from 365 Resourcing has been fantastic. I haven’t had a problem that I have had to take to them so far but any minor issue or queries I’ve had have been answered in minutes. They have kept me up to date with any changes that have been made and I feel that they have been by my side since day one.
