gender
pay gap
Report 2018

We strive to be the best accountancy and financial services firm to work for, and do business 
with. A key component of our strategic imperatives is to be a true meritocracy with no hint of 
discrimination.

I want us to create a culture that encourages our colleagues, not only achieve their professional 
goals, but their personal aspirations. We want to always support our people in their personal life, 
whether that is time out to look after children or older adults or a life ambition. 

We are developing an inclusive culture and flexible working environment for us all to work in.

I am pleased to provide our gender pay gap information for Armstrong Watson LLP. Our
section on understanding the data provides more information on the key drivers of our pay gap. 
Although  our  figures  are  similar  to  the  average  within  the  financial  services  sector,  we  will  be 
working to drive this figure down. 

We believe that what is really important, is not the size of our gap in year one of our reporting, 
but the direction and speed of travel going forward. We know that it will take time, and by current 
estimates the UKs gender pay gap will exist for a further 50 years. 

Historically access to high quality part time senior roles in the professional and financial services 
sectors has been limited due to cultures that were less inclusive. We have more senior female 
managers than previously, and feel that we have equal numbers of men and women progressing 
in our firm.

We have equal access to promotion opportunities and development programme and we are
confident that everyone is paid equally for the work they do. We will continue to focus on
ensuring there is no bias in the hiring, promotion, development and retention of our people.  We 
are proud that in 2017, we recruited 50% women and 50% men to our chartered training
programme, as our chartered trainees are the future leaders of our firm.

GENDER PAY REPORT 2017
In accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017,  we 
are pleased to publish our annual gender pay gap report, based on the snapshot data ( as at 
5th April 2017, and bonuses paid between 6th April 2016 – 5th April 2017)

How we calculate the gender pay gap

The gender pay gap compares the average pay of men and women. It’s about listing salaries 
of men and women (ranked form lowest to highest) and calculating the mean/ median in each 
list. The gender pay gap is the % difference between these two figures.

Difference between the gender pay gap & equal pay

We appreciate that it is personal preference as to the roles that individuals apply for, but do
acknowledge that the gender pay gap has serious implications for women’s lifetime earnings and to 
save for retirement. 

It is easy to confuse the gender pay gap with unequal pay. The right to equal pay is an individual
contractual right which arises when there is an unjustifiable difference in the individual earnings of 
women and a men doing equal work.  The gender pay gap is a measure of the labour market in 
terms of a comparison between men and women’s average hourly rates of pay. The calculations are 
not about a man getting paid differently to women for doing the same job. 

It is not unequal pay that drives our gap because our salaries are determine by the job that our
colleagues complete.

Understanding our pay gap

In our firm, women make up 64% of our
workforce. Having a predominately female
workforce means that even small fluctuations 
in the male workforce could have a significant
impact  on  our  gender  pay  gap,  for  example 
if we had more men working in the lower pay 
quartile this would bring down our gender pay 
gap.

Our gender pay gap does not mean that we
discriminate against women. The gender pay 
gap is not purely a result of pay practices, but 
other practices, for example the high  number 
of women in roles that fall into three out of the 
four quartiles.  As there is a wide range of
salaries  for  women  and  a  concentration  of 
women  in  the  lower  quartiles  this  drives  the 
gender pay gap figure. This is compounded by 
the concentration of men in the upper quartile.

In terms of how we compare within the
sector, PWC Women in Work Index 2017
revealed that the gender pay gap in the
financial services sector sits at 34% and 23% 
in the Professional/ Technical services sector.

The data included in this report does not
include the majority of our partners
population, as partners are not classified as 
employees.

At  Armstrong  Watson  we  pay  employees 
equally for the work they do, regardless of 
sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or 
civil partners, pregnancy/maternity, sexual
orientation, gender reassignment or
disability.

How do we currently support equal access to opportunities?

•  At Armstrong Watson we have pay scales for the majority of our teams and seek always to
      appoint into roles within those bands.

•  We advertise all roles to ensure that all our colleagues have equal access. We are working
      towards each service line in our business having a succession pipeline of talent.

•  Pay awards are paid to all employees depending on the outcome of their appraisal. We
      measure colleagues on output, not inputs such as working hours.

•  We are committed to delivering to our employees “best employer bar none” and for us this
      includes helping both men and women achieve their personal and professional aspirations,           
      and ensuring that we understand personal circumstances and goals of our all colleagues and
      deliver “we’re with you”.
