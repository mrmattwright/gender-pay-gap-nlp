The gender paygap  The mean gender pay gap for the RCP for April 2017 was 12.8%, lower than the 2016 UK average for all employees, 18.1% (the latest available national figure). However, best practice is for the mean gender pay gap to be below 10%, and so as a leadership team we acknowledge that there is more to be done in reducing the gap in the coming years.  Breakdown of the RCP data  The vast majority of organisations have a gender pay gap. While acknowledging that there is more to be done to reduce the gender pay gap, we are pleased to be able to report that the gender pay gap at the RCP compares favourably with those of other organisations, including other membership organisations.  The RCP actively promotes equal pay for equal work and encourages flexible working for everyone by offering a range of different flexible arrangements across our organisation, regardless of role or level. This ensures that all our employees – both male and female – have the opportunity to work in the best way for both their career aspirations and their home life.  The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  Work on reducing the gender pay gap  The RCP, led by the executive team, is committed to fair pay irrespective of gender. We will continue to build on actions and initiatives that include the following.  Exploring future opportunities to help women progress in their careers.  Support for women returning to work.  Continuous improvement of the recruitment process and exploration of opportunities to remove unconscious bias in all stages of our recruitment process.  Encouraging men to take advantage of arrangements that enable them to fulfil their caring responsibilities.  Monitoring pay as part of our commitment to regular review of the RCP pay and reward policy.  Exploring how we can attract more female employees into senior roles in our organisation to create a more even gender pay balance.
