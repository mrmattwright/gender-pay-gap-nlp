Home    About the council    Equality and diversity         Our approach  Our approach to making Islington a fairer place.        Islington Council’s overarching vision is to make Islington a fairer place. We believe everyone should have access to the same opportunities, whatever their background or situation.  As part of our work to make the borough fairer, we have committed to eliminating discrimination, valuing diversity and looking for opportunities to build community cohesion in everything we do.  How we do this  We monitor and address unequal outcomes for different equality groups and on the basis of socio-economic status. We do this by:   Setting Equalities Objectives , which aim to address some of the main areas of inequality in Islington. Read more about our current Equalities Objectives.  Using evidence to help us to design services . We monitor equality data to help us to ensure everyone gets equal access to our services.  Completing Resident Impact Assessments (RIAs) to systematically consider the impact of our decisions on different protected groups. The council publishes all major RIAs on our website.   Our legal duty  Under the Public Sector Equality Duty (Equality Act 2010) the council has a duty to consider or think about how our policies or decisions affect people who are protected under the Equality Act. We need to show ‘due regard’ to the need to:   Eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Act.  Advance equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and people who do not share it.  Foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not share it.   Public bodies must publish information to show that they are meeting this duty by considering how their activities as employers and service providers affect people who share different protected characteristics.  This includes age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex and sexual orientation. The council has also committed to considering socio-economic status in support of our drive towards fairness.  Islington Council demonstrates ‘due regard’ of the three aims of the Public Sector Equality Duty by carrying out Resident Impact Assessments.  Equality for our employees  We have adopted  a range of policies, procedures and systems which focus on our commitment to equality of opportunity and to ensuring the dignity at work of all our employees. These include supporting flexible working, so that a balance can be achieved between family commitments and professional aspirations and payment of the London Living Wage, as a minimum.  Recent analysis undertaken to compile the gender pay gap report demonstrates that we do not discriminate against women in the remuneration of our employees.  Accessing information from the council  It is our priority to ensure that all residents have the information they need about our services, in a way which they can understand.  Our website has been designed to be accessible and usable for everyone who visits and is compatible with all modern accessibility technology.  Residents can request information from the council in a range of different formats (e.g. translations, British Sign Language, large print, easy read).  For more about the different formats and to request a translation visit the accessibility pages.
