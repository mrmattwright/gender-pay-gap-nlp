As Octavia employs more than 250 people it is required by Government regulations to publish details 
of its gender pay gap - the difference between the average earnings for men and women. The data is 
analysed as both a median pay gap, which is the middle salary when salaries are lined up from lowest 
to  highest  by  gender,  and  a  mean  pay  gap,  which  is  the  average  hourly  pay  to  a  male  or  female 
employee again regardless of the job they are in. 
 
The data for Octavia is as follows: 
 

  Median gender pay gap = 21% 
  Mean gender pay gap = 28% 
  Median bonus gender pay gap = 42% 
  Mean bonus gender pay gap = 60% 
  Percentage of women who received a bonus = 33% 
  Percentage of men who received a bonus = 41% 
  Lower quartile = 16% men and 84% women 
  Lower Middle quartile = 22% men and 78% women 
  Upper Middle quartile = 40% men and 60% women 
  Upper quartile = 41% men and 59% women 

 
The results are not an indicator of unequal pay but reflect the pay for different roles in the job market. 
Octavia is an equal pay employer – which means that we pay men and women the same pay for 
doing the same job. The figures show that: 
 

  There is no pay gap for women in Shops or Care. 

 

 
In Housing and Office roles the median favours women by 15% whilst the mean pay gap is 
9% and again reflects the jobs that men and women perform. 
  

  Looked at separately our housing activities and care and retail activities each have a gender 

pay gap that is below the ONS average, 
  

  However, when combined the mean average pay gap is 28%

Our gender pay data reflects the fact that: 
 

  We have a variety of job roles with Care, Shops, Housing and Office based staff. 
  The majority of Octavia staff are women (70%) with a high proportion of women in Care and 
Shops (89%). If there were the same number of men and women employed in care and the 
shops as the rest of the organisation the overall mean gender pay gap would fall to 5% and 
the median to minus 6% (that is, it would favour women). 
It is in adding together Care and Shop roles, where the external job market pay rates are 
lower, with Housing and office based roles where market pay rates tend to be higher, that  
results in the current balance across our results. 

 

  When we look at the organisation as a whole the upper middle and upper quartile have lower 

levels of women representation than in Octavia as a whole. 

  Performance related pay is paid as a percentage of pay. The gap reflects the market pay gap 
and the fact that the bonus scheme has not yet been rolled out to all staff. The maximum pay 
able under the scheme is 5% and in 2017 the average payment to those eligible for the 
scheme was £600. 

 
 
Action plan 
 
Octavia is taking action to promote gender equality. Over the last year we have made further senior 
female appointments including at Director level.  We will continue to take action both in the long and 
short term to address any gender pay or performance payment gaps, including  
 

  Setting up a Director led group to look into all aspects of the gender pay issue which will 

report to the Board on conclusions and recommendations 

  Completing our commitment to bring all staff onto the London Living Wage by April 2018.  
  Re-evaluating our performance related pay scheme, 
  Paying an above market rate of pay to staff in Care & Shops. 
  Bringing all staff onto an appropriate bonus scheme by 2018/19 
  Developing and encouraging female applicants for senior management positions and 

encouraging more male applicants for our care and shops roles, 

  Continuing to review all pay rates on a 3 yearly basis.  

 

Octavia is committed to ensuring that we have a gender neutral pay systems and that our action plan 
addresses any gaps identified.  
 
I confirm the data reported is accurate.
