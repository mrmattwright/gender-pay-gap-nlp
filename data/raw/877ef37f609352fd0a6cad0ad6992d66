Our 2017 gender pay gap report  Our Gender Pay Gap figures have been calculated using the mechanisms that are set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation.  The data represents all employees in the UK as at 5th April 2017.  The mean pay gap is the difference in average hourly pay between men and women.  The median pay gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly rates.  The pay quartiles are calculated by listing the rates of pay from the lowest to highest, before splitting them into four equal groups.
