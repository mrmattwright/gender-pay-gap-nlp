roles within our business. 

As a business, we have a number 
of mechanisms in place to drive 
consistency in our approach to pay 
for all colleagues, to ensure that it 
is fair.

Gender Pay Gap figures show  
a snapshot of average hourly  
pay levels, by gender, for all 
colleagues during a standard  
time period, irrespective of 
position held and/or grade. The 
graphic above shows the average 
differences between the earnings 
of males in comparison to females, 

expressed as a percentage. 

This figure is distinct from Equal 
Pay, which considers the pay for 
men and women undertaking the 
same work, or comparable roles. 
We are confident that we pay 
equitably for all colleagues who 
carry out the same or comparable 

These measures include a role 
grading system, a normalisation 
process for performance 
appraisals and a consistent 
methodology for job evaluation -  
all of which are designed to be  
free of gender bias.

BONUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN

Our annual bonus and  
incentive rewards are based  
on a structured set of criteria  
to promote consistency. 

Our bonus opportunities are the 
same for all colleagues and, 
regardless of gender, all colleagues 
have equal access to benefits 
relevant to their role.

OUR CULTURE

At Mercedes-Benz Cars UK Ltd we’re proud of our culture and continue  
to promote a working environment where our colleagues can be themselves. 
We firmly believe in appointing the best people for the best roles and have  
a number of programmes in place to support our colleagues in their 
development and to help them to realise their potential. 

Our colleagues are empowered to 
drive change within our business, 
fostering a culture of continuous 
improvement and growth. Just one of 
the ways we achieve this is by 
empowering our colleagues to run 
action groups designed around our 
key culture themes. These groups 
help to support and promote career 
rotations, agile working, CSR 
projects, and a culture of feedback 
and recognition. 

As part of our commitment to  
these culture themes, we believe  
in celebrating success. We were 
delighted when our Network 
Operations Director topped the  
Sales category in the Top 100  
British Women in the Automotive  
Industry, in a poll compiled by  
Autocar magazine, and in association 
with the Society of Motor 
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). 
We also had three additional 
Directors who were shortlisted. 

Over recent years we have seen 
encouraging progress in the social 
and economic history of the 
automotive industry. As a business, 
we have also seen significant 
progress in our gender balance. 

At Mercedes-Benz Cars UK Ltd  
we continue to drive diversity  
within our business and will 
continue to ensure all colleagues  
are offered equal opportunities  
and are fairly rewarded for the 
contribution they make. 

I confirm the gender pay gap results 
contained in this report are accurate.
