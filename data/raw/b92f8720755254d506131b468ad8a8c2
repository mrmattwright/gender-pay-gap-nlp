UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

 

This report sets out the UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017  for 
Sports Direct International plc (“Sports Direct”), prepared 
in  accordance  with  the  UK  Gender  Pay  Gap  Legislation.   
This legislation requires any UK entity with more than 250 
employees to publish their gender pay gap in six separate 
disclosures – the mean and median gender pay1 gap, the 
mean  and  median  gender  bonus2  gap,  the  proportion  of 
women and men receiving a bonus, and the proportion of 
women and men in each pay quartile. 
 
Gender  pay  gap  is  the  difference  in  the  average  pay  of 
women and men, irrespective of the type of work they do.  
It  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  men’s  earnings  –  e.g. 
women earning more than men would be expressed as a 
negative percentage.   
 
Gender pay gap is different from equal pay. Gender pay gap 
is the difference between women and men’s average pay 
across an organisation. Equal pay is about equal pay for the 
same, similar or equivalent work. 
 
In  addition  to  the  Sports  Direct  disclosure,  which  is 
voluntary, there are three entities within the Sports Direct 
Group  required  under  the  legislation  to  make  statutory 
disclosures.  These are set out later in this report.

report is accurate. 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 
1 Under the legislation, “pay” covers basic pay as well as bonus pay 
including store incentives, commission payments and holiday pay, 
and is based on data from April 2017 only.   
 
2 The “bonus” gap is based on bonuses paid in the 12-month 
reference period to 5 April 2017. 
  

 

 

 
 

 

  UNDERSTANDING THE GENDER PAY GAP 
 
Our  UK  Gender  Pay  Gap  Report  2017  provides  an 
overall business summary for all UK employees and 
engaged  workers 
in  the  Sports  Direct  Group, 
including the three entities within the Group which 
employ  more  than  250  people  (Sportsdirect.com 
Retail Limited, The Flannels Group Limited and USC 
(Republic.com  Retail  Limited)).    The  Sports  Direct 
average  gender  pay  gap  is  6.3%,  which  we  note  is 
below the current national average of 18.4%3.  
 
Sports  Direct  places  a  significant  emphasis  on 
equality  and  fairness  when  it  comes  to  earnings 
across the Group.  We continue to work vigorously 
on aligning roles and putting transparent structures 
in  place  across  all  areas  of  the  business.    When  it 
comes to rewards, Sports Direct has been a lifelong 
champion  of 
through 
performance related bonuses – we encourage all our 
people  to  reach  their  maximum  potential  and 
reward the achievement of appropriate targets set 
within the respective discipline of the business.  This 
is  reflected  in  the  high  percentage  of  males  and 
females  earning  a  bonus,  which  are  all  gender 
neutral  by  design,  and  continues  to  reflect  the 
equality  which  we  strive  to  achieve  across  our 
business.  
 
We recognise there is a difference in total earnings 
between  female  and  male  employees,  and  Sports 
Direct continues to explore and implement methods 
that will establish enhanced processes and training 
tools  for  our  employees  and  engaged  workers  to 
achieve  maximum  earning  potential  through  our 
various bonus and commission schemes.
