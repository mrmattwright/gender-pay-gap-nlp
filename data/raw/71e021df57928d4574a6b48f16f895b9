Diversity and inclusion are also key priorities for our council.  For the first time this year we are publishing a gender pay gap report in line with a new legal requirement for all public-sector bodies.  A gender pay gap report shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men and women. The difference is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings – for example women earn 3% less than men.  Used to its full potential, gender pay gap reporting is a valuable tool for assessing levels of equality in the workplace, female and male participation, and how effectively talent is being maximised.  Overall, we are pleased that our reported gender pay gap is significantly lower than the national average (4.72% vs 17.4% in all sectors).
