GENDER PAY REPORT MARCH 2018It is astounding that 100 years ago women in the UK received the right 
to vote, yet there is still a gender pay gap. However, I firmly believe 
that 2018 will be a seminal year for the industry. Diversity Initiatives 
such as the Women in Finance Charter and Gender Pay Gap reporting 
show the uncomfortable truth that the investment industry is still 
heavily dominated by males at a senior level. While the gaps are huge, 
and Hermes is sadly no exception, I see some encouraging signs of 
movement. In the same way that ESG integration was a fringe activity 
five years’ ago that has now become central to 
winning business. Whilst closing the gender pay 
gap in our industry will take time, I believe 2018 
will mark the start of an industry-wide 
commitment to greater diversity by taking 
meaningful, measurable and visible steps that 
deliver long-term change.

ABOUT HERMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
At Hermes Investment Management, we have a strong culture of 
responsibility, established long before it became fashionable in the 
industry. It is ingrained in our corporate DNA, and informs the way in 
which we behave as a firm and as individuals. Hermes was a founding 
signatory of the Women in Finance Charter and supports all forms of 
change that encourage a more diverse population across the business, 
and in particular the benefits of having a diversity of experience 
amongst senior management.

We are an asset manager with a difference. We believe that, while our 
primary purpose is helping beneficiaries retire better by providing 
world-class active investment management and stewardship services, 
our role goes further. We believe we have a duty to deliver holistic 
returns – outcomes for our clients that go far beyond the financial and 
consider the impact our decisions have on society, the environment 
and the wider world. Our goal is to help people invest better, retire 
better and create a better society for all.

We are committed to treating everyone fairly, and with dignity and 
respect. This includes all our employees (past, present and future) 
together with all of our other stakeholders, clients and service 
providers. Hermes expects all of its employees to match this 
commitment throughout their day-to-day work and activities.

At Hermes we have a strong culture of responsibility, established long 
before it became fashionable in the industry. It is ingrained in our corporate 
DNA, and informs the way in which we behave as a firm and as individuals. 
We believe we should lead by example, which is why we established the 
Hermes Pledge in 2015. To this end, we encourage all our employees to 
sign our pledge, which appears on the facing page. 

We do not tolerate any form of discrimination and expect and require that 
all employees are treated fairly, irrespective of any individual characteristics 
which are not relevant to their work. We strongly believe that diversity and 
an inclusive culture allows us to continue to grow as a strong and 
innovative organisation, delivering excellence for our clients responsibly.

DEFINING THE GENDER PAY GAP
The UK Government Equalities Office has introduced reporting 
regulation requiring employers with 250 or more employees to disclose 
annually on their Gender Pay Gap. The Gender Pay Gap is based on an 
hourly pay rate for each relevant employee, reflecting base salary and 
certain allowances. The Bonus Pay Gap includes cash bonus plus any 
proceeds on exercise of long-term incentive plans paid over the 
previous 12 months.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 Our approach to pay is gender neutral, with both male and 

female staff paid fairly for the work that they undertake. Further 
to this, we regularly evaluate our pay to ensure all staff are 
compensated fairly.

 We recognise that to close our Gender Pay Gap of 30.2% we 
need to increase senior female representation across the firm, 
in particular in Investment and Business Development.

 As a result of the Women in Finance Charter, we have set firm-
wide targets for Hermes and there has been progress with an 
increase in female employees of more than 4%, demonstrating 
that our efforts to date are having a positive impact on the 
gender diversity across the business.

 We are taking a number of actions to support attainment of our 

target goals.

Our approach to pay is gender neutral, with both male and female 
staff paid fairly for the work that they undertake. Further to this, 
we regularly evaluate our pay to ensure all staff are compensated 
fairly. Hermes staff are judged equally on their technical performance 
and their performance against the ‘Hermes Behaviours Framework’. It 
is the responsibility of every leader and manager throughout Hermes to 
create an environment where all our people can give their best, feel 
valued and be able to build upon their knowledge and skills. All staff are 
asked to adhere to the values of transparency and responsibility which 
are part of the Hermes Pledge. Demonstration of these behaviours 
forms a significant input into determining annual incentive awards. We 
believe that this approach encourages all employees to deliver high 
levels of performance and demonstrate behaviours that are in line with 
our corporate values, thus aligning the interests of management with 
other stakeholders and supporting diversity.

We recognise that to close our Gender Pay Gap of 30.2% we need to 
increase senior female representation across the firm, in particular in 
Investment and Business Development.

Historically asset management has been male dominated, due to a lack 
of females following professions requiring STEM (science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics) subjects, resulting in talent pool challenges 
and fewer females available for senior positions. While our Gender Pay 
Gap is likely to be on par with the rest of the asset management industry, 
it is simply not good enough. We need to work to change this imbalance 
across Hermes as well as the rest of the industry. Companies like ours 
need to widen the pool of people from which we recruit, encourage the 
brightest into the industry irrespective of their specific qualifications and 
create an environment that enables them to flourish and contribute over 
the long-term.
BUILDING DIVERSITY 
Actions in which Hermes is taking to support attainment of this goal 
and improvements in the employee tenure include the following:

1. TARGETS
As part of the Women in Finance Charter, we have set firm-wide 
targets for Hermes and there has been progress with an increase in 
female employees of more than 4%, demonstrating that our efforts to 
date are having a positive impact on the gender diversity across the 
business. In some areas, progress is slower than we would like due to 
the heavy gender bias within some areas of our industry. These will 
take time to address, as they require a large increase in the number of 
women entering investment management. 

In order to set realistic company targets we took a balanced and 
realistic view of our ability to move toward a complete equilibrium, 
taking in to consideration the rate of natural turnover in the business, 
future hiring needs and the availability of a diverse talent pool in 
certain sectors of the industry. Hermes will continue the positive work 
it has accomplished to date with the ultimate ambition of achieving 
gender parity across the whole business.

6. MEMBERSHIPS AND ASSOCIATIONS
a  Women in Finance Charter

We are committed to supporting the Women in Finance Charter, as 
well as supporting all forms of change that encourage a more diverse 
population across its business. We recognise the value a diverse 
workforce brings to the business and in particular the benefits of 
having a diversity of experience amongst senior management.  
Our gender diversity targets and initiatives that we have  
committed to under the charter can be viewed on our website at  
https://www.hermes-investment.com/ukw/women-finance-charter/.

b  30% Club

We are a member of the 30% Club, and believe that gender balance

but diversity further contributes to better all-round board 
performance, and ultimately increased corporate performance 
for both companies and their shareholders.

c  City Parents 

Hermes is a member of City Parents, supporting City professionals 
who have a shared interest in balancing home/family life with a 
progressive career through networking, events, seminars, coaching 
and mentoring.

7. CULTURE

Culture is an integral part of our business, which is why we have a 
number of policies and procedures in place to ensure we act as a 
transparent, responsible and ethical business. 

a  Local community

We are continuing to support the development and employability of 
females from a young age and from less privileged backgrounds in 
order to build the aggregate pipeline for talent through our support 
for local mentoring schemes and other similar community initiatives.

b  Hermes Pledge

At Hermes we have a strong culture of responsibility and believe that 
it is a far wider concept than just shareholder engagement. We 
believe we should lead by example, and we have therefore created 
the Hermes Pledge, an expression of our commitment to always act 
responsibly and transparently.

The Hermes Pledge makes clear our commitments, obligations and 
responsibilities as an organisation and as individuals. As part of the 
Pledge, staff agree to act ethically, responsibly and with integrity; to 
put the interests of our clients and their beneficiaries first, to treat 
clients, colleagues and all other stakeholders with respect and as 
they would wish to be treated

c  Hermes Behaviours

Hermes has articulated a set of behaviours innate to its culture that 
contribute to the success of the business. Every employee has a 
responsibility to act in a way that upholds Hermes’ core behaviours 
through their day-to-day activities. End of year performance ratings 
are based on the extent to which employees have demonstrated 
these behaviours as well as the extent to which they have met their 
technical performance objectives.

GENDER PAY REPORT MARCH 2018d  Women’s Network

We are establishing a Women’s Network, led by senior women 
from across the business, to engage, communicate with and 
support female members of staff.

college. A range of Hermes staff spoke directly and openly about the

and series of workshops. 

g  Hermes Unity 

We are committed to treating everyone with whom we work fairly 
and with dignity and respect. Under our Corporate Citizenship 
programme, we have established Hermes Unity, which promotes 
an inclusive culture, offering a wide range of events, allowing all 
members of staff to develop individually and collectively as an 
organisation.
