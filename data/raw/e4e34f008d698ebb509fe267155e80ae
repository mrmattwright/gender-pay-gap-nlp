OUR TEAM                         SHIMON BOKOVZA      CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER            read more  Shimon Bokovza’s restaurant concepts pair triumphant design with innovative, critically-acclaimed cuisine. A creative visionary, Bokovza’s ability to create multi-sensory brand experiences has made him an industry trend-setter for decades. As with everything he touches, Bokovza started big: At age 21, he established and built Israel’s first and only ski resort, Neve Ativ – which still flourishes today. After graduating from Cornell’s School of Hotel Administration, Bokovza began building a series of memorable restaurant brands in Philadelphia including Harvest, Apropos and the Amazon Club – the first outdoor dining/dancing spot along the Delaware. Bokovza opened the Amazon Club to NYC in the early 90s, bringing the jungle-inspired design, Brazilian soundtrack and al fresco experience to a formerly abandoned Hudson River pier. The Amazon Village NYC boasted Hudson River views of the World Trade Center, a manmade sand beach, two volleyball courts, a golf driving range, mini golf course, marina and open-air dining and dancing. He brought the concept to the Hamptons with the Amazon Sag Harbor. Bokovza opened the Kit Kat Klub, a theater-nightclub in Times Square alongside partners Danielle Billera and Matthew Johnson. Featuring burlesque entertainment and Weimar Republic-inspired décor, the Kit Kat Klub sprung to life immediately following performances of Sam Mendes’ four-time Tony Award-winning Roundabout Theater Cabaret revival. In 1999, Bokovza opened the first SUSHISAMBA in NYC, a global brand that continues to thrive today. Bokovza also curated Graffiti Gone Global, an art exhibit he created for several Art Basel Miami seasons celebrating the world’s most notorious graffiti artists. Bokovza’s other concepts include SUGARCANE raw bar grill, Duck & Waffle, and Bocce with several new and exciting brands currently in development.
