 

Ladbrokes Coral Gender Pay Gap 2017 

 

 

The  UK  Government  has  introduced  new  reporting  regulations  under  the  Equality  Act  2010 
requiring companies with over 250 employees to disclose their gender pay gap annually from April 
2017.    

This report sets  out our results in the year to April 2017 together with contextual information and 
the initiatives we have underway to close our gender pay gap.

What is a gender pay gap and how is it calculated? 

 

“Gender pay gap" is the 
difference in the average 
hourly rate of pay between 
all men and all women in a 

company 

 

What is our pay gap? 

The median hourly pay difference between male and 
female colleagues is 2.5%.   

2.5%  compares  favourably  with  the  retail  sector 
median  of  18.8%  and  the  UK  median  pay  gap  of 
18.1% across all sectors in April 2016 (source: Office 
for  National  Statistics).    However,  we  wanted  to 
understand  what’s  driving  our  pay  gap  and 
understand what we can do to improve it 

 

Gender  Pay  Gap  is  very  different  from  “Equal  Pay”. 
This  is  the  difference  in  pay  between  a  man  and  a 
woman who carry out the same or similar jobs. 

 

 

senior  levels. We  recognise this and are challenging 
ourselves to change this over time. We have recently 
implemented  programmes  to  improve  our  gender 
representation  throughout  the  Group  (see  “What 
we’ve  done  so  far”  and  “What  we’re  doing  next” 
section.  

Our overall gender pay gap 
is 2.5% which compares to a 

UK national average of 

We have conducted analysis and believe that the gap 
is  largely  a  function  of  weak  representation  at  our

Our pay quartiles 

 

Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile, each quartile containing 5,150 colleagues 

The pay quartiles show that we have a larger weighting of female colleagues in quartiles 1, 2 and 3 but a higher 
proportion of males in the highest quartile (Q4). 

Our analysis supports the opinion that the under-representation of women in highly skilled/paid roles is the main 
reason  for  the  gender  pay  gap.  Within  our  top  four  grades,  there  were  164  men  and  45  women  (see  “Gender 
profile by band” below). In addition, the majority of women in the most senior management positions are in roles 
within certain functions where salary levels are lower compared to other specialist or technical functions (such as 
finance, IT).

Pay information – bonus pay 

 

Our median bonus pay gap is 25% 

All colleagues are generally eligible to receive a bonus or incentive.  The colleagues i.e. those in retail and the 
shops,  may  receive  incentives  based  on  team  and  individual  performance.  Other  colleagues  participate  in 
annual bonus plan with the pay-out based on grade (rather than role). The median bonus pay difference of 25% 
is largely a result of a greater proportion of males at the higher grades and higher bonus levels.   

We  are  working  on  improving  female  representation  at  these  higher  grades  to  reduce  this  difference.    77%  of 
males and 80% of females were paid bonus pay.

Other pay information  

The "median" is the "middle" value in the list of numbers.  If all company colleagues lined up in a female line and 
a male line, in order of pay from highest to lowest, the median gender pay gap compares the pay of the female 
in  the  middle  of  their  line  and  the  pay  of  the  middle  man.  By  contrast  the  "mean"  is  "average"  you're  used  to, 
where  you  add  up  all  the  numbers  and  then  divide  by  the  number  of  people.  Our  mean  hourly  pay  difference 
between  male  and  female  colleagues  is  15.5%.    The  mean  bonus  pay  difference  between  male  and  female 
colleagues is 76%.

Most  bands  contain  a  variety  of  pay  families,  and 
hence  a  wide  selection  of  roles  that  offer  different 
salaries (regardless of gender).  Our analysis of pay 
levels  for  comparable  roles  shows  that  men  and 
women  are  paid  fairly  and  appropriately  for  work  of 
equal value

How Ladbrokes Coral is tackling its gender pay gap 

 

The gap in both our mean pay and mean bonus shows there’s more work to be done. And while we don’t have 
an equal pay issue across the Group, we do need to take steps to reduce our pay gap. 

That means we’re having a closer look at the structure of our workforce and in particular what we can do to get 
more women into those senior roles.  

 

 

 

What we’ve done so far 

What we will be doing 

  Pay: We have conducted detailed benchmarking 

  Parental and other leave: We are proposing to 

and ensured consistent salary positioning upon

enhance our maternity and parental leave provisions 
from the beginning of 2018, with a view to encouraging 
female colleagues to return to work.  

  Board review: Presented the current state of 
women in senior roles and discussed with the 
Board recommendations on the design of a 
female leadership programme. 

  Engaged our colleagues through a recent staff 

survey and dedicated focus groups across 
offices in Gibraltar, Ireland and the UK on HR 
policies and practices 

  Flexible working and part-time: We are re-launching a 

programme of flexible working and encouraging new 
models of working in both our retail and other 
businesses.  

  New appointments and promotions: Functions will be 
actively tasked with reviewing and challenging lists on a. 
new hire shortlisting and b. promotion to improve 
representation
