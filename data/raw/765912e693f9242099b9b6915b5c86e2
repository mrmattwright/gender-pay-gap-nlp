Our Pay and Bonus Gender Gap as at April 5th 2017:  This table shows the overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at April 5th 2017. It also shows the mean and median bonuses paid for the 2016 performance year.          Mean  Median    Hourly Pay  27.7%  14.4%    Bonus  70.2%  21.8%        Colleagues awarded a bonus:    A marginally higher percentage of women at Vanquis were paid a bonus for their performance in 2016.                                   Gender representation by pay quartiles:  The charts below present the gender distribution at Vanquis Bank across four equally sized pay quartiles. Each quartile consists of around 375 colleagues. The data shows there is a higher proportion of female colleagues in the first three quartiles, compared to the upper pay quartile.                                                     At Vanquis, we believe our gender pay gap is driven by the current structure of our workforce where we have a higher percentage of males in leadership roles. We are committed to building a better gender balance in leadership roles rather than just setting numerical targets and believe this can be achieved by having more focussed action around attracting, retaining and developing female talent to reach leadership roles.    As part of the Provident Financial Group, we know that our long-term success relies on ensuring that we reflect the many diverse communities we serve so that we’re able to deliver the products and services that our customers need.    I confirm that the data presented in this statement is accurate.

Missing payments could have severe consequences and make obtaining credit more difficult.  To build your credit rating and be considered for credit limit increases, use your card sensibly, stay within your credit limit and pay your monthly minimum payment on time. Not doing so could harm your credit rating and ability to obtain more credit. Please also keep your other accounts such as credit cards, loans, catalogues, mobile phone and mortgages in order and don't take on too much debt elsewhere. By using your credit limits and keeping your accounts in order, you demonstrate that you can manage your accounts well and can handle the monthly repayments. There are no guarantees, but if you follow these steps consistently every month, you should be on track to improving your credit history and building a strong credit rating. Important: Credit is subject to: status; telephone contact; confirmation of name and address; not already holding a credit card issued by Vanquis Bank; no reasonable suspicion of fraud, and is only available to UK residents who are at least 18 years of age and are not legally restricted from obtaining credit e.g. because of bankruptcy.
