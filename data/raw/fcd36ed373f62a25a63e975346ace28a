Welcome to Medina College    It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the Island Innovation Federation. We are an extensive learning community, situated in Newport. Our thriving Federation encompasses Medina College, Carisbrooke College and our VI form campus. We are increasingly proud of the close collaborative working relationship that exists between all three establishments, where we are able to share an array of expertise for the benefit of over 2,000 students. A large number of students choose to study with us and join us from all over the Isle of Wight and that simple fact should tell you something about what a great experience it is to be part of our family of schools.    Each College has its own Head of School, with Karen Begley in that role at Medina, Rob Maddox at Carisbrooke and Dave Mumford at our VI form campus. In my role as Executive Headteacher, I work with all three establishments as we seek to use the expertise of our Federated Leadership Team for the benefit of all of our students and staff.  We are always welcoming when visitors wish to come and see us and we look forward to seeing you soon. You will not be disappointed.  Matthew Parr-Burman Executive Headteacher  At Medina, we are passionate about making a difference to young people’s lives and equipping them for futures in which they can achieve their aspirations. Our ethos is to relentlessly pursue outstanding teaching, learning and pastoral care, whilst maintaining the focus on the needs of the individual student. Our aim and expectation is that every student who is part of our community will achieve their best in all aspects of school life.  We have a talented team of teachers and other professionals who provide students with the best possible opportunities in a wide range of subject areas. We provide a carefully planned curriculum to ensure that whatever your child’s interests or career ambitions, we are able to provide for their needs.  Medina College is very proud of its students. The College Council and prefect teams have key roles in driving forward innovative change. There is also an active House system and an extensive extra-curricular programme which both provide incredible learning opportunities outside the classroom.  We have very strong links with our feeder primary schools and we encourage both Year 6 and Year 5 students to join us for special events throughout the year.  Outstanding education is only achieved by working in partnership with parents and carers. We want you to play a full and active role in school life, supporting your child and working with us to ensure success. We welcome collaboration and feedback about what we do well and where we could improve. Together we can ensure each student leaves us as an educated, articulate, young adult prepared to embrace the world and the challenges ahead.  I look forward to working in partnership with you to ensure the very best for your children.  Karen Begley Head of School            Twitter    What an evening for the Yr7 rugby team.
