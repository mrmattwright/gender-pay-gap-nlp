Gordonstoun’s Gender Pay Gap on 5 April 2017  There was an 18.25% mean gender pay gap (UK average 17.4%) and 17.39% median gender pay gap (UK average 18.4%). This is driven by:   Although there was an even split of male and female staff in the upper quartile of pay, the most senior roles, and therefore most highly paid roles, were occupied by men.  Lower paid roles were mostly (76%) women.   The situation in the upper quartile has changed since 5 April 2017 and there is more balance in the most senior roles.  The lower quartile and the lower middle quartile will merge over the coming years as the national living wage continues to increase.  Our direction of travel is to reduce the gender pay gap and we will continue to work on the approaches suggested in the government guidance (page 31 onwards):   Ensure that the correct policies are in place  Train and support line managers  Manage family-friendly leave successfully  Make the most of flexible working  Encourage and review career and talent development   To see the full report, click here (PDF document).
