In contrast to the sector in general, we are pleased to report that our data shows that below Associate Partner level we have a minimal gender pay gap, and we have a small positive gap in relation to bonus payments. This demonstrates that women are well represented at management levels below Partner, and that our robust performance management process results in fair pay between men and women based on performance ratings.  As with many firms in our industry, including competitors and clients, we have a wider gender pay gap when we include our Partners, since currently we have fewer women than men in senior roles. Addressing this is a clear focus for our management team and, as a firm, we are committed to increasing the proportion of women in senior management roles.
