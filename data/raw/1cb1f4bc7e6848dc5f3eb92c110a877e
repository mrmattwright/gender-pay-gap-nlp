As the world’s second largest recruitment company, Randstad strongly believes in equality, diversity 
and inclusion in all areas, including pay. 

This report, in accordance with the legislation, shows the average earnings across all levels of the 
organisation for all PAYE workers. For a staffing business like ours, this means that as well as 
corporate staff data we have also included data regarding the temporary workers that we place with 
our clients, although we have no control over their pay rates. As a result of this industry idiosyncrasy 
our data for the reporting period is showing that our gender pay gap is -18%.

In the interest of transparency in this report we also show our corporate employee data as this 
provides for a meaningful comparison in line with the spirit of the legislation.

We pride ourselves on having a best in class onboarding programme for new employees joining us, 
especially when they are entering the world of recruitment for the first time. In the last 12 months, 
54.1% of all new starters in Randstad UK were female. Through offering structured development, 
qualifications in recruitment, ongoing professional development, career progression opportunities, 
individual performance based commission, flexible working, flexible benefits and much more, we truly 
believe in the power of equal opportunities for all.

our numbers.
hourly pay - at April 2017.
mean 19.8% & median 12.6%
This data shows that females are paid 19.8% less 
than males using the mean calculation, and 
12.6% less than males using the median. These 
results are predominantly due to having more 
males in senior management positions.

bonus pay - 12 months to April 2017.  
mean 52.2% & median 43.8% 
This data shows that females are paid 52.5% less 
than males using the mean calculation, and 
43.8% less than males using the median.

proportion of males & females receiving a 
bonus.  
males: 68.8%
females: 63.8%
Bonus earnings are based on individual 
performance and are structured in the same 
manner based on seniority or type of role. 
The difference in bonus earnings can be 
predominantly attributed to factors such as 
having more males in senior management 
positions where rewards tend to be higher, 
individual performance, and due to 95% of 
our part time workers being female (the 
results do not allow us to pro-rata part time 
earnings up to be comparable).

We will continue to improve these areas, with particular focus on adopting a more agile and 
flexible approach to work.
