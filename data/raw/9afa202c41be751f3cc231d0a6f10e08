Our 2017 Gender 
Pay Gap Report

At Moat we place huge value on our people – they are the 
heart of our organisation and enable us to deliver our social 
purpose of helping as many people as possible enjoy a safe 
secure affordable home. 

We are committed to ensuring that our employees have 
an equal opportunity to develop and progress, providing 
support and training at all levels of the organisation  
from our apprentices to senior managers, helping us  
to build our future and retain an engaged, talented  
and motivated workforce.
We are confident that we pay our employees based upon 
the role that they do, irrespective of gender or ethnicity,  
and that our recruitment practices reflect the same values.
Like many housing associations, the majority of our people 
are female, partly due to a range of flexible and part time 
working options.

The overall mean gender pay gap for Moat is 21.6% which 
reflects the fact that there are significantly more women 
than men in all but the upper pay band. Taking each pay 
band in turn, the difference between male and female 
hourly rates of pay is always less than 1.5% and may  
be in favour of either men or women.
We are proud of the fact that 50% of our senior roles are 
held by women and that our Executive Team and Board 
also show an equal gender split.

In the upper pay band, men and women are equally 
represented and their average hourly rates are practically 
the same. In the other three lower pay bands a significant 
majority of employees are women and the gender 
difference in average hourly earnings is negligible.
We recognise the importance of a good work/life balance 
and a quarter of our employees opt to work part time, 
often to fit around family and other commitments.  
A significant majority (96.7%) of employees who enjoy  
this flexibility are female. 
Part time working exists in all pay bands, but is more 
prevalent amongst more administrative roles, with about 
half of all employees in the lower pay band working part 
time. Should there be a growth in the proportion of men 
working in these roles, and/or opting to work on a part 
time basis, the gender pay gap would reduce.

Moving forward

We will continue to ensure that both men and women 
have the opportunity to progress equally through the 
organisation, taking into account the needs and aspirations 
of the individual. Our talent management programme will 
be monitored to ensure that individuals are encouraged to 
reach their full potential, irrespective of gender. 
We will continue to scrutinise remuneration and promotion 
decisions to ensure that they remain free from gender bias 
and we will continue to offer flexible family friendly policies 
at all levels at Moat. 
This will underpin our future as an employer of choice, 
attracting and retaining great people with whom to  
build our future.

At Moat, we have a range of bonuses, ranging from a 
small bonus paid to almost all staff and a number of 
individual performance bonuses. The median average 
bonus for men and women is identical. 
Although a higher proportion of women than men 
received a bonus, the mean average bonus received was 
noticeably higher amongst men. This is partly because 
the number of larger bonuses, although small, has a 
significant effect on the average. The fact that the much 
more widespread company bonus is paid pro-rata for part 
time work serves to depress the average bonus figure for 
women as over 96% of part time employees are women.
