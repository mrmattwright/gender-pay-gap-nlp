Gender pay gap    Since the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011 (SDR) came into force on 10 September 2011, there has been a duty for public bodies with 150 or more employees to publish information on the diversity of their workforce. The government made gender pay gap reporting mandatory by amending the SDR so that all public sector employers with more than 250 employees have to measure and publish their gender pay gaps.  Gender pay gap reporting  Employers with 250 employees and over must publish information annually for all employees who are employed under a contract of employment, a contract of apprenticeship or a contract personally to do work. All calculations should be made relating to the pay period in which the snapshot day falls.  For the first year, this will be the pay period including 31 March 2017.
