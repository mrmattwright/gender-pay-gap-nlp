“IT’S IN OUR DNA TO DEMAND

SKILL AND DRIVE OF SOME 
AMAZING PEOPLE, BUT WE

WHAT DOES GENDER DIVERSITY MEAN  
TO NEWTON? 

We work on the toughest challenges to find sustainable improvements for the world’s most 
complex organisations. It is in our ethos to demand better in everything we do and gender 
diversity is no exception.
It will be our people, and the variety of their perspectives and talents, that will drive us to do even 
more impactful work in the future. To do this, we need to be different. Not just in the way we do 
business, but in the people we hire. 
We know we have a gender pay gap and that our future success depends on attracting and 
developing a diverse mix of people. To achieve this, we are committed to fostering an inclusive 
culture that will help our company achieve its full potential.

WHAT IS OUR COMMITMENT 
TO GENDER DIVERSITY?

The leadership at Newton want to 
create the right environment for 
gender diversity to thrive. To turn our 
intent into action, we’re making a 
clear commitment: 

40% of our entire staff 
(currently 31%) and at 
least 15% of our leadership 
(currently 0%) will be 
female by 2023, rising  
to 25% by 2028.

We are already working to improve our 
gender pay gap and have a dedicated 
programme, called Talent = Talent, 
which has been looking at:
•  continuing to broaden our 

recruitment practices

•  building an inclusive team culture
•  examining and ensuring equity in 
our people processes – especially 
around promotion

•  connecting our people to the wider 

diverse business community

•  providing a range of benefits to suit 

the needs of everyone, including 
flexible working, healthcare, time 
away from work, social activities, 
competitive family leave and 
first class personal development 
opportunities

•  producing tailored learning and 

development opportunities  
for women

WHERE DO WE NEED  
TO IMPROVE?

"TO FIND MORE SENIOR WOMEN TO HELP DRIVE 
OUR BUSINESS FORWARD WE ARE ASKING THAT 
AT LEAST 30% OF OUR SHORTLISTED CANDIDATES 
ARE WOMEN."

Our gender pay gap results show that we need 
to focus on the lack of women in our leadership 
team. At the moment, 84% of people in the 
upper quartile of our business are male. As a 
result, our mean gender pay gap in hourly pay 
is 30% and our mean bonus gender pay gap  
is 61%. 
We believe our pledge to improve our gender 
diversity will help drive further change. But 
we realise this commitment needs to be 
reinforced by action.
To find more senior women to help drive 
our business forward, we are investing in 
our employer brand so more experienced 
people want to join Newton. For the past six 
months, we have asked that at least 30% of 
our shortlisted senior candidates are women 
and our executive headhunter is a member 
of The 30% Club. Internally, we will help to 
mentor more women through the ranks and 
highlight the successes of female employees in 
management roles.

week. To help with this, we provide specific flexible 
working options (including reduced hours), time away 
from work and competitive family leave policies so 
our people can enjoy long and successful careers 
whilst realising their ambitions outside of work. We 
know there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution, so these 
agreements are always tailored to the needs and 
motivations of the individual.

WHERE ARE WE  
DOING WELL?

We’re passionate about creating high performing 
teams and rewarding everyone equally. This means 
that our gender pay gap reporting shows no instances 
of men being paid more than women for the same job 
at Newton. We’re committed to treating people fairly 
and our structured pay grades in our consulting and 
business support teams ensure that all our staff are 
paid the same for doing jobs of equal value. 
Our bonus scheme is also fair. We reward everyone 
for their contribution to the success of our business 
regardless of their position at the company, which is 
why 100% of our staff receive a bonus payment.

"OUR STRUCTURED PAY 
GRADES ENSURE THAT 
ALL OUR STAFF ARE PAID 
THE SAME FOR DOING 
JOBS OF EQUAL VALUE."

WHERE ARE WE  
GETTING BETTER?

There are two key areas we have been focusing on  
to close our overall gender pay gap: recruitment  
and retention.

RECRUITMENT
Historically, we have recruited graduates from STEM 
subjects because these people have tended to 
demonstrate the skills our business needed at the 
time. STEM is an area that has traditionally struggled 
to encourage more women to pursue these subjects, 
which is why we can now see an imbalance in our 
workforce. However, our revised recruitment methods 
now proactively recruit outside these subjects. 
Through actions such as this, our total number of 
graduate female offer holders in 2018 was 41%. In 
comparison, just 24% of STEM graduates in the UK 
were women in 2016/17.

All this means that we’re moving in the 
right direction at a graduate level. At 
the lower quartile, 43% of employees 
are women.

On a broader scale, we’re committed to encouraging 
more women to consider STEM subjects as a career. 
We work with The Smallpeice Trust to help run primary 
school STEM days and are actively involved in the 
‘Girls into Engineering’ residential school at Warwick 
University. Our volunteer work with the Social Mobility 
Foundation has also meant we’ve begun to tap into 
wider talent pools. In fact, we’ve recently hired our first 
graduates through this programme.

RETENTION
We work hard to look after our staff so they can 
strike a healthy work life balance. For example, our 
business comes together every two weeks to help 
find solutions to challenges and we have a policy not 
to work at the weekends so our people get the down-
time they need. 
However, we know the nature of consultancy means 
that people are away from home a lot during the

The Gender Pay Gap reporting legislation 
requires all companies with 250 or more 
employees to publish six pieces of key data 
around their gender pay gap. I can confirm that 
the information and data provided is accurate 
and in line with mandatory requirements.

WHAT DOES THE 
FUTURE HOLD?

We accept that there aren’t any quick fixes for 
our gender diversity challenges. But Newton 
wasn’t founded to be like other consultancies. 
We are constantly demanding the best of 
ourselves and are determined to make gender 
diversity better at our business. We know we 
still have some way to go, but it is important 
that we are taking action now to make sure we 
are on the right trajectory for the years  
to come.
Diversity means embracing everyone, 
regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, 
disability or religious beliefs. We know that 
we will only truly reach our full potential if we 
attract and retain the best people from all 
walks of life and make Newton a place where 
absolutely everyone can thrive.

"WE ARE PASSIONATE 
ABOUT CREATING HIGH 
PERFORMING TEAMS 
AND REWARDING 
EVERYONE EQUALLY."
