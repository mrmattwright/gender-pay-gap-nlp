This is the first year of gender pay gap reporting.  The report is published below along with some frequently asked questions.  University of Sussex Gender Pay Gap Report 2016-17    What is a gender pay gap?  The gender pay gap is a measure of disadvantage (a gap) expressed as a comparison between what, on average, men earn and what, on average, women earn within an organisation. Under UK legislation introduced in 2017, employers with more than 250 staff must publish their gender pay gap on an annual basis, with all organisations due to report this year by 4 April. As a public sector organisation, we have to report our data by 30 March 2018.  At Sussex we have a 15.3% median pay gap for basic pay and a 20.8% mean pay gap.  The mean gender pay gap is higher than the median as it is influenced by a small number of high earners.  The median value is a measure of the gap between the pay of a ‘typical’ male and that of a ‘typical’ female at Sussex.  Does that mean that women at Sussex are not receiving equal pay to men?  A gender pay gap is different from an equal pay gap. Equal pay is the right for men and women to be paid the same for the same/equivalent work or work of equal value. The most recent University review into equal pay conducted in December 2016 indicated that Sussex does not have an institutional equal pay issue.  What is causing the Gender Pay Gap if there is not an institutional equal pay issue?   Men and women at Sussex are paid equally for doing the same job. However, we do have an issue with the under representation of women at the higher levels of the organisation. Although the overall gender split for Sussex is 53% female: 47% male, the majority of high earners are men. For example, 69% of Grade 10 staff are male, whereas only 26% of grade 4 staff are male.  It is this under representation of women in the higher grades that leads to a gender pay gap.  The representation of men and women at Sussex by quartile is set out below and is typical for the sector.      Quartile    Men    Women      Lower quartile    32%    68%      Lower-middle   quartile    43%    57%      Upper-middle   quartile    50%    50%      Upper quartile    65%    35%                  What are we doing at Sussex to improve the representation of women?  We need to understand why women are not rising through the ranks and whether we are failing to attract women to senior posts and we will continue to investigate this. However we do have action plans to tackle these progression and recruitment issues.  The University will be taking a new approach to flexible working for all current employees as well as during the recruitment process. The University will become ‘flexible by default’. It is widely acknowledged that by offering flexible working, organisations will encourage a more diverse workforce, retain a high level of female employees, and also help women to progress.  In addition, by making our commitment to flexible working clear at the recruitment stage, it will help us attract women to new posts at all levels.  It is key that we remain focussed on improving the progression of women through the University, and how we move more women into senior roles. We will take a proactive approach to flexible working, encouraging and supporting individuals who want greater flexibility and making it easy to arrange and change. We will promote a culture where we say ‘yes’ to flexible working, unless there is a good reason to say ‘no’ and all new positions will be advertised as suitable for flexible working, unless there’s a clear business reason for not doing so.  We already have a flexible working policy so how is this different?  Our new approach to flexible working forms part of a wider Flexible Sussex strand in the University’s emerging Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. Flexible Sussex covers everything we do; flexible working is one part of this and is our initial focus for a number of reasons.  Best practice guidance on reducing gender pay gaps recommends that organisations improve flexible working to ensure that women are not permanently or temporarily excluded from the workplace and that they have access to the same opportunities to progress. At Sussex, feedback from Athena SWAN focus groups last year highlighted flexible working as a key issue and this came up again in relation to carers and also as part of our accessibility audit. Flexible working opens up greater opportunity for more people and our new approach has been designed to respond to this.  Our new focus will be on a more supportive, proactive and flexible use of a range of options such as part-time, compressed hours, working from home and job shares. It will ensure that staff and managers work together to identify the right solution from a range of options and increase awareness that flexible working does not necessarily mean part time working. It will also look at temporary flexible arrangements and making it easier to change an existing arrangement permanently or temporarily.  What else are we doing at Sussex to support women in the University to progress?   The launch of the new University-wide mentoring framework [ http://sussexmentoring.org / ] on 19 February means we are ready to set up and support more mentoring schemes in Schools and Divisions to help staff plan and develop their careers.  We are reviewing our recruitment and progression processes to ensure that they are inclusive for all staff and that they minimise the risk of unconscious bias. This review will address not only any issues facing women, but all individuals with protected characteristics, e.g. those with disabilities or from diverse backgrounds. We are starting our review with recruitment and will then conduct the same review of our promotion processes.  These initiatives won’t close the gap quickly, why doesn’t Sussex raise women’s pay to remove the problem?  The problem at Sussex is not one of equal pay. It is illegal to pay men and women differently for doing the same/equivalent work or work of equal value. The most recent University equal pay review, conducted in December 2016, identified only one pay gap by grade that requires further analysis. This was at Grade 8 (a 5.72% median pay gap in favour of men). We are investigating the cause of this gap but overall there is no suggestion that the gender pay gap is the result of an equal pay issue.  Why is the bonus gender pay gap so high?  The gap between men and women was higher for bonuses: a 50.0% median bonus gap, and a 58.2% mean bonus gap. We know that a significant factor in causing this differential is the awarding of NHS clinical excellence awards. These are paid to eligible staff and are not part of the University’s pay award and therefore not within our control. Therefore we recognise that any actions we take will only go some way towards closing this gap.  The value of non-consolidated discretionary bonuses generally increases with increasing grade. As there is a greater representation of men than women at senior grades, this will make the average bonus for men higher than that of women.  We are looking closely at the bonus gender pay gap data to understand if these two factors are the only ones creating this gap. The University is not complacent about such a large gap and will undertake a review of its discretionary pay processes (including bonuses) to ensure that they are fair and transparent and minimise the risk of unconscious bias.  Can we expect to see a reduction in the gender pay and bonus pay gaps in next year’s report?   We are committed to tackling our gender pay gap but we recognise that this will take time and commitment. The figures published are based on the year to 31 March 2017. Therefore the actions that we have announced in response are be unlikely to have had an impact on the results of the 2017-18 report as the next data collection point is 31 March 2018. We do however hope that the benefit of these initiatives will be felt by individuals during the course of the coming year and that this will be reflected in a reduction of our gender pay gap in future.
