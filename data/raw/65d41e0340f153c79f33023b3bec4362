Foreword

At Grosvenor we aim to build a diverse workforce which reflects 
the communities in which we operate in order to ensure our 
business success. We will achieve this by attracting the best 
people from as wide a pool as possible and retain them through 
an inclusive culture. This enables us to be diverse in our thinking 
and inclusive in our behaviour so that our people can express their 
views freely within the context of our values. 

What follows in this document is a review of our gender pay gap 
in response to new legislation introduced by the UK Government 
to publish the difference in the average pay between all employed 
men and women.   

Grosvenor Group is one of the world's largest privately-owned 
property businesses. We develop, manage and invest in property 
in more than 60 cities globally.  

While this document illustrates gender pay data that only relates to 
our UK-based employees, over the coming months we will extend 
our analysis to include our people based in our international 
operating companies to better inform our efforts to improve our 
gender pay performance on a global basis, and in doing so, help 
build a more equal, diverse and inclusive place to work.

What is a Gender 
Pay Gap?

A gender pay gap shows the difference in 
the average hourly pay between all men and 
women in a workforce. 

If all female employees and separately all 
male employees were listed in order of pay 
level, the median gender pay gap would 
compare the pay of the female in the middle 
of such a list with the pay of the middle man. 

The mean gender pay gap shows the 
difference in the average hourly rate of pay 
between men and women. 
 
A gender pay gap differs from an equal 
pay gap.  In the UK, it has been a legal 
requirement for companies to pay men and 
women equally for doing work of equal value 
since 1970. 

Men and women at Grosvenor are paid fairly 
and equally for doing the same job. We know 
this because for several years and every year, 
we have benchmarked the base pay of all our 
roles, both externally and internally.

Our results

Our overall pay gap in April 2017 was 27.6% on 
a median basis (middle) and 34.4% on a mean 
basis (average).

The table below illustrates the gender pay gap 
for our UK-based employees in April 2017 across 
four quartiles based on pay levels. It shows a 
relatively well balanced level of pay among our 
first three pay quartiles. 

The upper pay quartile which captures our 
most senior directors within the business 
demonstrates a significant pay gap due to this 
quartile including a predominant number of 
senior male directors and board members.  
 
In relation to bonuses, the gender pay gap 
is predominantly affected by two things: the 
calculation for bonus is not prorated for part 
time workers, and 13% of our female workers 
currently work part-time. This is the same for 
many organisations that are reporting bonus 
figures.  It is also affected by the fact that our 
senior leadership receive a greater share of 
bonuses.

Improving gender balance 
across all pay levels

We are determined to resolve the imbalance 
in gender pay at Grosvenor, which is largely 
influenced by the demographics in our highest 
pay quartile. Improving our pay gap will not 
be straightforward but it's something we are 
committed to changing.

To support our ability to build a more diverse 
business we recently launched a new Group 
Policy on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (E, D 
& I). Each of our Operating Companies (OpCos) 
is now developing new initiatives to support the 
spirit of this approach. 

Common across all of our OpCos is the desire 
to exceed the minimum standards set out 

in legislation, foster a culture that supports 
equality, diversity and inclusion and allow our 
people to be their best. 

Our priority is to appoint the best candidate for 
any given role, so we want to select from the 
widest possible pool of potential recruits, ones 
which reflect the diversity of the communities 
in which we operate. Our recruitment suppliers 
understand our requirements for a diversity of 
candidates on any shortlist.

Our focus is for all those involved in making 
recruitment and selection decisions to receive 
relevant E, D & I training and to monitor the 
data that derives from those decisions, to 

ensure that no unconscious bias impacts on the 
choices that we make. The same training will 
also be arranged for all new employees as part 
of their induction programme. 

We are introducing enhanced family-friendly 
policies ranging from flexible working through to 
equal and enhanced shared parental leave, and 
the option of maintaining better contact with 
those taking time out to care for dependents. 

It is only through the implementation of shared 
principles and approaches that we will help 
generate equal opportunities for all and help 
close our gender pay gap.
