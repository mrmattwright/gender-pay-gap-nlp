During installation window was found to be the wrong size after ripping out the old window. Although this was disappointing Abbey followed up and did some extra work to make up for the issues. It has taken time but I am much happier with the service provided.         John Reviewing Abbey Windows 3rd April 2018 Great Service

Right from our initial meeting with Neil Humphries our experience in dealing with Abbey Windows has been first class.  Neil gave us some great ideas which enhanced the conservatory design beyond our expectations.  Neil then passed us over to the installation team where each stage of the build was overseen by Elaine who kept us up to date throughout.  Every trade person who came to our house during the process was extremely professional, punctual and discreet.  I would have no hesitation in recommending them.         Steve Reviewing 5 Star Windows & Conservatories - Conservatory Installer Worcestershire 28th March 2018 After much indecision we chose 5 Star to build a Sky Room on the back of our house. This was something that we'd been contemplating for years and was so important to get right. 5 Star have left us with exactly what we wanted in a room with maximum glazing/light but one that can be used all year round. In fact we use the room more than our lounge now which says a lot for our overall satisfaction. Ok so there were a few little hurdles to overcome in the build but 5 Star were professional throughout and I couldn't recommend them enough.         Lee Reviewing Abbey Windows 21st March 2018 The customer is most definitely the focus of the staff at Abbey, brilliant job well done.
Special thanks to Danni your a star for looking after us.         Jodie Reviewing Abbey Windows 21st March 2018 I have had my family use Abbey Windows over the years and I am more than happy to recommend them to anyone. The staff are always helpful, excellent customer service. Very efficient!         Rachel Reviewing Abbey Windows 16th March 2018 I was so impressed with the fitters, Toby and Phil who did our windows a couple of days ago. Not only did they do a lovely job and make sure I was completely satisfied, they also had a nicely professional and courteous way of being with each other.         Mary Reviewing Window Wise - Conservatory Installer West Sussex 12th March 2018 Professional, reliable, helpful and friendly approach, with highest standards of workmanship, even on a small project. I highly recommend them.         Carole Reviewing Window Wise - Conservatory Installer West Sussex 9th March 2018 We had replacement windows from Window Wise and were so pleased with the service from them that we decided to have a refurbishment of our old conservatory. We now have a beautiful live-in room. Again the service and workmanship have been excellent. All the tradesmen involved have been unfailingly pleasant and a pleasure to have working round us.         Geraldine Reviewing Window Wise - Conservatory Installer West Sussex 4th March 2018 We used Window Wise to replace all doors and windows 7 years ago and were so satisfied with the work , the product and customer service that we went straight back to them to do the same in our new house. We were not disappointed! Another excellent job by experienced fitters. Very happy to recommend this company.         Valerie Reviewing Lifestyle Windows and Conservatories - Conservatory Installer Derbyshire 1st March 2018 We had our windows done by Lifestyle a few years ago and are very pleased with them, so had no hesitation going back for a new front door. The job was completed quickly and very efficiently by the friendly team, who had come out in very bad weather conditions to keep to the promised date. The door is high quality with well finished fittings and a guaranteed security lock. Everything was left clean and tidy. We're very satisfied with the work, the way it was carried out and the price we paid.         Stephen Reviewing Abbey Windows 23rd February 2018 I would highly recommend Abbey Windows.
They have such a great range of quality products coupled with outstanding customer service that is second to none.
I would highly recommend.         Jonathan Reviewing Lifestyle Windows and Conservatories - Conservatory Installer Derbyshire 21st February 2018 We used Lifestyle Windows and Doors in late 2017 to supply and fit uPVC windows, roof lantern and doors to a new extension and our existing house.  We were keen to install quality windows and chose a flush sash with grained white finish which looks fantastic.  
Having spoken with various providers, we found Chris at Lifestyle to be the easiest to deal with and his knowledge of products allowed us to choose a system which suited our needs.  Chris went the extra mile with providing cost options and was always available to speak to before, during and after the work.  Their fitters were particularly polite and skilled and were a pleasure to have in our house.  We would highly recommend Lifestyle and they will be our first choice in the future.         Lucy Reviewing Abbey Windows 21st February 2018 Abbey Windows are a really great company to work with. Very professional and friendly.
