Compassion, warmth and kindness are the top priorities for our highly trained staff.                        Our Homes  We make choosing a new home easier with our cosy, homely style. Most of our homes are purpose-built for the needs of older people. Accessibility, fresh decor and landscaped grounds set us apart from many other nursing homes.                                               Our services  All Randolph Hill nursing homes offer a warm, safe, stimulating and caring environment for older people. There are also a range of services available as and when care requirements change. We understand that levels of physical capability can change, as can mental wellbeing.                      Nursing Care  Dementia Care  Palliative Care  Specialist Care  Pre-bookable Respite                            Person centred care  The Randolph Hill Nursing Homes Group believes passionately in treating each person as an individual, because we believe that getting older doesn’t make us any less unique.  We have a holistic approach to caring for older people; we look after the whole person and their emotional and social needs, as well as their care needs. We believe in celebrating life to the full and focusing on what individuals can do, rather than what they can’t.  Our residents are at the centre of everything we do. This is our core philosophy, and the culture of our nursing homes.  Find out more                   How to choose a nursing home  Choosing a nursing home is an important decision. Follow our step-by-step guide and we'll help you make the right choice.  Although many people can feel worried and overwhelmed at the prospect of moving to a care home, once settled in the benefits are clear. The change of environment can be daunting, but our homes make the transition as smooth as possible - it's what comes with over 30 years of experience.  Find out more                   Fees and funding guide  Our care homes fees are payable by the individual, but you may be eligible for help depending on your circumstances.  You may be eligible to be council funded, where the council will pay the cost of the care home above what you can afford to pay. The council will split the bill, with a portion being sent to you to pay and the balance paid by the council.

Indeed, it has been scientifically proven that the mere action of stroking a dog, or cat, slows down the heartbeat, reduces blood pressure, and makes someone who has already suffered a heart attack much less likely to have another.  At Randolph Hill everyone enjoys the visits and loves spending time with our beloved therapets.                 What our residents and their families say         Thank you so much for the care given to my parents. I could not have wished for a better home for them in their final months. Everyone has a smile and a kind word, and nothing is too much trouble. With my heart-felt thanks and best wishes to you all.     Patricia, daughter                       Thanks for all you did for mum in the months she was in Ashley Court. She found everyone very kind and helpful, as did I.     Lucy, Joanne and Andre, children                       I have to thank all at Blenham House for the love, care and attention given to mum. Fun and laughter were always the order of the day.     Claire, daughter                       Thank you so much for all of the kindness and care you showed my mum. You were a blessing to her and me, and it was good to have her nearer.
