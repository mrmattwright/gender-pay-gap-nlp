What does the Gender Pay Gap mean? 
The gender pay gap is a point in time measurement of the difference in average 
earnings between men and women.  
The gender pay gap is a separate topic to equal pay as it is concerned with the 
differences in the average pay, regardless of role.

Our thoughts from this report 
We have already introduced bonus schemes that are linked to our Company 
balanced scorecard aligned with individual KPIs. These robust measures ensure 
we are rewarding great performance, regardless of any personal characteristics, 
when determining bonus rewards for our salaried population.  
 
We have made some significant progress in aligning pay rates and levels in recent 
years. This has been achieved through a robust benchmarking process and greater 
transparency of our pay bandings for our people. More recently, our learning & 
development interventions have a stronger emphasis on developing current skills, 
enabling future progression.  
 
We are continuing to strive to improve female representation across all levels of 
our business, but especially at senior levels.  
 
We will continue to engage with our people at all levels to understand the 
opportunities to further enhance our policies and processes. This will help to 
further develop our diversity to positively impact our culture.

Closing comments from our CEO Scott Waddington 
Our clear aim is to reduce the gender pay gap through the development of our 
culture and processes. We have a clear succession planning process in our 
business, regardless of gender, with the aim of supporting career development 
at all levels. Our approach to recruitment practises and flexible working will 
pay dividends in the future and will combat the legacy issue of working within 
a more male dominated environment. I look forward to seeing the progress 
that will be made in the coming years.
