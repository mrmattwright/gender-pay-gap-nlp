Why are we reporting these 
numbers in this way?

From 2017, organisations who employee 250 or more 
people, are required to publish statistics on their gender 
pay gap annually.

The gender pay gap shows the difference between the 
average hourly pay of men and women in an organisation.

There are six metrics that must be published annually. The 
figures are calculated using a ‘snapshot date’ which in our 
case is the 31st March 2017.
