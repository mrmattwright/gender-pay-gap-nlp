We are committed to promoting and championing a culture of diversity, fairness and equality for all our employees, potential employees, service users, carers and members of the public. We will do this by valuing and celebrating individual difference and acknowledging potential contribution to the continued development of the organisation which will in turn improve the services we provide. We are proud to be a Stonewall Star Performer.  Our Equality and Diversity policy covers all aspects of employment including vacancy advertising, the recruitment and selection process, training, conditions of service and termination of employment. To ensure that the policy is operating effectively the Trust will maintain records of employee's and applicant's age, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief, pregnancy/maternity status, marriage/civil partnership status, gender and disability.  The Trust has an Equality, Diversity and Workforce Committee which co-ordinates and supports implementation and development of the Trust's Equality and Diversity Action Plan and associated equality and diversity initiatives. Directorate equality forums also function across the Trust to drive improvements in service delivery and accessibility for 'seldom heard' communities.  Part of the Trust's Equality and Diversity Action Plan is to ensure that the composition of our workforce reflects not only the community we serve but also our service users. In reaching this goal we will strive to meet the following challenges:   to understand, value and welcome diversity throughout the range of services we provide  to measure, monitor, report on and evaluate our progress in achieving enhanced diversity, inclusion, fairness and equality to inform future service development and employment practice  to provide an opportunity for staff, service users, patients and carers to engage in the equality, diversity and inclusion agenda  to support the use of flexible working wherever possible to enable staff to achieve a better work life balance.   To celebrate Black History Month during October, Associate Director of Nursing Michelle Bateman, describes what her experience has been as a Black nurse in this short film.       Staff forums and networks  The Trust has a number of equality and diversity forums and networks which provide an opportunity for diverse groups of staff to discuss equality related issues, share good practice, and contribute to Trust policy. These include the Disability Equality Steering Group and Staff Network, Race Equality Steering Group, Age Equality Steering Group, Sexual Orientation Equality Steering Group, LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Trans) Forum, Spirituarlity and Faiths Forum and Gender Equality Steering Group. We also actively work with the network group ‘Living in Both Worlds' to support staff with mental health issues and to share and develop good practice.  Disability  The Trust has signed up to the Positive about Disabled People Standard and the Disability Standard. This means that we guarantee to interview all disabled applicants who meet the minimum criteria for any post advertised, providing the applicant has indicated on the application that they have a disability in accordance with the Equality Act 2010.  The Trust promotes and supports the employment of people who use our services. As a matter of good practice, we have service user and carer representation in our recruitment processes. For service users who use BSL as their first language this information may be useful.    The NHS has just published its Workforce Race Equality Standard Data Analysis for 2017.  This aims to ensure employees from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds have equal access to career opportunities and receive fair treatment in the workplace. From 2015 /16, WRES is included in the NHS standard contract.  Last year’s report showed that BME staff in the NHS had a lack of opportunities and career progression, suffered more harassment, bullying or abuse from patients, relatives or the public. The same experiences have been met with managers, team leaders and other colleagues.  We are pleased to send you a copy of the 2017 WRES data analysis report , which provides an overview of the data on all nine WRES indicators.  You will find some organisations have embraced the WRES and done better than others. Although there is a long way to go, there is evidence of some sustained improvements on which we will build and share what works.  Understanding the data is one of the steps in helping organisations to develop evidence-based action plans, to improve on the workforce race equality agenda.
