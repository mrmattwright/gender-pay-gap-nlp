 Proportion of Male and Female employees in each quartile 

PIA  has  a  commitment  to 
equality, attracting talent and 
boosting  staff  engagement. 
Due  to  the  nature  of  our 
business we currently employ 
328  females  and  107  males. 
Our  employees  are  mainly 
care  workers 
support

reflect on a role by role basis 
there  would  be  no  gap.  PIA
