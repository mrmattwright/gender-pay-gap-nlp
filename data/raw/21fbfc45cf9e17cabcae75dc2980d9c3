2017 GENDER PAY GAP 

REPORT  

 

What is gender pay gap? 
 

Under  new  legislation  that  came  into  force  in 
April 2017, employers with 250 or more employees 
are  now  required  to  publish  their  gender  pay 
gap.  In  accordance  with  the  Equality  Act  2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, 
employers  have  to  publish  the  difference  be-
tween the average hourly rate of pay  between 
male and female employees; the difference be-
tween the average bonus paid to male and fe-
male employees; the proportion of male employ-
ees reeving bonus; the proportion of female em-
ployees receiving bonus; and the relative propor-
tions  of  male  and  female  employees  in  each 
quartile pay band of the workforce.

‘Gender Pay Gap’ v. ‘Equal 
Pay’ 
‘Gender  pay  gap’  and  ‘equal  pay’  are 
not the same. Equal pay means that there 
should  not  be  any  pay  difference  be-
tween  men  and  women  carrying  out 

equivalent work and work of equal value. 
Gender pay gap concerns the difference 
in  average  pay  between  the  men  and 
women in the same work, equivalent work 
and work of equal value over the period, 
regardless of their job or seniority.

Gender pay gap represents any pay dif-
ferences between men and women on a 
broader level. 
 
As well as nationally, the main reason for 
gender pay gap at Signature Flatbreads is 
that  men  are  more  likely  to  be  in  senior 
roles,  or  take  up  roles  that  attract  higher 
salaries, and women are in junior roles. 
 
Hence, gender pay gap at SF reflects how 
a bigger proportion of women are in lower 
paid  roles.  Conversely,  more  women  (al-
most over 75%) work in HR, NPD, Finance, 
and  AP  Department,  therefore,  the  gen-
der  pay  gap  in  these  departments  is  dis-
proportionately  affecting  male  employ-
ees.   
 
At SF, we are confident there is no differ-
ence in pay for different genders carrying 
out  equivalent  work  and  work  of  equal 
value.

How does SF 
compare with 
other organisa-
tions?   

 

Currently  there  is  very  limited  data 
available  in  food  manufacturing  to 
allow  accurate  comparison.  How-
ever, a few similar organisations have 
submitted a  mean  gender pay  gap 
between 21.3% and 28%; and a me-
dian  gender  pay  gap  between 
20.9% and 39.8%.  

 

The  gender  pay  gap  is  an  issue  not 
only  in  manufacturing  sector,  but 
across  UK  society  and  reflects  that 
the traditional split with regard to ca-
reer  opportunities  available 
to 
women,  and  the  career  choices 
both  men  and  women  make,  is  still 
one of the main reasons gender pay 
gap exist.

What is SF doing 
to close the gen-
der pay gap? 

 

At Signature, we believe in offer-
ing equal opportunities for all. We 
are  proud  to  employ  people 
from  38  different  countries  and 
embrace diversity. We recognise 
more needs to be done in order 
to 
improve  gender  pay  gap 
across  our  business,  and  we  are 
currently  reviewing  our  recruit-
ment  processes  in  order  to  im-
prove  and  encourage  more 
women  to  take  more  interest  in 
senior roles, and careers that, so 
far,  have  not  attracted  them 
enough.

Signature Flatbreads UK Limited, Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

SF  is  a  third  generation  flatbread  bakers. 
We have grown from a small family busi-
ness  to  a  global  leader  in  flatbread  pro-
duction. As a family business, SF has a very 
low staff turnover in senior roles, yet we rec-
ognise that we must focus on attracting fe-
male talent and encourage women inter-
nally to apply for roles that are more senior. 
 

Gender  balance  has  always  been  a 
challenge  considering  the  nature  of 
the  industry  we  work  in,  but  we  are 
committed  on  reducing  the  gender 
pay gap and we will continue to strive 
towards this.
