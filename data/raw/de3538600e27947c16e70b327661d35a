Our aim is to provide an environment that is equally welcoming to people of all backgrounds, cultures, nationalities and religions.

Please contact our Communication Department at communications@hct.nhs.uk  Gender pay gap reporting  Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust is required by law to carry out gender pay reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  The gender pay gap between men and women working at Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust is currently 14.1%, against a current national mean of 17.4%.  The median hourly pay for women is 1.0% less than men. This compares favourably to the national median hourly pay where women earn 18.4% less than men.  Further work is required to understand why there are more men in certain senior roles than women, not just the differences in pay when people are actually in these roles.  For more information on how the figures break down, see the full report .  Equality Objectives  We serve diverse communities in Hertfordshire. This diversity is reflected in the profile of our patients and workforce, and brings many benefits.  Our equalities objectives set out our priorities to drive improvements in patient care, staff experience and reduce inequalities for our diverse workforce and patient population.  We are legally required to consider whether our services meet the needs of people regardless of their:   Age  Disability  Gender reassignment  Marriage and civil partnership  Pregnancy and maternity  Race  Religion or belief  Sex  Sexual orientation   The trust has set seven high level equality objectives for 2016-2017 in accordance with the Equality Act (2010). following publication of the Trust’s first Workforce Race Equality Standard Report 2015 and annual equality information report, a consultation process led to the identification of key equality objectives.  The objectives cover the areas the Trust has recognised require further action in order to meet the Public Sector Equality Duty, to:   eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation  advance equality of opportunity, and  foster good relations    Equality Objectives 2016-17:   To investigate recruitment conversion rates and develop appropriate actions  To investigate the over representation of BME groups in disciplinary cases to understand the cause  To increase staff and managers’ awareness of disability and the duty to make reasonable adjustments  To increase employment of people with learning disabilities  To improve the collection & recording of equality data for patients  To enhance the experience of patients, with disabilities with  the provision of personalised and accessible information  To improve access to services for people with learning disabilities    Each of these objectives in turn is broken down into a series of actions which support the overall goal. The Trust's Action Plan sets out what the Trust will be doing to further each of these objectives over the course of the plan.  Equality Analysis  Our policies and practices are not used by everyone in the same way and do not effect everyone in the same way. Equality analysis is a tool which helps the Trust to understand the effects of its policies and practices on staff and patients, in order to identify any improvements or amendments that might be required.  Equality analysis helps us ensure we are meeting our duties under the Equality Act 2010, helping us to gather evidence of the impact of our policies and practices on different protected groups.  Improving the care of people with learning disabilities  The Purple Star Strategy is a unique innovation developed by the Health Liaison Team at Hertfordshire County Council, in partnership with key stakeholders and aimed to prevent people with learning disabilities being disadvantaged by a lack of understanding of their needs.  Our Special Care Dental Service has a Purple Star kite mark for delivering high quality care to patients with a learning disability.  The Purple Star Practice magazine  We welcome enquiries from staff and patients on any matter related to equality and diversity. Please contact Penny Bennetts or call 01707 388047.  NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard  As part of our work to build an inclusive culture at Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust we are pleased to report on the NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES).  The WRES requires NHS organisations to demonstrate progress against nine race equality indicators. It is intended to support the career development of Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) staff and ensure the Trust workforce is representative of the communities it serves.  Our aim is to create a workforce that is as diverse as it can be at all levels of the organisation, so that we are representative of the population we serve, and our working environment is free from discrimination.
