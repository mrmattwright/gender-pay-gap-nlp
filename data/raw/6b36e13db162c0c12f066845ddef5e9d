This is the first time that the RHC has reported on the gender pay gap.  Our median gender pay gap is 5.82% and our mean gender pay gap is 16.2% but we are confident that this does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same equivalent work.  Rather it is as a result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract as well as the low staff turnover rate in roles that fall into Band D of the pay quartiles that have traditionally attracted male applicants.  There is little opportunity for progression but we encourage it wherever possible and will continue to do so and explore further opportunities through learning and development.  All our roles are benchmarked against similar organisations by an independent pay consultant (looking only at the roles and not the gender of those fulfilling them) and our pay policy is based on these findings.  We are committed to doing everything we can to reduce the gap.  Download the full report here .
