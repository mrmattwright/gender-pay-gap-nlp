Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

 
 
As a Multi Academy Trust with over 250 employees Cidari Education Limited is required to publish our 
Gender Pay Gap in line with the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) 
Regulations 2017. 
 
The Gender Pay Gap (GPG) involves carrying out calculations which show the difference in the 
average pay of men and women in the Trust across all posts. This is our first GPG Report and is 
based on data from a snapshot date of 31st March 2017. 
 
It is important to recognise that GPG is different from pay equality. Cidari is fully dedicated to gender 
and pay equality through engagement with key stakeholders, employees and unions. Adoption of the 
STPCD and NJC principles, along with a commitment to job evaluation and robust recruitment 
processes provide our organisation with surety in these areas and we continue to monitor and adopt 
best practice. 
 
Gender Pay Gap Data: 
 
On the snapshot date of 31st March 2017 Cidari had 336 employees who make up part of this data 
set.

As a Diocesan Trust values of fairness and equality are promoted and upheld at all levels at every 
opportunity. Whilst we have confidence that our processes and systems operate in full transparency 
and parity, as a senior leadership team with the support and guidance of our Board we will continue to
