At the snapshot date, 5th April 2017, there were 209 women and 128 men working across the Group. 
Our  analysis  of  our  gender  pay  gap  shows  that  it  is  largely  driven  by  the  fact  that  there  are  more 
women in higher-paid roles within the business.  

At Social Interest Group we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent 
jobs  across  our  business.  We  continue  to  take  action  to  address  any  gaps  and  to  make  sure  our 
policies and practices are fair.

The image above illustrates the gender distribution at Social Interest Group across four equally sized 
quartiles,  each  containing  just  under  85  employees.  We  are  proud  that  we  have  a  high  number  of 
women at the senior roles. 

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
