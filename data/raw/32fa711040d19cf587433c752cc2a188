We believe that by acting as a responsible global company, we will not only minimise business risk but also enhance our reputation as a business partner and employer.      ENVIRONMENT  The care we put into our products is reflected in the way we approach our environment. We aim to integrate sound environmental practices into our business and minimise the negative environmental impacts that may arise through our business operations. We comply with all current legislation, and ensure preparedness for impending relevant environmental legislative developments. We continually try to improve energy and water efficiency, and use green sourced electricity in our workshops, offices and showrooms.      SUSTAINABILTY  As a consumer of forest products, we give preference to timber and timber products that have been independently certified by a credible, global, forest certification scheme, and are derived from well managed sources for ongoing sustainability. Our policy is to recycle the majority of our waste wood products where possible and to use water based rather than solvent-based stains to help protect air quality.      EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  Canburg fully supports the principle of equal opportunities in employment and opposes all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination on the grounds of disability. No applicant or employee employed by Canburg shall receive less favourable treatment because of disability. It is in the interest of Canburg and those who work for it to ensure that all available human resource talents and skills are considered when employment opportunities arise. Canburg ensures the gender pay gap is supported and is committed to maintaining and managing a diverse workforce.  Gender Pay Gap information is available here.
