Why do we 
have a pay 
gap at Royal 
& Sun Alliance 
Insurance plc?

Our analysis shows that our 
gender pay gaps are predominantly 
driven by the shape of our 
workforce, in particular:

   We have fewer women than 
men in senior management 
roles. Our workforce is 
predominantly female (56%), 
however there is a much 
smaller proportion of women 
who are undertaking our senior 
management roles (see right, 
25%). This is reflected in our pay 
quartile data, where only 36.8% 
of employees with the highest 
paid roles are female.

   There are more women than 
men in our junior roles, such as 
customer operations, technical 
and business support.

A range of measures are needed to 
improve the gender balance in our 
organisation and reduce the gender pay 
gap, including recruitment, development 
and progression of female talent. We 
are committed, through our signature 
of the Women in Finance Charter, to 
increasing the representation of women 

in senior roles in RSA. We are also working 
collaboratively with the Gender Inclusion 
Network and with the ABI and our 
insurance peers in the Insurance Diversity 
Forum to make progress on this industry-
wide issue. Our actions to promote gender 
diversity all levels of the organisation  
are shown overleaf.

We have higher mean and median 
bonus gaps than our mean and 
median gender pay gaps.

This is influenced by:

   Our most senior roles (which are 
undertaken by more men than 
women) have larger incentive 
opportunities.

   We have a higher proportion of 
women who work part-time 
when compared to men. Where 
we have paid bonuses to  
part-time employees they are 
pro-rated to reflect the reduced 
hours – however the bonus pay 
gap calculation, as required by 
government regulations, does not 
recognise that individuals may be 
working part-time.

The gender pay gap is a measure of 
the difference between the average 
earnings for men and women.  
This is not the same as equal pay, 
and we are confident that men 
and women at Royal & Sun Alliance 
Insurance plc are paid equally for 
the same or similar work across 
the business. We undertake equal 
pay audits to check this, in line with 
ACAS and Equality and Human Rights 
Commission (EHRC) guidance.

What action are we taking to 
reduce the Gender Pay Gap?

RSA is committed to all aspects of 
diversity and inclusion, including  
actions which over time will reduce  
our gender pay gap. In 2017, RSA set 
a Group-wide target to ensure that 
women make up 33% of our  
management group by 2020.

Our group-wide Diversity & Inclusion 
Council is committed to driving change,  
led by Cathy Lewis, Group HR Director.  
To further accelerate progress, in 2017 we 
created a full-time Head of Diversity & 
Inclusion role to develop and implement 
the Group’s diversity & inclusion strategy 
and take forward the Council’s action plan.

We are taking action to promote gender diversity in the UK across the employee 
lifecycle, including:

   Recruitment of diverse talent.  
When recruiting for senior roles in  
our UK business, we require diverse 
shortlists of candidates, and monitor 
success rates of short-listed candidates 
from under-represented groups in 
receiving job offers. We have broad 
attraction strategies designed to  
ensure we appeal to a diverse mix  
of potential candidates.

   Employee resource groups.  
As part of our engagement of 
employees in shaping and giving 
feedback on our ongoing diversity  
and inclusion strategy, we have begun 
to work in partnership with employee 
resource groups to achieve improved 
diversity at RSA.

   Inclusive people policies.  
We keep our people policies  
under review to ensure that they 
continue to support our diversity  
and inclusion strategy.

   Developing and promoting  
female talent.  
Our talent programmes have been 
successful in developing new leaders  
at RSA for a number of years, and in  
2017 female and male employees  
were promoted in broadly equal 
proportions into our UK senior 
leadership population. To drive  
further progress, in 2018 we will  
further increase the number of  
female delegates attending talent 
development programmes.

Case Study

“I have recently been promoted 
to a new role as Underwriting 
Effectiveness Director for 
Commercial and given the exciting 
opportunity to build a team and lead 
a project to raise Technical Capability 
across our Commercial Underwriting 
community. But if I rewind 3 years, 
I would never have imagined that I 
would have achieved so much in my 
career in such a short space of time.

Initially I was identified by RSA as  
a high potential employee through 
our talent identification process, and 
I was targeted for development for 
future succession to a more senior 
role. This meant that the senior team 
would actively seek opportunities for 
my development and would mentor 
my career growth.

As part of RSA’s approach to 
developing talent, I received 
coaching from a senior sponsor, 
Finlay Smith, who mentored and 
sponsored me, helping me to build 
my confidence and unlock my 
potential.

Coaching provided me with the 
tools I needed to take on new 
challenges, which in turn gave 
me key exposure to other senior 
managers within the business. 
Finlay worked with me to identify 
a pivotal promotion opportunity, 
despite the role being outside his 
business function, and took time 
out to help me with interview 
coaching. One of the best aspects 
of the mentoring process is that 
senior managers recognise that the 
development and progression of 
talent is for the greater good of the 
organisation.

As a result of my experience I am  
a keen advocate of development. 
I am now excited to pay my 
experiences forward, by becoming 
the co-chair for the newly formed 
Gender Employee Resource Group, 
where I can support other women 
in progressing in their careers  
at RSA.”

Case Study

What action are we taking to 
reduce the Gender Pay Gap?

   Mentoring and networking.  
We participate in the 30% Club 
mentoring scheme, which offers  
cross-company, cross-sector  
mentoring to women. This  
programme is designed specifically  
to support female progression, and 
during 2017 we were able to offer 
mentoring to women in RSA at the 
emerging leader level. RSA is a  
member of the Gender Inclusion 
Network, an industry-wide group 
focussing on driving gender balance.

   Monitoring turnover.  
We gather feedback from leavers at 
all levels of the organisation. This data 
is reviewed by our HR team to ensure 
we understand the factors causing 
individuals to leave RSA.

   Unconscious Bias training.  
RSA employees across our UK business 
are undertaking unconscious bias 
training in a phased roll-out. This training 
will help employees to recognise where 
there may be unconscious bias to make 
sure that balanced people decisions are 
made throughout our business.

   Women in Finance Charter.  
As a signatory to HM Treasury’s Women 
in Finance Charter, we have committed 
to working collaboratively across 
financial services to build a more gender 
balanced industry. We will publicly 
report progress against our gender 
target of ensuring that women make up 
33% of our Group wide management 
team by 2020. 
 
Further information can be found here.

“The 30% Club cross company mentoring 
programme has been invaluable. As a mentee 
it has provided me with a personalised 
development opportunity with access to an 
independent and objective perspective. My 
mentor encouraged me to explore outside 
the obvious career enhancements and more 
importantly, to focus on developing as a person 
and not just a leader.”

We recognise that the gender pay  
gap is a long-term issue and actions 
will take time to have an impact on 
the figures we report. 

We are confident in the steps we are 
taking and in the monitoring we have  
in place to track their effectiveness  
and identify opportunities for  
additional actions.

Further detail our diversity and  
inclusion actions can be found in  
our Annual Report 2017.
