Executive Summary 
Mach Recruitment have two very distinct types of workers. Permanent Staff and Temporary Workers. 
Although the hourly pay rates of the temporary workers are dictated by our Clients, we can influence 
them to some degree. The results for Temporary Workers are very positive showing no difference in 
median pay for male and female Temporary Workers. There is a 2.62% difference between male and 
female Temporary workers in the Mean Average, this is explained by the fact that more male workers 
avail  themselves  of  overtime  than our  female  workforce.  The  fact  remains  that  for our  temporary 
workforce, there is no difference in hourly pay between men and women. 

For Permanent Staff there is a difference of 8.32% between male and female mean hourly earnings 
and 11.6% of median earnings. which reflects the number of male employees engaged in Management 
roles. 

Bonus Payments 

These are achieved for merit only in a delivery and compliance environment. The Median percentage 
is 0.00% as the baseline for the bonus is the same for both male and female employees. The results 
show a 40.41% difference in male and female bonus payments between male and female employees. 
50 of male and 48% of Female employees who were entitled to bonus received bonus payments. 

Quartiles 

All quartiles  within our business  are dominated by female  employees  with more females (76.92%) 
than males (26.07%) in the upper quartile. This demonstrates not only our commitment to equal pay 
for equal work but also that our industry is in fact a female dominant industry with regards to skills 
and workforce.

The Mean Gender Pay Gap 
 

The mean average involved adding up all of the numbers and dividing the result by how many 
numbers were in the list. For Mach Recruitment, it can be expressed as follows: 

Temporary Workers 
 

The calculation is: 
 
 

The result is: 

 

(𝐴 − 𝐵)

𝐴

 𝑥 100 

£8.01 − £7.80

£8.01

 𝑥 100  = 2.62% 

 

A = the mean hourly rate of all male full-pay relevant employees, B = the mean hourly rate of all female full-pay relevant employees

The Median Gender Pay Gap 
 

The median average involves listing all of the numbers in numerical order. If there is an odd number 
of results, the median average is the middle number. If there is an even number of results, the 
median average will be the mean of the two central numbers.
