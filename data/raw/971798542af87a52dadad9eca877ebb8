No bias exists in our business where men and women undertake the same role in the same part of the country.  Our industry is historically male dominated with many of our site based roles (e.g. service engineers and HGV drivers) being made up solely of male employees and the average pay for many of these roles is higher than that of the average employee. We would welcome female applicants for all roles within our business and will continue to work hard to try and make our site based roles more attractive to female applicants.  As a result of the historical male oriented nature of our industry, the more experienced people in each area of the business have a tendency to be male. This is certainly true of our director group where all but one are male. This skews the pay gap significantly.  We actively promote progression by women as evidenced by the appointment of our first female Regional Operations Manager in 2013 who progressed to Divisional Director in 2016. Her replacement as Regional Operations Manager was also female we continue to support our best people irrespective of gender and, as a result of the management pipeline training that we offer, we expect to see women continuing to succeed within our business.  It will take many years to see a substantial shift in the gender weighting of our site based roles both in our business and across our industry as a whole but we remain committed to pursuing the progression of all of our people and we remain committed to gender equality.  The company will always be committed to equal opportunity and there is no barrier to promotion and progress for any of our employees.                  Hire  Training  Sales  Safety
