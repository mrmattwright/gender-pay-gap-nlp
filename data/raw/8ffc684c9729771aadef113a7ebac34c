We are therefore committed to ensuring Bain is a workplace in which all individuals can thrive, personally and professionally, in this community of extraordinary teams. Diversity, of gender, background, ethnicity, and sexual orientation is a strategic imperative for our firm. It helps us to solve our clients' most challenging problems more effectively by ensuring diversity of ideas and thought, and to build client relationships which change behaviours and deliver true results.     OUR DATA   UNDERSTANDING OUR DATA  Meritocratic pay is a fundamental principle of our compensation at Bain & Company. At each level, base pay is standardised and bonuses are awarded based on performance versus a transparent set of metrics.  However, our mix of employees, with more men than women in our most senior consulting staff positions, causes us to have a gender pay gap when averaged across all roles and levels of the organisation. The calculated average hourly pay for women is 30% less than men, and the median salary is 36% lower for women. Looking at bonus pay, our average pay gap rises to 80%, with a median of 75%.  Although in aggregate our London Office is 47% women, our consulting team, and in particular our senior consulting team, is more skewed towards men. At our senior levels, a greater proportion of total compensation is paid as a bonus, compounding this effect in the bonus gender pay gap calculation.  In line with our focus on diversity as a strategic imperative, we are continuing to strive for gender parity at every level of the organisation.  Our recent gender parity research shows that while women start out in business with the same level of ambition as men – if not more – their aspiration and confidence drop over time. We believe that leadership teams have a key role to play in supporting women in their career progression. Globally, we are building insights and actions to help businesses address their gender parity issues and have adopted a number of practices ourselves to guide how we best recruit, develop and retain the best female talent .  Our recruiting process is underpinned by a number of targeted events to ensure that high-performing female talent aspires to work at Bain & Company, whether university or MBA graduation intake, or industry hires. We train interviewers on unconscious bias (across all types of diversity) and rigorously review our hiring processes to eliminate any effect of bias. We have hired, on average, 41% women in our Associate Consultant and Consultant programmes over the last three years.  Further, we are committed to giving all our employees the support they need to thrive in their career. For our female talent, this includes:   Active sponsorship and mentorship programmes  Targeted training and experience sharing  Focused efforts to strengthen our cultural foundation and everyday behaviours   These initiatives our shaped by our Global Women’s Leadership Council, which brings together leaders from across the firm to define our strategic priorities. Local Women@Bain affinity groups work closely with our Professional Development & Talent teams to translate this into initiatives that are fit-for-purpose for local populations.  We also believe that attracting and retaining the best talent is not just about women. It is important to us that men and women have a wide variety of career paths available, and role models pursuing them, and we strive to discuss challenges and solutions openly and honestly. Flexible career paths are available to men and women, including for example, opportunities to work part-time, rotate into alternative roles for months or years, and take leaves of absence for personal needs. We have extended our parental leave options in the UK for both mothers and fathers, and encourage new non-birth parents to take this leave. We also have a Parents@Bain group so that all parents, male and female, can share experiences and build a support network on balancing both work and family.  We are committed to ensuring Bain & Company remains a community of extraordinary teams, in which all individuals can thrive, personally and professionally. While we are far from delivering the results on gender parity that we aspire to, we are constantly looking for innovative ways to challenge ourselves and deliver meaningful results.  - Michael Garstka | Director, Bain & Company, Inc.
