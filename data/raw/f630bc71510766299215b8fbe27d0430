Our vision is to create a workplace atmosphere without bias. We work and live in an inclusive environment where all employees are visible, engaged, developed and able to bring their whole authentic selves to work.  This is critical for our business to succeed. Lorenzo Simonelli, president & CEO of BHGE said: “In this environment where disruptive change is the new normal, the ability to look at a situation from different perspectives can help us see around corners and anticipate outcomes …We serve customers in all parts of the world, on virtually every continent. To succeed with our customers, it helps if we look like our customers. It gives us a competitive advantage.”  We focus on nine areas:   Disability  Gender  Flexible Work  Race/Ethnicity  Veterans  Nationality  Generations  Sexual Orientation  Working Parents   Resources for our people  Several programs help us fulfill this vision:   Diversity Council – Our senior leaders focus on retention, exposure and promotions of critical talent across BHGE.  Diversity & Inclusion Advocates – This group of employees from around the world develops global initiatives that are executed locally.  Affinity & Employee Networks – These employee-led organizations are designed to build professional networks, develop skills and enhance career development.  Ally Alliance – All employees who demonstrate inclusive behavior and encourage fairness in the workplace.   BHGE is proud to adopt affinity and employee resource groups from both GE and Baker Hughes. These teams are propelled by the goodwill of employees, bringing value to our company and to the many communities around the world where we live and operate. Networks include:   African American Forum  Asian Pacific American Forum  Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender & Ally Alliance  Hispanic Forum  People with Disabilities Network  Veterans’ Network  Women’s Network  Middle Eastern Forum  Leaders of Tomorrow / ENDEAVOR     Balancing the equation  Closing the gender gap, especially in technical fields, is an imperative for our business. Without more women in technology and manufacturing, the talent pipeline will not be enough to meet the needs of the energy and software sectors. The promise of the digital-industrial revolution makes the stakes even higher.  BHGE will contribute to Balance the Equation, GE’s goal of having 20,000 women to fill STEM roles at GE by 2020. BHGE will also adopt GE’s employee programs and benefits that make it easier for women and working parents to balance their careers and families, including flexible work options, permissive approach to time off in the U.S. and more.  At BHGE women can find resources to advance and grow, develop their skills and empower each other across the entire span of their careers. Strategic partnerships with universities and other organizations attract more women to BHGE’s leadership development programs. We foster new ways to mentor and coach women to fuel future technical career paths, building a leadership culture that addresses unconscious bias and attracts and retains the best and brightest female talent.
