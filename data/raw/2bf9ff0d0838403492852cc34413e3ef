From 6 April 2017 employers in Great Britain with more than 250 employees will be required by 
The Equality Act 2010  (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 to publish the following four 
types of figures annually on their own website and on a government website: 
 
  Gender pay gap (mean and median averages); 
  Gender bonus gap (mean and median averages); 
  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses; 
  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure . 
 
Lincoln College is at the core of the Lincoln College Group (LCG) and incorporates three separate 
legal entities i.e. Lincoln College Corporation (LCC), Lincoln College Corporate Support Solutions 
(LCCSS) and Deans Sport and Leisure.  The Regulations require each separate legal entity (i.e. the 
employer) with at least 250 employees within a group structure to calculate and publish separate 
reports.  As such LCCSS and Deans Sport and Leisure fall outside of this obligation; however the 
legislation requires Lincoln College (as a relevant employer) to publish the statutory calculations 
(578 headcount as at 31 March 2017).  
 
LCCSS  was  established  in  October  2012  to  enable  LCC  to  conduct  its  business  in  a  more 
commercially  focused  manner,  the  company  was  formed  to  conduct  future  corporate  (non-
teaching) activities.  All corporate staff employed at that time were seconded to LCCSS and re main 
employed by Lincoln College, as such only these staff are included in the gender pay gap analysis.   

It is important to reiterate that the gender pay gap differs from equal pay.  Equal pay deals with the 
pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of 
equal value.  It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. 

The gender pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women.  

The UK gender pay gap currently stands at 17.4% (mean) and 18.4% (median) in favour of men; this 
reduces to 9.1% (median) for full time employees and 14.1% (mean); it reduces even further for 
part time employees to -5.1% (median) and 5.2% (mean) for part time staff.

Lincoln College seeks to employ a workforce that reflects the diverse community it serves, because 
it values the individual contributions of all people.  The college will treat all employees with respect 
and dignity and provide a working environment free from unlawful discrimination, harassment or 
victimisation. To this end, within the framework of the law and best practice, it is committed to 
achieving and maintaining a workforce that broadly reflects the local community. 

Based  on  the  methodology  as  outlined  in  The  Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017, Lincoln College’s mean gender pay gap is 13.7%, 3.7% lower than the UK average. 
Lincoln College’s median gender pay gap is 25.6%, 7.2% higher than the UK average.     

Unlike equal pay, which refers to paying a man and a woman the same amount for the same, or 
similar work, a gender pay gap is the difference in average pay between men and women in our 
organisation.  Lincoln  College  are  confident  that  men  and  women  are  paid  equally  for  d oing 
equivalent jobs across the organisation. 

The profile of our organisation, with more men at senior levels and significantly more women in 
the lower pay quartile means that our average male hourly rate is higher than our average female 
hourly  rate.    Furthermore,  the  Subsidiary  Company  structure  of  the  organisation  (see  1.3) 
contributes to the high median pay gap (as it excludes a significant employees) for Lincoln College 
as a stand-alone entity.  The mean gender pay gap for Lincoln College (headcount 807) including 
LCCSS  (headcount  199)  and  Deans  Sport  and  Leisure  (headcount  30)  reduces  to  12.7%  and the 
median pay gap more than halves to 10.4%.  

Although not required to report, it is worthy to note that the Mean Pay Gap for full time staff is 
10.39%  and  reduces  even  further to 7.3% for part time staff.  The Median Pay Gap fo r full time 
staff is 11.22% and 12.42% for part time staff.   

Lincoln College commit to trying to further understand the reasons behind the high proportion of 
females in the lower quartiles and part time roles (76% of all part time employees are femal e, 46% 
of all full time employees are female) to ensure that there is support for female employees with 
children/caring responsibilities, particularly how they progress at work.
