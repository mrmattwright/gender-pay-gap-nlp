With that in mind, we are publishing our first annual gender pay gap report.  We have developed an ambitious gender pay gap action plan aimed at tackling the specific issues that we have identified in our report and will monitor our pay gap closely and the impact of our actions throughout the next 12 months to ensure that we make real progress.  We will be sharing our pay gap report widely as part of our commitment to create a more open, transparent organisation that can meet its challenges head on.
