It is the first year that companies have been required to present this information and we would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that men and women are paid equally for equivalent roles at Sheppard Robson, and we work hard to create a fair, inclusive culture for all.  Our mean pay gap is 11% and our median pay gap is 10.9%.¬† As is the case across the industry, the
disparity is down to a higher number of senior men than women within the
company. This also impacts our bonus figures, with the mean gender bonus gap is
13.8% and our median figure is 25%. A full statement on our figures are included below.  Although our results are significantly better than the national
average and a number of our peers, we still feel uncomfortable with this
industry-wide disparity. In the attached document, we present our results and also anticipate how the
practice‚Äôs pay gap will look in the future and what we can do to drive
continual improvement. On the latter, we have also been collaborating closely with other leading architectural practices on how we can collectively deliver change ‚Äì we hope to report back on this shortly.
