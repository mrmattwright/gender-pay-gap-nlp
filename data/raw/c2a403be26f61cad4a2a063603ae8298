The mean gender pay gap is 4.1%.  The median gender pay gap is 0%.  The mean gender bonus gap is -101.7%.  The median gender bonus gap is -115.6%.  The proportion of male employees receiving a bonus is 36.2% and the proportion of female employees receiving a bonus is 17.8%.  Pay quartiles by gender.       BAND  MALES  FEMALES    Upper Quartile  123 74% 44 26%  Upper Middle Quartile  97 58% 70 42%  Lower Middle Quartile  122 73% 45 27%  Lower Quartile  100 60% 66 40%  The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. What are the underlying causes of our gender pay gap? Gusto Restaurants Limited is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees in accordance with the Equality Act. We have a policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic). To ensure this, we carry out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals; evaluate job roles and pay scales as necessary to ensure a fair structure and deliver Equality Training to all managers within the business. We are therefore confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. It is simply the result of the difference in roles which men and women hold within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract. Across the UK economy as a whole, men are more likely than women to be in senior roles. How does Gusto Restaurants Limited gender pay gap compare with that of other organisations? The vast majority of organisations have a gender pay gap and we are pleased to be able to say that our gap compares favourably with that of other organisations, including those within our industry. The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17.4%, while in the retail and wholesale sector it is 18.9%. At 4.1%, Our Company’s mean gender pay gap is, therefore, significantly lower than both that for the whole economy and that for our sector. The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 ONS ASHE figures) is 18.4%, while in the retail and wholesale sector it is 17.9%. At 0%, Our Company’s median gender pay gap is, therefore, significantly lower than both that for the whole economy and that for our sector. However, the reason behind this is due to the fact that vast majority of our employees are on a set rate and on the same rate of pay irrespective of gender. The mean gender bonus gap and the median gender bonus gap for our company are actually minus figures reflecting the fact that women as a whole receive higher bonuses at -101.7% and -115.6%. This is because a specific role attracting more males has a lower level of bonus attached to it, however, bonus amounts received by men and women are comparable across job roles. The proportion of male employees receiving a bonus is higher due to the difference in roles which earn a bonus. Our company’s gender pay gap compares favourably with that of organisations both across the whole UK economy and within the retail and wholesale sector, however this is not a subject about which Gusto is complacent. We are committed to doing everything that we can to reduce the gap. Gusto Restaurants Ltd has always been a Company where people can flourish and progress regardless of their gender or background and we will continue to offer fair, equitable pay to all members of our teams. I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate.
