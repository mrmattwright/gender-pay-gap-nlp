Gender pay gap report:  At DP World London Gateway we fully support the UK government's initiative to increase the transparency of pay by having companies publish their gender pay gap. We ensure diversity and inclusion is embedded within our culture so our employees are treated fairly and equally throughout their time working at DP World London Gateway. We are committed to equal pay for equal work which has been reflected in our gender hourly pay gap results. We acknowledge that our gender bonus pay gap is greater than we would like and recognise that we have to work harder to attract, recruit and retain senior professional women into our traditionally male dominated industry. We will continue to address this through our talent development and succession planning.
