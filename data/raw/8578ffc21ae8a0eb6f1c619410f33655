The above table shows our mean and median pay gap, based on hourly pay for our employees as at 5th April 2017. 

Understanding the pay gap

Our hourly gender pay gap is primarily caused by the structure of our workforce. 
Bevan  Brittan  employs  more  women  than  men,  with  a  good  representation  of 
female employees at all levels. As is the case with other firms, there are fewer 
women occupying senior roles which in line with the market, attract higher salaries.

Understanding the bonus gap

The  Bevan  Brittan  bonus  pay  gap 
influenced  by  the  fact  a  number 
of  bonus  payments  were  made  to  female  employees  with  flexible  part 
time  working  arrangements  and  these  bonus  amounts  were  pro-rated.

is 

While  the  overall  number  of  women  receiving  a  bonus  payment  was  slightly 
higher than the number of men who received one, the number of women who 
work  part  time  is  significantly  higher  than  the  number  of  men.  In  line  with  the 
reporting  regulations,  the  bonus  pay  gap  is  calculated  using  the  actual  bonus 
sums received, in contrast to the pay gap which is calculated using hourly rates.
