To meet reporting requirements, by 5 April 2018 we are publishing the results on our own website, and externally as required under the regulation.  We will continue to carry out these calculations and publish the results annually.  Surrey Choices Gender Pay Gap Reporting results indicate a negative difference in pay between our male and female colleagues (i.e. women are paid more than men).  This results from the high ratio (approximately 4:1) of women to men in our workforce – leading to a naturally higher proportion of women in more senior and managerial roles – so their average pay is higher.  However, men and women doing the same jobs are paid the same.  The results for Surrey Choices April 2017 Gender Pay Gap Data, are as follows: –  Quartile pay bands      Female  Male    Upper: 75–100% of full-pay relevant  75.00%  25.00%    Upper middle: 50–75% of full-pay relevant employees  78.00%  22.00%    Lower middle: 25–50% of full-pay relevant employees  68.00%  32.00%    Lower: 0–25% of full-pay relevant employees  68.00%  32.00%     Median and Mean Hourly Rates  Mean gender pay gap: -2.31% Median gender pay gap: -8%  Bonus Pay  Surrey Choices made no bonus payments within the relevant period.
