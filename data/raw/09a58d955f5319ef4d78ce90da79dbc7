Three years with UBM, and it still feels like the journey has just begun.  This company is dynamic and bustling with opportunities. Good processes and people provide me with the right environment and the fervour to give my best. What works for me is the way the management empowers us and helps us to succeed. We all have our ups and downs, but it’s important that we get back up again. That’s possible when we have a strong support system at work, and I am happy I’ve found this here at UBM in India.  There is this undercurrent of energy that sets this company apart, and I am glad to be a part of it. My learnings at UBM would be to embrace change and don’t be afraid to test new waters. UBM has got your back!         Andy Li  Corporate Marketing & Communications Manager   I joined UBM in 2016, as a Corporate Marketing & Communications Manager for China. I am dedicated to delivering our UBM values ( The Commitments ) and our culture both internally and externally. I especially like the UBM commitment “We do the right thing”. From a personal perspective I believe that the right motivation will lead to the right decisions and the right actions. UBMers are proud of the UBM culture.  I was fortunate to be selected as one of three delegates from UBM to attend the One Young World 2017 global forum for young leaders, in Bogota, Colombia. This was a very special experience for me. It inspired me to become a change maker for a better world, and I hope that I can spread this positive energy and passion to everyone.  As a Marketing & Communications Manager I really enjoy sharing UBM’s culture and values with our customers to improve the UBM brand image. I try to reach out to people inside and outside the company to encourage them to “do the right thing” not only in their works but also their lives. With this kind of opportunity I feel happy and satisfied working at UBM.  UBM provides a perfect platform for young people to engage with their individual career development. Also, UBM is a place full of passion and opportunities, as long as you are willing to try, nothing is impossible.         Damian Hart  EMEA Head of Recruitment   I joined UBM 18 months ago and one of the major attractions to me was the culture here. It was literally oozing out of the people I met and they all displayed a real affection for the company.  As the EMEA Head of Recruitment it’s one of my mantras to try and bottle this culture to maintain it. It’s a genuinely rare thing and needs protecting. Together with my team we look after all of the hiring activities across the UK, Amsterdam & Istanbul. It’s really broad here in terms of the roles and people we hire and it’s a fast moving and challenging environment. This is why innovations in recruitment to help us make better decisions and pioneering new training for line-managers is so key to how we work and improve. We want to attract the best talent.  So why do people love it here so much? Some people think it’s the fact that we’re constantly in a show cycle and the groups here work in tight knit teams working towards a common goal. Others think it’s the fact that as a company we do so much for the community, charity & sustainability.  As an advisor to a company that promotes neuro-diverse candidates in to the corporate world (like those with diagnosed autism, asperger syndrome and dyslexia) expanding the processes and focus on diversity and inclusion of minority groups more widely, is critical to me - as well as exposure to disadvantaged groups through volunteering and charity partnerships at UBM.  Whatever the reason, it’s a precious thing to feel you are in the right environment to achieve your goals.         Charlotte Geoghegan  Head of Content, Protection & Management Series   I’ve been at UBM since February 2015, and I absolutely love it!  I joined as Senior Content Manager and am now Head of Content for the Protection & Management series. I’m responsible for live and digital content on a portfolio of five events and two digital media sites, and I manage a team of four.  One of the things I love about UBM is the opportunity for progression. I’ve found it’s the kind of place where you get back what you put it in, so if you put yourself forward and work hard, you will be supported. A personal example of this was when I applied for the company’s international exchange programme. I spent three weeks working in San Francisco with the team behind one of our biggest events, Black Hat. I went there to pick up ideas and share best practice, and it has to be one of the most exciting opportunities I’ve had in my career.  Since joining UBM I’ve also: worked with very high profile speakers (Karren Brady, Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Sir Chris Hoy were particular highlights); developed and delivered my own training courses for internal teams across EMEA; filmed interviews backstage at the O2 Arena and down the tunnels of Crossrail; worked at events in the UK, Germany, Dubai and the USA; used ‘iVolunteer’ days to support local charities; and made friends for life.  It’s a great place to work – fast-paced, supportive and full of opportunities.         Jessie Meehan  Marketing Analyst   I see a job as more than just a means to an end. I want passion, purpose, genuine enjoyment and collaboration. And opportunity must be embedded in company culture.  When I joined UBM seven years ago, I didn’t expect what I found. Ease of identifying opportunities and being empowered by leadership to take them on. Meeting colleagues who became friends, and now are like family. Working hard, and laughing harder. And I certainly didn’t expect management championing me to keep taking on new challenges and roles — from marketing manager, to senior manager, and director within the media and publishing space — ultimately leading to where I am now, working directly with the chief marketing officer across UBM Americas to enable our event marketing teams to be as effective and efficient as possible.  At UBM, opportunities are plentiful — there are so many different teams, industry verticals, and parts of the world where we operate. If you want them, you’ll find the advocacy to work toward them.           Casey Clemenza  Communications Manager   Communication is a critical aspect of all that we do. In celebrating our successes, facing our challenges, engaging with colleagues, customers, and friends, the positioning of our message can, quite literally, make all the difference.  As a passionate communications professional, I have a fire in my belly for identifying, creating and implementing more effective and efficient ways of delivering the brand message. Some of the most exciting moments of my career have been seeing the impact that messaging can have on engaging and motivating employees through times of change.  I joined UBM in 2017, after seven years managing the internal and external communication strategy for another B2B organization working primarily in the consumer packaged goods space. At UBM, I’ve found a passionate, engaged group of people who serve customers across such a wide range of industries. One of the things that consistently excites me about working with people serving such diverse verticals, is the continued ability to bring everyone together under one resilient metaphorical roof: the importance of human moments.  We are in the business of creating connection. In a world where digital connections are the most relevant, we are proving that human connections are still the most valuable. It’s at the heart of everything we do, and that’s a message I think we can all get behind.
