Cosine…

… is an Insight led Field Sales agency, working for 
multiple clients on a variety of activities.  This leads to 
us having a varied workforce with a strong gender-
balance. 

We’re a people business, so having great people 
practices and a strong and supportive culture is 
important to us. We offer a wide range of roles, with a 
wide variety of working patterns and so flexibility is 
ingrained in our culture. We’re really pleased to be 
able to offer plenty of opportunity for both males and 
females wanting a more flexible pattern of work to suit 
their personal and family needs. 

We understand that  inclusion and diversity leads to 
greater business success and we’re proud to have a 
gender diverse leadership team. 67% of our Senior 
Leadership team is female with a 50% representation 
on the Board.

roles can then be split further into contract field 
(permanent contracts) and our flexible workforce 
(temporary work of an ‘adhoc’ nature).  

The Gender Split of the different employee groups is :

• Office
• Contract field only
• Flexible field only

What is the
gender pay  
gap?

The Gender Pay Gap looks at the overall  pay of men 
and women, not taking into account their roles or 
seniority. This means that the Gender Pay Gap is 
different to Equal Pay, which is the requirement to 
pay men and women equally for work of equal value.

Legislative requirements

All UK companies with 250 or more 
employees on 5 April 2017 are required to 
publish specific  gender pay information:
• Mean and median gender pay gap
• Mean and median gender bonus gap
• Proportion of males and females 

receiving a bonus

• Proportion of males and females by 

quartile pay band

Figures for each legal entity with at least 250 
employees on the snapshot date must be 
calculated  and reported separately.

The mean and median gender pay gap is based 
on hourly rates of pay as at 5 April 2017.

The mean and median gender bonus gap 
considers bonus pay received in the 12 months 
leading up to 5 April 2017.

Pay quartiles look at the proportion of men and 
women in four pay bands when we divide  our 
workforce into four equal parts.

Definitions:

We are required to report against mean and 
median pay gaps. 

The mean gender pay gap is the difference in 
average hourly rates of pay (or bonus 
payments) that male and female employees 
receive. This gives an overall indication of the 
gender pay gap by taking all hourly rates of 
pay and dividing by the total number of people 
in scope.

The median gender pay gap shows the 
difference in the midpoints of the ranges of 
hourly rates of pay (or bonus payments) for 
men and women by  ordering individual rates 
of pay from lowest to highest and comparing 
the middle value.

WHAT IS OUR 
GENDER PAY GAP?

At Cosine, our mean gender pay gap for hourly 
pay is  23% and the median gender pay gap 
for hourly pay is 35%.

WHAT’S THE REASON 
FOR THIS GAP?

Our overall Gender Pay Gap figure is 
predominantly driven by the fact that we have 
the highest number of women in our flexible 
workforce, where the roles attract 
comparatively lower pay.

GENDER PAY GAP BY 
EMPLOYEE GROUP

When we look at the gender pay gap within each 
group in our business community, the picture is 
significantly different and the gap is greatly 
reduced. The median pay gap for these groups is 
as follows:

Office 
Contract Field
Flexible workforce

7.9%

Proportion of males and females by pay quartile

Pay Quartile

When you split our workforce into four pay groups (quartiles) the lower two quartiles are 
predominantly female whereas the upper two are more evenly split. The lower two quartiles 
broadly represent our more flexible workforce. 

Looking at each quartile, the median pay gap is as follows:

.

Lower quartile:

Lower middle quartile:

Upper middle quartile:

Upper quartile:

11.18% -4.41%

When you break down by quartile the gender pay gap falls to neutral or a minus in all but one. 
This is because we pay men and women similar pay for doing similar work

BONUS PAY GAP 

Proportion of employees receiving a bonus at Cosine::

67%

52%

Cosine is a Field Sales business working with many different clients on 
various activities, enabling us to offer a variety of flexible roles, attractive to 
individuals who want a pattern of work to meet their personal, career and 
family needs. 

This wide range of roles, attracts a huge range of pay, benefits and incentives 
to reward and motivate the person in the role. 

When calculating the gender bonus gap, we are required to include this huge 
range of payments (varying from performance related sales commissions, to 
long-service awards, to hourly completion bonuses) and this impacts our 
overall bonus pay figure and could be quite misleading. 

Our contract field team is the only area of our business which has more males 
than females (62%/38%) and within this area we do have one particular role 
which is highly commission based. The relevant pay period happened to 
include some exceptional performance-related commission payments which 
were unusually high, which has impacted our bonus pay gap.  

Similar to our gender pay gap, when we break our workforce community into 
groups, and then look at the bonus pay gap within each group, the results look 
very different. The gap within these different groups are as follows:

Office

Through our opportunities and 
initiatives, we’re proud to  attract 
a diverse group of people and 
to give them the opportunity to
succeed.

What our people tell us

One of the best ways we can measure whether 
we have  a culture that gives people the 
opportunity to succeed, is to ask our people how 
we’re doing.

In our latest employee survey when asked about 
Diversity and Inclusion, 98% of people 
surveyed felt that Cosine treats people fairly
regardless of differences.  

Investors in People – Gold Standard

Investors in People is the benchmark of good 
people management practice and our overall 
approach has been independently assessed and 
recognised as Gold Standard.

Omnicom initiatives
As well as what we do as a business, being part 
of the Omnicom group means our employees 
can benefit from established diversity 
programmes, Omniwomen, OPEN Pride and 
OPEN.

OMNIWOMEN UK

To underscore our commitment to a 
gender inclusive environment, we  
are part of the omniwomen initiative.

In the UK we have supported an  Annual 
Summit since 2015, a forum where our 
future female leaders  find inspiration and 
mentorship.
Our goal with this event and its  subsequent 
follow up sessions,  known as basecamps, 
is to foster  an environment where women 
feel  they do not need to conform to  
“traditional” leadership stereotypes  to be 
successful, but instead can  be themselves, 
bringing their own  leadership skills and 
attributes to  our companies.

Omniwomen
Founded 2014, is dedicated to promoting  
networking and career opportunities for, and  
developing the skills of, Omnicom’s future  female 
leaders. There are chapters all over  the world, 
including New York, China, the UK  and Germany, 
to name a few!

OPEN Pride
Founded in 2016, promotes awareness,  
acceptance and advocacy by creating  
opportunities for leadership, visibility,  community 
involvement, networking and  business. Through 
its global chapters,  OPEN Pride works to foster 
an inclusive and  engaging work environment for 
Omnicom’s  LGBTQ+ community and its allies.

The Omnicom People Engagement Network
(OPEN)
The umbrella group for all official Omnicom ERGs 
and D&I activities.  It’s important to us that our 
people  encompass diverse backgrounds,  
experiences and perspectives and so
OPEN, and its respective groups, work  to foster an 
inclusive and engaging  work environment as well 
increase  networking and business opportunities.  Not 
only is this the right thing to do,  but it encourages 
fresh ideas and  thoughts that stimulate creativity and  
provide outstanding innovation.
