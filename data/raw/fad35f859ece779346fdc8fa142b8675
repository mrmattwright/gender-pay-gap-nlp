 

Imerys Minerals Limited – Gender Pay Gap Information 
 
The data presented below has been prepared in accordance with the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2007.  
The figures are taken from employee data correct as at April 2017 
payroll. 
 
Context 
 
The Company operates on a continuous basis (24/7 working) with 55% 
of  its  male  employees  working  some  form  of  shift  pattern,  including 
nights  and  weekends.    A  shift  supplement  is  paid  to  compensate  for 
working these unsociable hours and can account for up to 27% of total 
salary reported.  It should also be noted that any assessment of pay to 
comply with National Living/Minimum Wage requirements excludes shift 
pay.  If shift supplements are discounted from the data, the gender pay 
gap narrows significantly on a mean basis and becomes negative on a 
median basis, meaning females are higher paid vs males. 
More information can be found at the end of this report along with some 
key definitions.
