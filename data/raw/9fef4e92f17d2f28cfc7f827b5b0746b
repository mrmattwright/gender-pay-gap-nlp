It is a third-party certification scheme developed by the UK reinforcing steel sector to comply with BRE Globalâs BES 6001 Framework Standard for the Responsible Sourcing of Construction Products. Eco-Reinforcement enables construction clients, specifiers and contractors to purchase reinforcing steel from a supply chain which is proactively addressing issues of sustainability. In 2009, Celsa UK became the first steel mill in the world to be certified to a responsible sourcing standard, through Eco-Reinforcement accreditation for our reinforcing products. This was followed in 2010 with BES 6001 accreditation for our Other Wire Rod & Merchant Bar products.
