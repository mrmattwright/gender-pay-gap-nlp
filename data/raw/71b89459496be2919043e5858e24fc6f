Our Gender Plan aims to achieve balanced leadership, optimise talent retention and improve our clients’ experience. It builds on a number of existing initiatives and the objective is to place more emphasis on accountability, with measurable outputs against which the UK Executive Board and Practice Area Leaders can respond. As part of the Gender Plan, we have: appointed Sian Skelton to our UK Executive Board to lead on Diversity & Inclusion established an Appointments Review Committee to consider management and leadership appointments developed a set of bespoke KPIs for each practice area to monitor and track progress on key gender diversity initiatives at a practice area level These initiatives build on existing work streams, which have been developed over the last 3 years to include: enhanced maternity and shared paternity leave an agile working policy coaching for new parents across the firm continuing support for women’s leadership programmes reverse mentoring analysis of pay and bonus decisions establishing a gender diversity network and programme of internal and client-focused events Gender Pay Gap Reporting Since April 2017 businesses with 250 employees or more have been required to report on their gender pay gap. We welcome the opportunity to report on our gender pay gap. It allows us to take a closer look at its many causes and reminds us how important it is to focus on the steps we are taking to address gender equality and to promote further transparency. We are therefore approaching Gender Pay Gap reporting as part of our Gender Plan, and we hope that the steps outlined in the plan will contribute to closing our gender pay gap.
