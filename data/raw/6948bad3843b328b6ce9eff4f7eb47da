Home    About Us   Gender Pay Gap         The table below shows our mean and median gender pay gaps on rates of pay as at 5 April 2017 and our mean and median gender pay gaps on bonuses paid in the year to 5 April 2017.   Richard Irvin Energy Solutions (RIES) ensures that all opportunities are open equally to both male and female candidates, therefore these gender pay gaps are as a result of a significantly higher male population of candidates from applications received.  At the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, we had a workforce of 425 employees. Of these, 52 were female and 373 were male.  This gender imbalance is most obvious amongst our engineers, trades and management. At 5 April 2017, we had 301 engineers within our weekly paid workforce, of which 300 were male.  The gender pay gap reporting obligations do not allow us to show “real” comparisons between male and female pay for equivalent work. Within our industry, there is an overall problem with low participation of women and under representation in senior roles. Improvement will involve longer term change from companies and industry bodies.  The only way that RIES would be able to balance its gender pay gap would be to encourage more applications from female candidates. As well as helping to improve our gender pay gap, this would be desirable from a business point of view, offering a more balanced approach and diverse workforce. Going forward we will also work proactively with colleges to bring in female apprentices or trainees, as well as encourage career progression internally.
