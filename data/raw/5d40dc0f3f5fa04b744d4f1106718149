People frequently confuse the gender pay gap with equal pay, but they are not the same thing.   •  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across an organisation.   • Equal pay means that there should be no difference in the contractual terms of a woman and a man doing equal work, who both work for the same employer. At St Leger Homes we ensure men and women are paid equally for doing equal work, by determining their pay through an equality proofed job evaluation scheme.   These regulations require us to publish:     The average gender pay gap figures (mean and median)      The proportion of men and women in each quartile of the pay structure      The gender pay gap for any bonuses paid out during the year.
