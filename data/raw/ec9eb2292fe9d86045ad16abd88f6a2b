These new regulations are part of the government's efforts to close the UK's gender pay gap which currently stands at 18.4 per cent.  Employers are required to report on differences using a calculation of hourly rates and also bonus pay differences recorded on a Snapshot date of 5th April each year. The regulations detail the method of calculation and also how, when and where the information must be published.  Mego Employment Limited is confident that our male and female employees and workers are paid equally for performing equivalent work across our business. The disparity between male and female hourly rates is caused by the fact that we have a high proportion of men working in higher skilled sectors where pay rates are substantially higher and which traditionally have attracted a much lower percentage of female workers.
