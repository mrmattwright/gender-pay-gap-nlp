gender pay gap report 
2017/18 

 
Supporting Statement 
 
King’s is an equal opportunities employer who is committed to ensuring that all staff receive equal 
pay for equal work regardless of gender, ethnicity, disability or other unique characteristic.  Gender 
pay gap analysis is an important tool which allows us to continually assess if there are any areas for 
improvement. 
As boarding schools, we have a relatively high proportion of women in support roles who are paid 
at lower rates than our teaching staff and this has the effect of creating a male to female pay gap in 
the statistics. 
We have a good representation of men and women in management positions across our schools 
and are confident that women and men are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs. 
Our recruitment process is unbiased and transparent; we recruit the right people for the right job, 
regardless of gender. 
The schools are committed to ensuring women and men are given equal opportunities to progress 
into senior roles to provide the very best staff for the children. 
We consistently aim to ensure that King’s Schools remains a fair place to work and that we pass on 
this ethos to our pupils. 
 
 
I confirm that the information published in this report is, to the best of my ability, accurate:

The Data 
 
The data used in this report is taken from payroll and HR systems using a snapshot date of the  
5th April 2017.  The different pay gaps, quartiles and ratios have been calculated in accordance with 
the guidance contained in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 
 
Gender Pay Gap 
This is the difference in adjusted hourly rates between men and women; adjusted hourly rates 
include elements of ordinary pay plus any bonus payments received in the same month’s payroll.  
These adjusted hourly rates are shown as the average (mean) and the middle (median) values:

Pay Quartiles 
This is the proportion of men and women in each of the four pay quartiles.  Pay quartiles separate 
all salaries into four equal bands from the lowest paid (lower) to the highest paid (upper):

The Detail 
 
Gender Pay Gap - Contributory Factors 
Female Representation in our senior management team is currently 37.5% with the men earning 
considerably more on average due to the positions they hold within King’s Schools. 
Employee level gender pay gaps (excluding senior management team) are only 6% on average. 
Salary Sacrifice has contributed to a false inflation in our gender pay gap figures due to the 
number of female employees utilising this benefit.  Of the 31 employees in this group, 19 (61%) are 
female; because this group receives, on average, less ordinary pay than their peers the pay gap is 
exacerbated.  When these 31 individuals are removed from the calculations our gender pay gaps 
drop to 14.5% mean and 12.8% median – both well below industry and UK averages. 

 

Gender Bonus Gap – Explanation 
On first inspection the Gender Bonus Gap looks odd with the spectrum between mean and median 
spanning more than 420%, but the figures are so widely dispersed due to the fact that only eight 
men and women received bonuses and one of the bonuses was much bigger than the remaining 
seven.   
In fact, the mean gap is -379.2% because the person receiving the bigger bonus was female. 
As a pure ratio, women receiving bonuses is 50% less than their male counterparts, but on 
inspection this is a factor of role and not gender.   
 
 
Where do we go from here? 

 
Although King’s Schools conduct regular pay reviews this is the first year in which we are utilising 
data analytics to measure and track our gender pay gaps. 
We believe that understanding the contributory factors behind our figures is an important tool in 
continuing to focus on fair treatment for all our excellent staff.
