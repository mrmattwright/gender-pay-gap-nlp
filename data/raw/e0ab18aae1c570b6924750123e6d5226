Introduction

We are proud to publish our annual Equality Watch Report 2017/18 which provides information on 
our workforce in accordance with the Equality Acts (2010) Public Sector Equality Duty which came 
into force in April 2011.  The aim of the duty is to help embed equality considerations (which are 
central to delivering fair and efficient public services) into the day to day activities of public bodies. 
It  encourages  public  bodies  to  engage  with  the  diverse  communities  that  are  affected  by  their 
activities so that policies and services are appropriate and accessible to all. 
This  report  helps  monitor  our  progress  on  achieving  a  workforce  that  is  representative  of  the 
borough’s resident population. The statistical analysis also provides information on the areas where 
under-representation is apparent and helps us to identify positive actions.
The report is designed to offer a snapshot on our workforce information, more detailed information 
around equality and diversity and the Councils commitment can be found in our Equality Strategy 
www.blackburn.gov.uk/Pages/Equality-and-diversity.aspx
During the past couple of years, we have continued to find ways to manage the unprecedented 
reduction in our financial budget.  We have had to make significant reductions to job roles, reduce 
service provision and in some cases discontinue services in order to achieve savings.  Every part of 
the Council has been affected.

Creating more jobs and supporting business
Improving housing quality and building more houses
Improving health and well-being
Improving outcomes for young people
Safeguarding the most vulnerable people
Making your money go further

Our priorities
We continue to focus on spending the money left on the things people value and need the most - in 
other words, our priorities, which are:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Increased effort is also going into helping people play a greater role in improving things for us all and 
shaping our towns and improving community life through the Your Call campaign.
We remain one of the biggest employers in the borough with 69% of our employees living in the 
borough. We will be launching our new Recruitment Strategy in February 2018 which sets out themes 
to drive our recruitment activity in a timely fashion, undertaking less reactive and more pro-active 
recruitment.  It also sets out how we will maximise available technology to make the best use of 
the limited resources available, outlines our intention to start to advertise more of our vacancies 
externally and further endorses our commitment to valuing diversity and inclusivity.

Equality Watch Report 2017/18Organisational context 

We continue to find ways to manage the unprecedented reduction in the financial budget allocated 
to the authority by Central Government. Subsequently, the last twelve months have again limited 
our ability to increase areas of under-represented groups in the organisations workforce profile as 
identified in previous Equality Watch Reports.  

We have continued to manage a downsizing programme which has meant:

•  Limited opportunities to impact the workforce profile of the organisation in terms of 

under-represented protected characteristics, with external recruitment limited owing to 
the organisations priority to identify alternative employment for employees  affected by 
downsizing.

•  A reduction in the amount of internal movement within the organisation 

There  are  still  gaps  in  the  information  relating  to  our  employees  ethnicity  and  disability  status 
as employees have not chosen to provide this information however, our HR and Payroll system 
does enable employees to update their own records through a self-service approach, which should 
provide more robust and inclusive information about our workforce demographics.

We continue to be committed to ensuring a fair and diverse workforce, with equality for everyone.  
This  commitment  is  underpinned  by  our  Equality  Strategy,  Code  of  Practice  and  supported  by 
current government legislation.

An  important  part  of  quantifying  our  equality  commitment  is  to  monitor  our  workforce  profile.  
Monitoring and analysing workforce data in this way is crucial as it enables us to compare our 
workforce to our local population, identifying gaps which may need positive action, which can then 
influence our Recruitment Strategy.  Our commitment to ensuring we operate fairly and equitably 
extends beyond our workforce and also includes service delivery.  The information collected is used 
to:

• 
• 
• 

inform and develop equality objectives
inform and evolve the Council’s Recruitment Strategy
inform the work of Management Board and our associated organisational development 
objectives
inform employment policy and practices

• 
•  support departmental polices and service areas

Our People Strategy – ‘The Workforce Wheel’, continues to outline 
what we expect of our employees and what they can expect from 
us.  Ensuring equality for all employees and embracing the diversity 
of our workforce is a key element of the Strategy and inherent in all 
segments of the Workforce Wheel.

In addition, we are in the process of launching our new Recruitment 
Strategy which clearly sets out our aspirations for 2018 and beyond 
in terms of filling roles we have available.  A key part of this strategy 
is  to  start  opening  our  doors  and  recruiting  externally  where  we 
cannot fill internally, which will allow us the opportunity to influence 
our workforce diversity.

Reduction of workforce numbers 2010 - 2017

The  workforce  and  departmental  distribution  continues  to  be  determined  by  the  reduction  in 
funding meaning political drive and decision making is re-shaping the organisations service offer 
and changing our priorities.

Accordingly, the organisational headcount has continued to decrease year on year which is outlined 
in the table below as an overall organisational picture – from 3052 employees in 2010 to 2104 
employees in 2017.

The  Council  has  continued  to  make  efforts  to  prioritise  the  redeployment  of  employees  at  risk 
of redundancy so the number of vacancies recruited to externally has been kept to a minimum.  
However, we acknowledge that it is also crucial we have people with the right skills, attributes and 
experience in the right roles, so where we cannot fill roles internally, our new Recruitment Strategy 
facilitates opportunities for us to advertise and appoint externally.

Headcount

As at 30 November 2017, our workforce was made up of employees on permanent, fixed term or 
seasonal contracts, including multiple contracts, the total headcount within the Council was 2104.  
This is the total used throughout the Equality Watch Report 2017/18.    
(These figures do not include school employees, Councillors, Partnership posts or casual posts).    

Our functions are split into three Programme areas: People, Place, Resources and then further split 
into Departments, each of which delivers a specific type of service, either directly or indirectly to 
residents of the Borough.  The headcount per department is shown in the table below:

Age profile

The  table  and  graph  below  shows  the  age  profile  of  our  employees  in  comparison  to  the  local 
population  figures.  The  breakdown  remains  broadly  consistent  across  all  age  categories  as  in 
previous years. The average age of an employee here is 43.8 years.

The number of employees aged 16 – 24 is still very low when compared with the local working 
age population. We remain committed to our Annual Apprenticeship Scheme and have started 
planning for our 2018 intake.

Ethnicity profile

The tables below show the breakdown of headcount by ethnicity. Three quarters of the workforce 
are  from  a  white  ethnic  background  and  a  further  15.8%  are  from  a  BME  (Black  and  Minority 
Ethnic) background which is an increase of 0.6% from the following year. 

The  figures  compared  with  the  local  population  profile  in  relation  to  ethnicity,  demonstrate  an 
under-representation of the workforce with regards to ethnicity, as almost 15.8% of the workforce 
have stated their ethnicity to be BME compared to 30% of the working age population estimates. 

8.4% of employees have either chosen not to disclose their ethnicity by selecting ‘prefer not to 
say’ or have not updated their personal record yet so the ethnicity field remains blank.  The HR 
and Payroll system has self-service functionality which allows employees to update their personal 
records accordingly and we are keen to understand the ethnicity of all employees so are encouraging 
completion of this field.  The field is mandatory for all new starters.

Over recent years there has been limited opportunity to influence the workforce demographics with 
regards to ethnicity as the majority of recruitment has been internally from our own employees 
– however, as we launch the new Recruitment Strategy, where we advertise externally we will be 
working to raise applications from all sections of our community, working with partner organisations 
to raise awareness and encouraging interested applicants to sign up to our email alerts for vacancies 
to ensure we retain interest.

Gender Pay Report

The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations came into effect in March 2017. 
They require that organisations with 250 employees or more publish a series of statistics covering 
a number of different measures of the gap between the total pay of male and female employees. 

These measures must be published, no later than 30 March 2018 for Public Authorities, and every 
12 months thereafter. However, we have prepared ours in advance and decided to include it below: 

We were very pro-active in ensuring that a review of pay and reward was undertaken at a very early 
stage over ten years ago and we have continued to monitor the impact of this on our workforce. Men 
and women in the same role, performing equal work are paid equally, ‘same job – same pay’.  We 
actively support the progression of both men and women within the organisation and all employees 
progress proportionately.

We are proud to acknowledge that following the analysis of our gender pay gap, we are one of the 
best Local Authority performers having one of the lowest gaps within the North West.  

The Equality and Human Rights Commission reports that in the Britain, there is an overall gender 
pay gap of 18.1%

Disability profile

The table below shows the number of employees who state they have a disability.

As at 30 November 2017, 65 employees, or 3.1% of the total workforce, had declared they have 
a disability. Employees are asked at their point of entry into the organisation i.e. application form 
stage, to disclose whether they feel they have a disability. During the course of their employment, 
employees are not asked to redefine their disability status at any stage even if there have been any 
changes. We are keen to enable employees who become disabled to remain in work by providing 
reasonable adjustments to their working environment or how they carry out their duties. 

The 2011 census found that 18.1% of the local population described themselves as having a limiting 
long-term  illness.  Organisationally,  we  have  limited  data  on  the  disability  status  of  employees 
as 64% of employees have either chosen not to say or not updated their employee record. We 
are committed to continue to improve the quality of data collection for disability so this is being 
addressed as part of the continued implementation of the HR and Payroll system and self-service 
functionality. Employees are actively encouraged to update their disability status in the personal 
records section

In  December  2017  we  were  successful  in 
being 
re-awarded  our  Level  2  Disability 
Confident employer status owing to our ability 
to  demonstrate  how  we  met  our  disability 
commitments  and  this  includes  where  an 
applicant  who  declares  they  have  a  disability 
and meet the minimum selection criteria for a 
job, they will be invited to interview. Disability 
Confident replaces the Two Ticks symbol which 
has now been phased out.

It is important to acknowledge that the provision of data on disability will always be a sensitive 
one, and employees may decide not to share their disability status if they do not feel they need 
any support or reasonable adjustments to help them. We are confident that all our policies and 
procedures are equitable and fair for everyone.

From previous experience and feedback, we recognise that it can be inappropriate to ask personal 
and intrusive questions to employees and this explains why for some protected characteristics we 
hold no information or low levels of employee data.  

Nevertheless, we recognise the importance of ensuring the views of protected characteristic groups 
are captured where possible to help inform employment policies and practice.

As part of the roll-out of the new organisational Recruitment 
Strategy – ensure that we utilise all mediums to attract 
applicants from all backgrounds, ages etc from all four corners 
of the Borough.  

Use management information to analyse application sources, 
and work with appropriate partner organisations to do more 
direct targeting as necessary.

Continue to feed information into the Borough wide 
Employment and Skills Board and associated Council action 
plan around the diversity of our workforce, associated 
employment opportunities and areas of under-representation 
so a Borough wide approach can continue to be embedded.
