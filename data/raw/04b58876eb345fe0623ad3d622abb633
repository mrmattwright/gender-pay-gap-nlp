The gender pay gap measures the difference in the average hourly rate of pay including bonuses paid between all the men and women in a Company. In accordance with the regulations this information is expressed as both a mean (i.e. average) and median (i.e. the middle rate when listed in numerical order). The gender pay gap is different to “Equal Pay”, which is concerned with the legal requirement for men and women to receive the same pay for identical work. Potters Leisure Limited fully supports and implements this principle across equivalent roles throughout the business. We are committed to the principles of equal pay for all employees and will continue to regularly evaluate and measure to ensure we eliminate any gender bias in our developing pay and bonus structures taking any relevant action should any inequality be highlighted. This report provides our gender pay gap report for the snapshot date of 5th April 2017. Our findings demonstrate a positive overall position with regards to gender pay within Potters Leisure Limited. We are delighted to note that our headline figures are significantly below the national averages held at the Office for National statistics which are 17.4% for the Mean Gender Pay Gap and 18.4% for the Median Gender Pay Gap. It can be seen that we have more female roles across the company, and comparatively high female opportunities in the upper middle quartile.  We believe we compare very favourably with many businesses for the numbers of female employees in senior positions throughout the multi-disciplinary teams across the business. Our policy is and will continue to be on developing people based on talent and ability regardless of gender. Our findings are as follows: Mean Gender Pay Gap 10.8% Median Gender Pay Gap 0.5% (half of one percent) Mean Bonus Pay Gap 31.1% Median Bonus Pay Gap 44.8% Proportion of bonuses by Gender 15.1%  (Male) Proportion of bonuses by Gender 20.8% (Female) Proportion of males and females in each quartile band: Lower Quartile 52% Male 48% Female Lower Middle Quartile 37% Male 63% Female Upper Middle Quartile 42% Male 58% Female Upper Quartile 61% Male 39% Female Short Breaks Family Midweek Weekends One Night Breaks & Star Acts Speciality Breaks Groups & Clubs Bowls Breaks Themed Breaks Drinks Inclusive Information How To Find Us Get A Free Brochure Careers Get in Touch Resort Accommodation Food & Drink Entertainment Facilities And Activities Join us on the following channels Subscribe to our latest news and offers Helpful Information Terms & Conditions Cancellation Protection Website, Cookies & Privacy Policies © 2018 Potters Resort | Quality Time Together | Coast Road, Hopton-on-Sea, NR31 9BX
