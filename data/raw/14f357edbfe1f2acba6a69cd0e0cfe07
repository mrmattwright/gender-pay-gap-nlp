The plan was adopted in 2016 and will be reviewed annually.  In it the Authority outlines how it will promote equality and diversity for the next four years, some of the practical steps we will be taking to put our commitments into practice, the importance of data and how we will monitor our performance and the effectiveness of this Strategic Plan.  The plan sets out seven objectives for improvement. These are the seven things that the Council will focus on improving between 2016 and 2020.         Papers used to inform the Strategic Equality Plan 16-20     A range of papers and evidence were carefully considered when deciding upon the key objectives.

This toolkit will facilitate improved decision making, based on evidence, which considers the wider implications for the service, the council and communities of Powys. It will demonstrate that the council has shown due regard for the corporate, legislative and regulatory requirements placed upon it.

Mandatory Gender pay gap report 2017 The council believes in creating a diverse and gender balanced workforce which reflects the residents and communities we serve.  We have a mean gender pay gap of 10.72% (average) and a median (middle) gender pay gap of 10.22 %.  We believe in job opportunities for everybody regardless of gender, and will challenge ourselves to be more inclusive as a public organisation. We want to create a truly inclusive culture and will be honest about the issues we and others face in our day to day work.  We are committed to a rigorous assessment and competency-based approach that ensures all appointments and internal promotions are made solely on the basis of merit, and are demonstrated against objective and non-discriminatory criteria.  There is still much work to do and our report highlights the degree of challenge that we face, however the council is fully committed to closing the gender pay gap.
