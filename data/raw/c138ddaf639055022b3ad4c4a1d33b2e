Treating our employees well and providing development opportunities is essential to the longevity of our business. That’s why we believe in listening to our employees’ views, equipping them with the skills and knowledge they need to perform and making sure everyone has the opportunity to progress. We want our employees to be proud to work for Allianz, which makes them great ‘brand ambassadors’ when serving our customers.  As a global company, our employees sometimes get amazing opportunities and in 2016, there was a global competition offering the chance to win a once-in-a-lifetime experience to become an Allianz Paralympic Ambassador and to carry the Paralympic flame towards the Opening Ceremony of the Paralympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.       Employee Engagement  Talent  Diversity  Wellbeing  Performance  Rio 2016           Employee engagement  At Allianz, engagement is important because we understand that a strong leadership culture leads to engaged employees, contributing to better business performance.  Engagement is measured through the annual Group-wide Allianz Engagement Survey (AES). The survey is now standard practice in gathering employees' feedback on promoting a high-performance culture within Allianz. The survey content is aligned to the Group’s strategy and local objectives, and is an indicator for good leadership, operational performance and employee advocacy.  Most importantly, the results prompt a leadership debate and result in tangible follow-up actions every year.            Developing talent  Providing personal development and career fulfilment for all employees is a top priority for us. We ensure that our employees are equipped with the skills and knowledge to carry out their role and to take on new responsibilities in the future. Employees can choose from a wide range of opportunities that will meet their personal development needs. We have also made a commitment that all employees are allowed 3 days per year for personal development, which is linked to their development plans.  Developing our talent on all levels in the organisation is a very important success factor for our business in Allianz, both locally and globally. Our internal talent programmes help to move people up through the business using performance management, succession planning and leadership development. Our external recruitment activities help us find the best people for critical roles through search agencies and market mapping.              Diversity and equality  We recognise the importance of having a diverse, inclusive workforce that is made up of employees from different backgrounds.  Diversity and inclusiveness goes beyond equality of opportunity covered by employment legislation. It focuses on each of us recognising our differences and those of others and respecting those differences.  Practising diversity and inclusiveness is a key competitive factor and will ensure that we have the best people in the right job based on merit, aptitude and ability regardless of their background or personal circumstances. Achieving our mission and business goals will require a good mix of people throughout the business to drive innovation, introduce new practices and processes and provide a service that wins customers through outstanding service.  We also want to better understand our diverse customer base and make provisions that they can access our products and services or find specially tailored solutions for their needs.  To support equality we must have fair pay. We’re confident men and women are paid equally for doing the same job at Allianz UK. However, we have fewer women in senior roles, which creates a gender pay gap. Equal pay and gender pay gap both deal with the levels of pay females get at work and are both very important, but they are two different measures.  Gender Pay Gap Report 2017             Health and wellbeing  We recognise and appreciate the value of promoting the health and wellbeing of our employees here at Allianz. As well as caring for our employees’ physical safety at work, we seek to ensure they have access to healthy living and eating options, as well as a range of activities to promote physical and mental wellbeing.  Allianz’s employee wellbeing programme aims to ensure our employees can lead healthy lifestyles at work. Not only do we ensure new starters are taught about our wellbeing programme as part of their induction, each quarter, we develop a different theme to focus on, such as supporting healthier lifestyles and enhancing resilience for high performance.  We use these themes to raise employees’ awareness of the subtle issues of managing their personal health and performance, and highlight the tools we have available to support our employees.

One of our UK employees, David Rogers, won, alongside colleagues from Allianz Ireland and Brazil. Here is his story.  I was in Rio for four days and three nights. We managed to pack an amazing amount into that short stay. We had amazing views from our trip up Sugar Loaf Mountain and to see Christ the Redeemer and were also lucky enough to attend the Opening Ceremony. We were well guided throughout, however what was clear, was the huge contrast between the poor and the more affluent areas.  Regardless though, they all certainly know how to throw a party. Brazilians come across as extremely patriotic, fun loving and welcoming. Their culture is very diverse and they have four clearly defined ethnic types, which lend themselves to different types of music, dance and food. Football, religion, music and enormous steaks seem to be at the top of most Brazilians’ favourite list!  My best moment was getting out on the streets and running the torch relay. It was great to see a local community away from the more touristy parts of the city. When out on the relay I was amazed at how “into it” and genuinely excited the Brazilian people were as the cavalcade worked its way the streets. The run itself was a real high, the more you waved the louder they cheered, very exhilarating.
