As a progressive organisation we are committed to promoting a fair and inclusive workplace. Our 2017 gender pay gap report has been formatted to meet the requirements of the gender pay gap legislation introduced in April 2017, which applies to organisations with more than 250 employees. Ascenti’s pay gap of 7.5% is considerably lower than the 2016 UK average pay gap of 18.1%, which is positive. As part of this report we have also explored variations, which has given us additional confidence that our male and female employees are being paid and treated fairly and equally.
