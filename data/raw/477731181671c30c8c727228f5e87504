"Being able to work as part of a strong team, and care for such lovely people, makes my day."  See below for some of our team member's case studies and read about their progression within Nellsar.                      Why work for us?  "Experience has taught us that promoting internally creates huge benefits across the board – at Nellsar we call it 'Growing our own'!" Gillian Dixon, Operations Manager Residential Services   Our aim is to provide the highest level of care possible – by enabling our staff to be the best they can be. Internal promotion is one of the biggest indicators within a company that staff are valued and that the company is prepared to invest and develop them. Fewer changes in the staff team equals continuity of care – a major factor in keeping our residents safe, happy and contented.  From the outset, Nellsar employees receive a thorough induction in addition to a personalised training program. For many Nellsar staff this is just the beginning of the journey!

I am the deputy manager at The Old Downs. I started with Nellsar in February 2006, as a Bank Staff for cleaning and other domestic jobs. At the time, I didn't really know what I wanted to do – I just needed an opportunity.  I stayed in this role for seven months then my Manager (Gillian Dixon – currently Operations Manager of Residential Services) asked me if I want to be a Care Assistant as she had noticed my interaction with the residents. When I showed the interest to become a Care Assistant, she offered me all kinds of training and supported me in my new role. In August 2009 , she promoted me to a Senior Carer after being a relief Senior for a year. Now that I managed people, I could see how important it was that I was well trained and because I worked in other roles within the Home , I could understand the issues they sometimes faced.  In February 2013, I was promoted to Deputy Manager. Throughout my years with Nellsar, my Manager has always been right behind me, to guide and support me. Now I'm doing my Level 5 training, the next step will be hopefully to become a Manager.   View and download the Nellsar Gender Pay Gap Statement here.
