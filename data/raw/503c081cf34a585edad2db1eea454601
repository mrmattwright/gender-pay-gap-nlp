Our diversity strategy includes fair and equal employment and career development practices. It means acceptance, respect and understanding – for both co-workers and stakeholders. Diversity is one of the eight pillars forming the core of our human resources policy. We promote it with all employees through presentations and videos on our intranet, during information and discussion days, and via a range of communication campaigns. Our Code of Ethics includes a clear statement on equal employment opportunities, in line with UN Global Compact principles to which we adhered in 2009: "Gemalto offers equal employment opportunities. We do not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination, including that based on ethnicity, skin color, national origin, gender, age, religion, and sexual orientation, or physical and mental disabilities." Our diversity activities are divided into three main areas:  Cultural diversity  Gender equality and women's empowerment  Disability integration Cultural diversity With offices in 48 countries serving customers in 180 countries, cultural diversity has long been key to Gemalto's expansion into new markets. Our employees are made up of 119 nationalities, forming an open and diverse workforce. We believe this is a key asset that we need to continually protect, enrich, and optimize: We encourage the creation of multicultural teams to reinforce our potential for innovation by sharing ideas, best practices and by boosting creativity. Employees are given the opportunity to improve their cultural awareness. They get to meet as many people as possible, through training, short or long missions, symposiums, joint projects, etc. We also encourage international mobility, offering employees the opportunity to work in different entities worldwide. Mobility is the best way to keep people growing and learning and to prepare them for future challenges in which agility of mind is key.  ​​ Testimonials Corporate communication: A very diverse team!   ​​​"Our 19-strong team, mainly based in France and the US, comprises six nationalities: French, Canadian, British, Polish, American, and Greek. Gemalto is an international company, and as such, it is crucial to have a multicultural team as it helps us to share different views and cultures. Six people in the team work outside their country of origin, which illustrates the mobility and adaptability of our people. In general, expatriates are open to other cultures and they care about speaking the same language as our different "audiences" worldwide, including employees, customers, investors and partners. We do not, of course, represent all of their cultures, which is why we work very closely with a communication champion's network representing the 48 countries in which we operate. " Isabelle Marand , Corporate Communications Director​ Geographical Mobility within Gemalto: Sanjeet Purohit   ​Sanjeet Purohit is VP HR (Human Resources) – Enterprise & Cybersecurity at Gemalto. His family is from the eastern part of​ India, but he was born and brought up in Delhi. "I've worked in various industries from services to healthcare, and even in entertainment with a spell in Bollywood. Now, I'm firmly invested in technology, having worked for Gemalto for 12 years on five continents, and across a wide range of cultures." "From a personal standpoint, Gemalto's approach to diversity has made me extremely open to change, very flexible, keen to engage with local cultural dynamics, and able to recognize excellence in every culture, person, and location. This has helped me build my leadership skills and enabled me to resolve complex issues involving international HR dynamics. I now have a clear sense of worldwide strategy whenever I am building a plan, project or policy, and I am a more efficient and effective business partner, able to implement best practices and remove performance barriers for our people worldwide. " "Gemalto is an international company and diversity is key to building an international culture. From an HR standpoint, it is imperative to have a consistent environment of teamwork across all locations and businesses, and that is driven by people with diverse skills and cultures. Diversity brings balance, and that is the foundation of a strong and stable organization. I am convinced that a diverse human capital is the future in an ever evolving and transforming organization." Gender equality and women's empowerment Gemalto is an engineering-based company in an industry that has historically tended to attract more men than women. Today, women make up 38% of all Gemalto employees and 29% of our exempt employee population. To create more balance, we work closely with Human Resources teams to focus on attracting more women and supporting their development and promotion into all levels of expert and management positions. Encouraging more women to join Gemalto We have set up various strategies to bring more women into our company. For example, we set specific targets for recruitment, our women engineers participate in recruitment forums as role models and we communicate externally on our gender diversity programs. As a result, in 2016, women accounted for 32% of our new exempt recruits – which is fairly high in the tech industry. More widely speaking, we are committed to raising awareness among young women about engineering careers, a sector in which they are traditionally under-represented, but one which is very promising in terms of employment. We are partners with the French association "Elles Bougent", whose main aim is to encourage gender balance in companies in the industrial and tech industries. We are also helping disadvantaged young women to study engineering in China, Mexico and India, through the provision of study grants. Promoting women at Gemalto Gemalto Connected Women is our internal professional network. It was launched in January 2015 by women employees with the backing of Gemalto's top management. It aims to promote gender diversity by building awareness, taking concrete actions and sharing best practice among Gemalto women. The network keeps growing and today numbers more than 1,000 members across 23 chapters around the world, an increase of 40% compared to 2015. In 2016, we also launched an internal Gemalto Connected Women mentoring program, which now includes over 100 mentor-mentee partnerships in eight cities across the globe We also ensure equity in the developing and mentoring programs of our managers: In 2016, 36% of participants in Gemalto University Leadership development programs were women. A step forward In March 2017 our CEO Philippe Vallée signed the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEP) CEO Statement. WEP is part of the United Nations' Global Compact initiative for sustainability in business, to which Gemalto has been committed since 2010. With the subheading: "Equality Means Business", the seven WEP principles provide guidance to companies for promoting gender equality and women's empowerment. Since then, we have conducted a gap analysis of the seven principles and are defining actions to improve our practices. Testimonials Two Gemalto women managers in senior positions share their views on gender diversity. Christine Caviglioli: SVP Automotive and Mobility services, based in la Ciotat (France)   Christine Caviglioli has enjoyed a long career in telecoms and IoT, typically men-dominated fields. "It's hard, being a woman in a men-dominated world. You need to fight, and you're constantly having to prove yourself. You need to believe in yourself, develop a thick skin, and not hold back." "Gemalto operates in a traditionally men-dominated industry, but for some years now has been seeking to hire more women in senior positions because there are still too few of us, particularly in the business organization. Diversity brings greater perspectives for the company through a mix of skills and personalities, and it's a real driver for innovation, competitiveness, improvement and economic growth, and all of that brings better results for the company. To ensure diversity, we need to eliminate stereotypes. This would ensure a more open world view which would have wonderful consequences in terms of creativity within the company." "At Gemalto, we are actively fighting back against sexism with our women's network and specific training programs, encouraging the recruitment and promotion of women." Diane Pewitt, Global Operations, Enterprise & Cybersecurity Safenet based in Austin (USA)   Most of Diane Pewitt's career has been spent in manufacturing and operations with different companies in the USA. "Unless they're in education or healthcare, I guess most women have spent their careers in a men-dominated world – I certainly have! But I think my athletics background has helped with that – playing basketball at college level meant that in order to sharpen my skills, I wanted to play with those taller and stronger than me, thus I spent most of my time playing against men and that certainly gave me a lot of experience in holding my own. "For me, diversity is essential in a company in order to help avoid 'group-think'. It's about ensuring regular injections of fresh ideas and perspectives, wherever they come from. "The tide is turning now, and I'm hopeful that women, with their encompassing compassion, empathy and more inclusive approach to negotiation will finally find and equal footing. They tend to be holistic problem solvers, and they are relationship and network builders – and this is all hugely valuable in leadership roles." Disability integration To be consistent with our ethical values prohibiting any kind of discrimination, Gemalto is actively raising awareness on disability discrimination issues. For the moment, this is mainly focused in France, with the signature of a second three-year agreement covering the period from 2016-2018 to encourage the employment of people with disabilities. This strategy focuses on four main areas: Improving how our employees perceive disabled people and combatting stereotypes by offering training, communication, and special events. Training and supporting those who play a key role in terms of recruitment and career development for disabled employees, such as HR teams, occupational health services, and managers. Facilitating the integration of disabled employees and ensuring equality in terms of their career prospects. Working with subcontractors who specialize in employing people with disabilities. By the end of the first agreement covering the period 2013-2015, we had almost doubled the employment rate of people with disabilities at our Gemalto France locations from 2.50% to 4.73%. In 2016 the rate has increased to 5.23%. On an international level, Gemalto takes special care to comply with all legal requirements, regulations, and local initiatives to ensure and promote disability equality. Partnerships and voluntary programs We have also developed specific partnerships worldwide that encourage equal employment opportunities for the disabled: Gemalto is a co-founder and active member of the HUGo program, a voluntary initiative created by a group of local businesses along with the Polytech Marseille. It aims to teach disabled people IT skills to improve their employment prospects and facilitate their professional integration. Every year, Gemalto supports and organizes voluntary programs for employees. For instance in 2017: Over 70 Gemalto volunteers in Mexico gave their time and energy to build wheelchairs for disabled people 19 employees from Singapore participated in an event to forge new friendships between the hearing and hearing-impaired community, to raise awareness and break the psychological barrier of communicating with the deaf.​ Related Documents  UK gender pay gap report ​                         Your browser does not support iframes.
