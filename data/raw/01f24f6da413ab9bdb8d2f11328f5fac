Stephen Baxter  - Chief Executive Officer              JLA Principles       Our commitment to preventing modern slavery  Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It can take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery.   IT IS JLA’S COMMITMENT AND PROMISE TO:   Act ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships;  Implement and enforce effective and proportionate systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains;  Encourage and influence our suppliers to prohibit the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, whether adults or children;  Work collaboratively and in partnership with our business partners and suppliers to ensure transparent business relationships;  Encourage openness and honesty and the reporting of known or suspected modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chain at the earliest possible stage;  Communicate these principles to all suppliers, contractors and business partners at the outset of our business relationship.   You can read more about our commitment on our dedicated Modern Slavery page.              JLA's Safeguarding Policy       For JLA's Safeguarding Policy, click here .
