BROOKSON LTD 
GENDER PAY GAP 
REPORT 2017

1.INTRODUCTION

The Brookson ethos is that there is always a better way – and we wholeheartedly follow this ethos in all aspects of our business activities. We are 
committed to creating a diverse and inclusive organisation where all our capable people can succeed irrespective of their background or gender. Our 
overall aim is to build teams at all levels which are fully representative of the local communities in which our offices are situated.
 
This year, the UK Government is requiring all employers with 250 or more employees in England, Scotland and Wales to publish their gender pay gap 
as of 5th April 2017. This requirement involves a representation of gender pay gap by three particular measures – hourly rate, pay quartiles and 
bonus pay level and proportion of women and men receiving it.

It is worth being clear at this point that these gender pay gap measures are not a representation of equal pay – we are wholly committed to equal pay 
and we are confident that across our business women and men are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs.  

2.MEASURES

PAY QUARTILES MEASURE

Lower

Upper Middle

Upper Quartile

The Brookson business employs more women than men in relation to three of the four quartiles 
but the predominance of men in the top quartile is significant. It is these roles where the 
market rate of pay is higher and the higher bonus levels are paid, although such bonuses are 
paid less often. At the lower quartiles, the market rate of pay is lower and the bonus levels are 
lower, although bonuses are paid much more regularly. The top quartile predominance of men 
is therefore distortive in the pay and bonus calculations and it is primarily this organisational 
structure which explains the gender pay and bonus gaps identified in the following measures.

EMPLOYS MORE 
WOMEN THAN MEN 
IN RELATION TO 
THREE OF THE FOUR 
QUARTILES

HOURLY RATE MEASURES

The average gender pay gap for the Financial Services industry 
is estimated at 34% (PwC Women at Work Index in 2017).

The Brookson measures show that the mean and median pay 
levels for women who work at Brookson are 33.87% and 32.55% 
lower than those of the men who work for the business. This pay 
gap is driven by the predominance of men in the top quartile of 
earners in the business.

BONUS PAY
BONUS PAY GAP

Median43%
Lower

Mean

Lower

88% of men received a bonus and 100% of women did. The gender gap in 
bonus pay above is driven by two key factors – the first and most significant 
is the proportion of men in the top pay quartile and the second is the level of 
part time working by women that the business supports. 

82% of the top paying roles in the business are held by men and these roles 
typically earn the highest bonuses subject to the financial performance that 
they deliver. The period covered by this report included a high bonus payment 
level to these individuals, which contrasts with the current period where the 
highest paid employees have not received a bonus compared with the lower 
three quartiles which all received bonus payments.  

The second key impact here is the level of part time working in women in 
Brookson which is 10.45% of our overall population, compared to 0% in men. 
This mix of working impacts the bonus rates for women in the business 
based on the required calculation basis. If we adjust for the part time working 
men, the adjusted bonus rate measures are as follows:

3.OUR TARGET

We are committed to increasing the proportion of women in our top quartile roles and this will ensure that the gender pay and bonus gaps highlighted above will 
reduce significantly over time. We recognise that this level of diversity is a must for the business.

We carried out a review on the diversity mix in the Warrington Borough Council and compared this to the diversity mix of our workforce. This provided a valuable 
insight into how our workforce compared to the local area and over the years we have actively worked to address any gaps regarding gender, ethnicity and 
disability. We now have a 50/50 male-female workforce and exceed the local diversity mix in relation to ethnicity and disability. 

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES

  Board commitment that Gender Pay Gap is a fixed agenda item at Board meetings
  A recruitment process which requires senior management and director shortlists to be diverse
  Carry out quarterly salary and benefits survey to ensure we are paying in line with or above market rate
  Carry out internal role salary reviews to ensure salaries are comparable based on experience                                 

and qualifications and harmonise accordingly

  A real focus on the talented and capable women in our organisation in our learning and development             

and succession planning activities

  Increased availability of flexible working opportunities in all our roles, especially the senior ones
