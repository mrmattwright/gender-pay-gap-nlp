We believe this is critical for the success of our company, to protect our brand and to advance better social and environmental conditions in global supply chains.  Our responsibility framework ‘It’s about caring’ unites our five priority areas: People, Products, Planet, Partnerships and Policies.                            People   The success of Flying Tiger Copenhagen is fully dependent on the people in the stores who passionately sell our products around the world. We are dedicated to offering our employees in the stores, warehouses and headquarters a great, diverse and engaging workplace, with safe and fair working conditions and equal opportunities for all.   Human rights We recognize our corporate responsibility to respect human rights in all our operations and we work towards integrating human rights due diligence into our daily work in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.   Our commitment applies throughout our value chain. At the same time, we recognize that some stakeholder groups are more affected by our activities than others. To ensure that we focus our efforts on those areas where we have the greatest impact, we have defined four priority areas:  Customers: Safe products.  Employees: Treating our employees with respect and dignity.  Business relations: Responsible sourcing of products.  Local communities: Being a positive force where we operate. Download our Human Rights Policy here      Diversity  Zebra aims to offer equal opportunities to men and women across its organisation, and it is company policy to promote equal opportunities regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religion and sexual orientation.  When it comes to gender, Zebra aims at a balanced distribution among employees in leadership positions. Zebra’s management is currently composed of 54% male and 46% female members. Zebra defines management as district leaders, country managers, partners as well as managers at headquarter.  Relevant professional qualifications remain the key selection criteria for all positions in the Zebra organisation, but Zebra’s management will continue to focus on diversity and will continue to evaluate the need for initiatives within this area.  At the end of 2016, the Board of Directors of Zebra was composed of 100% male members (unchanged compared to 2015). It is the Board’s ambition to increase diversity, including gender representation.  The target horizon is expanded with four years as it is the current assessment that the Board has the required qualifications and composition in order to oversee Zebra’s strategic development. The target will be sought achieved in connection with ongoing changes to the composition of the Board, where special efforts will be made to ensure that female candidates are identified and participate in the selection process.    In the UK, the Gender Pay Gap legislation, under the Equality Act 2010, requires an employer with 250 employees or more to publish their gender pay gap for their employees.

We want to offer our customers useful, fun, and fresh products at affordable prices. And we want our products to be safe and produced under humane and responsible conditions in respect of international social, environmental and ethical standards. We do not produce the products ourselves, but purchase them from more than 600 suppliers worldwide. Most of our direct suppliers are trading companies who source from a range of different factories, enabling us to offer a broad array of novel products across a variety of categories. We work closely with our suppliers to build their capabilities on quality, product and social compliance enabling them and the factories they use to meet our requirements.         Product safety  Across all our product categories, product safety is key for us. We want our customers to have safe experiences using our products. We continuously work to optimize our safety process to ensure that our products meet or exceed safety and quality legislation and regulations in the EU and other relevant markets.        Our Product Safety Policy expresses our commitment to safe products. Download our Product Safety Policy here.  To meet our commitment, we have designed a compliance process, which all products go through. It comprises three phases:  Phase One: From idea to product approval: Product samples are assessed according to their function and quality to determine risk and the required safety measures. We approve all the materials used in our products through our Bill of Materials process prior to the production. High risk products are subject to third-party testing for any unwanted materials that might compromise the safety of the products. This includes toys, electronics and food contact products. As a minimum, we always comply with EU requirements or the applicable national legislation, whichever sets the highest standards.   Phase Two: Production and factory inspection:  When in production, our quality inspection teams conduct quality inspections at the factories to ensure that the products do not carry any defects. We take a risk-based approach, which means paying particular attention to products considered to be high-risk. We do not place any product in our stores without knowing the results of our tests and having approved the products.   Phase Three: Sale and claims handling: While products are on the market, we continuously monitor their safety and quality. We do this by conducting our own sample tests, collecting feedback from our customers and engaging with authorities. Any product claims we might receive are carefully analysed and the results are fed into future product designs.   Recalls:  We are committed to selling only safe products. Consequently, we have a goal of zero product recalls. In 2016, up to 20,000 different products were available throughout our stores and we had to recall three products. We will continuously work to refine our process to further bring down this figure.                      Responsible sourcing  We believe responsible practices in sourcing our products are critical for the success of our company. Even though we don’t own the factories that produce our products ourselves, we have a responsibility towards the workers producing our products. To ensure that they are treated with respect and provided fair working conditions, we have established a social compliance process that follows 3 steps.                Social compliance process:  1. All suppliers must sign the Zebra Supplier Code of Conduct. The Code is based on international standards as defined by the United Nations (UN) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It defines our requirements and expectations in the areas of workplace health and safety, terms of employment, working hours, wages, environmental protection and business ethics. Among other it prohibits child labour, forced labour, dangerous or severely unhealthy working conditions and abusive disciplinary practices. No purchases can be made without the supplier committing to the standards of the Code of Conduct in writing. The Supplier Code of Conduct is supported by additional policies on animal welfare, child labour and young workers and home-workers. Download our Supplier of Code of Conduct Policy here   2 . Factories are selected for audit based on a systematic product risk assessment, enabling us to focus on factories with greatest potential for positive change. On-site audits are carried out by our Chinese auditor team or by an independent third-party organisation. All audits comprise a visual inspection of the site; document reviews; and interviews with workers and management.   3. If the audit reveals non-compliances, factories must implement a corrective action plan (CAP) within a defined timeline. Audit follow-up takes place via close engagement with our suppliers, who must present progress reports and valid evidence to Zebra in a timely manner. The audit follow-up may also include e-learning and/or on-site training. Factories that are not improving as agreed are put on hold and must go through a stringent requalification process before potentially supplying to Zebra again. In case a supplier and/or factory is unwilling to improve, we will stop the collaboration permanently.                   Training and capability building  Our product and social compliance processes are critical tools to ensure compliance in our supply chain. To drive continuous and genuine improvements, we combine these processes with capability-building and training of our suppliers and their factories. Our training includes guidance to traders on how to build management systems to monitor and promote social compliance among their factories as well as practical instructions to factories on how to meet our requirements.                       Partnerships    Charity donations As a global company, we want and can do good for the communities where we operate. This includes collaborating with a range of organisation to support people in need. At corporate level, we have partnered with among other the Red Cross in Denmark, the UK and Spain and In-kind Donation in the UK. We donate a wide range of products to the organisations who then distribute further to people in need.  In addition to activities at the global level, our local companies who operate the stores at country-level are active in supporting local community projects and charity work.   Combating food waste We want to contribute to the fight against food waste and at the same time give back to people in need. We collaborate with foodbanks in UK, Denmark and Spain where we have our European warehouses. This means that all our food products are offered to food banks when the expiry date approaches.                       Planet     Our planet is facing environmental challenges, which require actions from all members of society. Our Environmental Policy expresses our commitment to protect the environment and the climate by minimising our negative impact. Download our Environmental Policy here  A significant part of our impact derives from production in our supply chain. Consequently, our Supplier Code of Conduct, further specifies our requirements to the environmental awareness and conduct of our suppliers. Download our Supplier Code of Conduct Policy here  Apart from seeking to minimise impact in the supply chain, we focus our resources where Zebra, as a retailer, has the highest impact. This includes reducing energy consumption in stores and offices, sourcing sustainable forestry products and minimising food- and other product waste via donations.    Sustainable forestry products (FSC)  In 2017, Zebra became FSC certified. With the certification and our membership of the FSC, we support the promotion of forests managed with consideration for people, wildlife and the environment. Among other, FSC certification entails protection of biodiversity and the people working in the forest: including that workers are properly trained, have decent health and safety conditions, and receive fair wages.  Our portfolio of FSC certified products include many of our paper products, such as notebooks, gift paper, napkins, paper cups etc. however, not all carry the FSC logo yet. In 2018 customers will increasingly be able to identify the products, as new labelling with the FSC logo is being implemented.                        Our stores   Sustainable store inventory Since 2012 have we promoted use of sustainable wood in our store inventory. End 2016, more than 95% of our stores have furniture made of FSC certified wood.   Energy consumption To minimise the environmental footprint of our stores we began replacing traditional bulbs with LED bulbs back in 2013. Today we require that all new and refurbished stores install LED lighting. End 2016, more than 50% of our stores use LED bulbs.                       CSR Policies   Consistency and transparency is a key pillar in any responsibility work. We use our responsibility policy framework to clarify our positions, guide our decision-making and define expectations to our business partners. The framework comprises policies on business ethics, human rights, product safety and the environment. Within responsible sourcing, our Supplier Code of Conduct is the leading document, it has been complemented by policies on animal welfare; child labour and young workers; and home-workers. In 2017, we published our first transparency statement according to the UK Modern Slavery Act.  Business Ethics  Our Business Ethics Code of Conduct outlines the ethical expectations to our employees. The Code is a binding part of employment contracts and signed by: all employees at Zebra A/S, all partners and subsidiaries including their Headquarter staff, district and store managers. All our partners and all employees in leadership positions at Zebra A/S have received face to face business ethics training.
