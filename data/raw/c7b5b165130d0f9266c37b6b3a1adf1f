Our framework covers all grades and, like many other hospitality and retail businesses, we pay at least the national minimum wage for roles.  Our grading structure represents the way we do business – it’s straightforward and considers what is right for us.  Our gender pay gap is a reflection of all of this and of where we are in our journey.    Gender Pay and Bonus Gap       MEAN  MEDIAN    Difference between men and women   Average  Middle    Gender pay gap   14.3%  3.8%    Gender bonus gap   93.0%  60.3%            At Daniel Thwaites our gender pay gap is 3.8% (median) – significantly lower than the current national average of 18.1% (median).  The gender gap in our bonus pay reflects what we see in our business – we have a higher proportion of males in our top pay quartile that are eligible for a bonus payment.  The gender bonus pay gap was further amplified in 2016 by some exceptional long term bonus payments, paid at a time when we had no female representation in our Executive Team.    Pay Quartiles     Median Gender Pay Gap By Quartile   Men  Women    Top quartile   54.6%  45.4%    Uper middle quartile   40.4%  59.6%    Middle quartile   32.7%  67.3%    Lower quartile   43.6%  56.4%       How we are tackling our gender pay gap     Keep doing the right things   We know that if we stick to being fair and equitable with all our employees we will continue to drive down the gender pay gap. We need to maintain our effort on developing more female managers who are eligible for bonus pay.     A diversified, gender balanced senior team   We have diversified the composition of the senior team to include a balance of both male and female members and will seek to maintain this balance where it is possible to do so.     Challenge ourselves to think differently   We have different areas in our business that historically attract a higher proportion of females or males and we need to address this more pro-actively.  We will focus on creating the right culture to encourage females to apply for senior management roles by:     Reviewing our recruitment and selection processes to understand why we are not attractive to female senior leaders, and then action those points.  Pro-actively striving for a 70% internal promotion rate for managers.  Having a more balanced male to female ratio on our internal management development programmes which will then feed into the metric for internal promotions.
