This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website.  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace  the balance of male and female employees at different levels  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.   The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.  Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender established by using our existing HR and payroll records.
