gender pay gap in 2018 for the first time.  At Greenhalgh’s Craft Bakery we are committed to treating
our employees equally and ensuring that everyone – no matter what their
background, race, ethnicity or gender – has an opportunity to develop. We are
certain that any gender pay gap is not caused by men and women being paid
differently to do the same job, but is driven by the structure of our workforce.   Gender Pay &
Bonus Pay Gap  As of the snapshot date (5 April 2017) the table below shows
the overall mean and median gender pay gap and bonus pay gap based on hourly
rates of pay. The percentage shown is the difference in the overall mean and
median pay and bonus between men and woman.  Difference between
men and women   Mean (Average)  Median (Mid-Range)  Hourly Pay Gap 13.55% 3.23%  Bonus Pay Gap -28.59% -50%  From the reports we have already seen submitted by other
companies within our business sector, we can see that our gender pay gap
already significantly lower.  Proportion of males
and females receiving a bonus payment  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment 1.03%  Proportion of females receiving a bonus payment 0.18%  Proportion of males
and females in each pay quartile  We have divided the workforce in four equal size pay
quartile bands. The table below shows the proportion of males and females
within each quartile band expressed as a percentage.  Proportion of male employees in
upper quartile band 48.58%  Proportion of female employees in
upper quartile band 51.42%  Proportion of male employees in
upper middle quartile band 34.43%  Proportion of female employees in
upper middle quartile band 65.57%  Proportion of male employees in
lower middle quartile band 29.25%  Proportion of female employees in
lower middle quartile band 70.75%  Proportion of male employees in
lower quartile band 25.47%  Proportion of female employees in
lower quartile band 74.53%  In common with many other businesses, particularly those in
our sector, we employ many more females than males in front line retail
operations. This includes a number of young employees under the age of 20
working on a part time basis. This is not the case in the top pay quartile
where the proportions of male and female employees are much closer.  I can confirm that the data contained within this report is
