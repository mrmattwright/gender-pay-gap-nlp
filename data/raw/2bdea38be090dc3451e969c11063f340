I have never been academic, but the way Sutton Valence assists their students to work to their best ability has meant I am incredibly proud of the results I have achieved.”  Teddy Turpin, ex-pupil    “It has made me more organised, and has allowed me to establish a good balance between work and sport. The school has inspired me to succeed and has motivated me to try my hardest in whatever I do”  Patrick Backhouse, ex-pupil    “The sense of community makes it feel as though you are part of a safe but exciting family. Nowhere looks out for you like Sutton Valence School does”  Beth Webb, ex-pupil        Most recent photos                                                    Contact Us  United Westminster Schools & The Grey Coat Hospital Foundation 57 Palace Street London SW1E 5HJ Tel: 020 7828 3055     Key information   Contact us  Role and responsibilities of trustees  Special events      Latest News           Gender Pay Gap Report at April 2017    March 23, 2018             BrainCanDo – Conference 15th March 2018    February 6, 2018         Schools Westminster City School  Emanuel School  Sutton Valence School  The Grey Coat Hospital  Queen Anne’s School        © Copyright Westminster Grey Coat 2017
