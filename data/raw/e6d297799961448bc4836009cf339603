Today DEXEU is publishing the first gender pay gap report based on staff on our payroll as at 31 March 2017. Although the department had less than 250 staff on payroll on that date, we are publishing this report as part of an initiative to improve transparency across the Civil Service.  The report lays out an in-depth analysis of the department’s gender pay gap and offers a number of actions to improve it.
