Julius Rutherfoord & Co Ltd supplies Secure Commercial Cleaning to buildings used both by the public sector, (eg Courts, Schools, Universities, and Museums) and the private sector, (mainly offices or large commercial property developments).  Our major challenge is that 90% of the cleaning shifts undertaken by our employees are 2 to 3 hours in length and are undertaken either early in the morning or early in the evening.  We do not have control over the times or the lengths of the cleaning shifts, as these are dictated by our clients to ensure maximum efficiency around how they, their employees and their clients/pupils use the spaces that we clean.  The high percentage of women working in the lower quartile can be explained by the fact that the part time nature of the work would appear to suit their personal decisions of not working full time so being able to fit in their other requirements.  We are proud to point out that in the Upper Quartile of earnings we have an exact 50:50 split between males and females showing the success of our long term commitment to equal opportunity in recruitment, training, promotion and remuneration.  2017 to 2018 Gender Pay Gap Data     Difference in mean hourly rate of pay  8.4%      Difference in median hourly rate of pay  7.4%      Difference in mean bonus pay  -32.7%      Difference in median bonus pay  -3.6%      Percentage of employees who received bonus pay  Male 6%  Female 2%     Employees by pay quartile  Upper quartile  Upper middle quartile  Lower middle quartile  Lower quartile    Male  50%  40%  34%  34%    Female  50%  60%  66%  66%                                                        Home  About  Case Studies  Services  News  Portals  Contact  Sharepoint  Gender Pay Statement  Modern Slavery Policy     Terms & Conditions  Cookie Policy  Privacy Policy  Sitemap  Sitemap XML  Blog RSS   © Copyright 2018 Julius Rutherfoord.
