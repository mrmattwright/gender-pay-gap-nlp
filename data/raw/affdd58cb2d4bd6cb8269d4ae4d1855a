Our Equality and Diversity Policy takes into account all current UK and EU legislation and guidelines issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission on compliance with the Equality Act 2010. We aim to be an inclusive organisation, ensuring that patients, job applicants, employees, contractors, agency staff and visitors will not be disadvantaged by conditions or requirements which cannot be justified, particularly on the grounds of ethnic origin, or nationality, disability, gender, gender assignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity status, age, sexual orientation, trade union activity, political or religious beliefs.

Trusts are required, under the NHS standard contract, to implement the Standard by publishing workforce ethnicity data as of 1 April 2015 before the 1 July 2015 and annually thereafter. There are 9 indicators or metrics in the NHS England reporting template, designed to give an overview of the organization. The Trusts WRES Report and Action Plan for 2017 can be

The overall aim of these workshops is to raise awareness of Equality and Diversity and how this impacts on service delivery. The sessions highlight the importance and relevance of Equality and Diversity in today's NHS. These half day workshops are for all staff and are designed to enable the participants to utilise tools to explore and develop their roles. They are able to recognise a variety of Equality and Diversity issues and implement pertinent strategies for effective working practice in line with the Trust's Equality and Diversity action plan. The workshops cover key elements such as responsibilities as a role model, Equality and Diversity responsibilities as a manager and employee in addition to legislation and policy. Equality and Diversity training is also available as an e-learning package which can be completed by staff from any computer in the Trust. Equality and Diversity will form part of common core content for all clinical and non-clinical foundation degrees developed in partnership with local universities and the Trust. Equality and Diversity will continue to be highlighted at corporate induction with signposting to the E-Learning programme and the workshops.
