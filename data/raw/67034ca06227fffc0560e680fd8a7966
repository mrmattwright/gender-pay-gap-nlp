Mr Slough Service rating: Knowledgeable, efficient, pleasant to do business with. Anonymous customer Service rating: They took the time to find us the car we were looking for at the price we wanted to pay. I would recommend them to friends and wuld buy from them again. Mrs Jacobs Service rating: Standard service fine, but no mention of sat nav control dial I asked them to check, also car poorly washed - if they are going to bother to wash the car at least make a good job of it! Mrs Lee Service rating: Simon Mills was amazing!  We would definitely buy again as Simon as our salesman.  Lovely man, and so helpful! Also was fantastic with my daughter! Miss Hicks Service rating: As ever very impressed from start to finish. Well looked after and great service Mr Burrows Service rating: It’s a real pleasure walking in and the attention to detail is amazing many congratulations on your customer care. Mr Player Service rating: Fantastic service from all members of staff from sales to service. Could not fault and lovely coffee while u wAit..thank you team. Anonymous customer Service rating: The whole team at Mercedes Plymouth are very welcoming and accommodating. The whole experience is wonderful! thank you! Mr Taylor Service rating: Service was well carried out (so far as I can judge), quick and efficient. But I was surprised to be telephoned and invited to pay for wheel tracking alignment. While I accept that not every potential fault can be included in a service scheme, I think that checking the tracking should be routine - just like checking tyre and brake pad wear, etc. Mr Carter Service rating: What I expected of a Mercedes Benz retailer. Mr Cunningham Service rating: Better vehicle checks - its on its third trip back to have faults that should have been picked up pre-delivery. (Paintwork, a dent, non-functioning stop start).  More responsive staff - I have had to chase a lot to get any resolution. Anonymous customer Service rating: They did what they said that they were going to do, when they said that they would it, in an extremely courteous and professional manner. However, I doubt very much whether I will ever purchase another Mercedes as ,this attitude did not seem to be reflected in my dealings with Mercedes finance last year, and I also feel that, recently having to purchase a new set of tyres at 7500 miles at a cost of around £800, can I justify the cost of ownership Mr Jones Service rating: Such a smooth transition from my old car to the new one . Lisa and Michael of Mercedes Exeter were such lovely people and a pleasure to do business with . Mr Gregory Service rating: very good service helpful service manager Mathew could not of done any more for us I was having trouble with start stop but they sorted that out and is working fine thank you Exeter Mercedes Mr Doney Service rating: It's a5 stars ,  for the car,  5 stars for all the people that work at Taunton. The car is everything that you could  wish  for, and the staff can't do enough. Anonymous customer Service rating: The service we have received from Mercedes Exeter has always been excellent. We decided to purchase the B class model following the use of a courtesy car.    The Mercedes sales executive was Lorna Humphreys. Lorna is very professional, polite and has an encouraging manner which made our purchase an easy process. Many thanks Lorna. Mr Evans Service rating: Great customer service. Christian Gibbs has done a wonderful job. He deserves bonus :) Sold my husband a C Class and built a good rapport with him, we decided to return and buy an A Class for me.
