But before we get you booked in, here are some things you need to know.   Please note we now take a deposit per person in order to secure your bowling, restaurant & karaoke bookings. During peak times where a restaurant reservation is required your £9.95 (per person) deposit is split evenly between your lanes (£5) & dining reservations (£4.95). On arrival you will be required to set up a tab and your deposit will be redeemed against your final bill.   Please have your credit or debit card details ready. Deposits are required per person for all bowling & karaoke bookings.   Please be aware that by completing your reservation, you are accepting our terms and conditions as detailed below.   MAKING A CANCELLATION   BOWLING & KARAOKE   If you wish to cancel, please contact us more than 48 hours before your arrival time.   If you cancel or change the date of the booking less than 48 hours prior to your reservation, your deposit will not be refunded.   If you are a group of 15+ guests and want to cancel your reservation, you must give 10 days notice otherwise your deposit will not be refunded.   If you do not show up for your bowling/dining and/or karaoke booking your deposit will not be refunded.   We ask all our bowlers to arrive 15 minutes before your lane time, if you are running late then please let us know. We can only hold your lane for 10 minutes. After this time we cannot guarantee your booking, however we will do our best to fit you in if we can and allocate your deposit to a later game. If we have no lanes available we will put your deposit towards your restaurant bill if you dine with us. Deposits are non-refundable.   Reducing the party size within 48 hrs of your booking will forfeit the deposits of each person who is not attending. Please note that for groups of 15+ we require 10 days notice if you wish to reduce the party size.   Increasing the party size prior to arrival requires an additional deposit per additional guest.   Deposits are taken by credit or debit card. Refunds will be put back to the same card that the booking was taken on.   BAR BOOTH PACKAGES   A deposit of £10 per person is required to secure this booking including full payment of pre-orders.
