UK Mail welcomes the opportunity to report our gender pay gap under The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.         We're proud to support women and men equally   At UK Mail, part of DHL, we strongly believe that one of greatest strengths is our people. We pride ourselves on being a business that supports women and men equally in the workplace and will continue to do so as we grow and attract new talent.  Logistics is an industry that has been traditionally male-led. However, things are changing for the better. In the last decade, our female workforce has grown and now represents over 25% of our workforce and we are now on a mission to attract more women into our business.
