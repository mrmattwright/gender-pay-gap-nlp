Every organisation employing 250 or more staff is required to report Gender Pay 
information under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) regulations 2017.  
This must include the following data: 

  Their mean gender pay gap 
  Their median gender pay gap 
  Their mean bonus gender pay gap 
  Their median bonus gender pay gap 
  The proportion of men in the organisation receiving a bonus payment 
  The proportion of women the organisation receiving a bonus payment 

 
These figures are reported using a snapshot date of 5 April 2017 (and every 5 April from 
then on).  One YMCA reported our figures within a week of the snapshot date.  This 
report gives the narrative behind our figures. 
 
 
What it is… and isn’t 
A gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, 
expressed relative to men’s earnings. It looks at median and mean pay and bonuses for 
both men and women.  If indicated, the gender pay gap is a measure of the 
difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women. 
 
Aside from the importance of monitoring the figures to ensure balance, it is an exercise 
in statistics using the prescribed calculation process. There are a number of reasonable 
ways of looking at One YMCA’s pay data which show a median pay gap of 0%. 
 
It is not an equal pay audit - which assesses whether women and men are paid the 
same rate for the same (or comparable) roles.  One YMCA has robust systems in 
place to deal with this. 
 
 
What information is not included in the required calculation? 
Anyone not receiving full pay in the relevant month, including: 

  Anyone on nil pay 
  Anyone on sick pay 
  Anyone on maternity / paternity / shared parental pay 
  Most casual staff 

 
…and of course the headline figures are at the snapshot date of 5 April and are not 
averaged across the year. 
 
 
What is it designed to tell us? 

If there is a gap in average pay between men and women 
In which salary area any gap exists (e.g., in the middle-earning group) 

 
 
…and by extension… 
 

If women in general are in lower paid roles than men, using the prescribed 
calculation basis

The headline figures 
For the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, One YMCA reported the following figures: 

  Women’s mean hourly rate is 14% lower than men’s 

In other words when comparing mean hourly rates, women earn 86p for every £1 
that men earn, using the required calculation basis. 

  Women’s median hourly rate is 16% lower than men’s 

In other words when comparing median hourly rates, women earn 84p for every 
£1 that men earn, using the required calculation basis. 

  We have paid no bonuses, therefore there are no figures to report here 

 
 
What do our data tell us? 
We can see that, when calculating the figures using the required formulae, we are 
reporting a gap.  It is important that we review this further to understand the reality of 
our gender pay split. 
 
 
What is the gender split within our organisation? 
In January 2018, we looked at our all our employees again to see the percentage of 
female and male employees (excluding casual workers) across the whole organisation…

Then we looked at each of the pay quartiles to see the percentage of women and men in 
each of four levels of pay banding from bottom to top…

This tells us that in general, there is a similar proportion of women and men at each of 
these broad levels of pay across One YMCA, with a slight variation to this in the lower 
mid quartile. 
 
To dig deeper into the detail of this, we looked at the gender split for our employees 
across all pay grades:

These figures relate to actual pay rates for women and men in each pay grade.  For 
those covered by our pay progression scheme, there may be justifiable variations within 
each grade based on individual pay progression outcomes. 
 
You will see that the total employees is lower than the required reporting level of 250.  
This is because at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, our last payroll run had paid over 
250 people (including casual staff) and since that date, we have had some movement in 
overall headcount. 
 
 
What conclusions can we draw? 

  Our data are skewed by our Nursery and Children’s Centre teams being 100% 

female and making up 26% of the relevant headcount for gender Pay Gap 
Reporting purposes - the majority of employees in this Family Work group are in 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 roles 

  These data tell us nothing about equal pay! This is covered under our Job 

Evaluation scheme and triennial pay benchmarking processes. 

  Despite the indicated pay gap, we should note in terms of leadership, that: 
o  Gender split at the top of the organisation will always have a larger 
influence on results (currently three people, two of whom are male) 

o  Over 70% of our service delivery leads are female 
o  Our corporate service leads (Finance, HR, Safety & Compliance) mirror the 

organisational gender split (two female, one male) 

 
 
What are the next steps? 

  We continue to monitor Gender Pay issues through our monthly payroll reports 
  We continue to report externally as at the ‘snapshot’ date (5th April), assuming 

our headcount remains above the level at which reporting is required 

  We continue to abide by our existing processes which ensure we comply with 

Equal Pay legislation (see below) 

  We work towards the recruitment of more males in Family Work 
  We continue to review the composition of our workforce to ensure fairness around 

reward, promotion of talented individuals, recruitment – basing decisions 
primarily on skills, abilities and attitudes 

  We acknowledge that, with a small Executive Team, any pay at the top of the 

organisation will potentially skew the data disproportionally 
  We recognise that some factors are outside of our control: 

In general, more women than men work in the charity sector, 

o 
o  Family Work continues to attract and employ more women than men, 

  Where One YMCA can eliminate imbalances in pay between the genders, it will 

seek to do so. 

 
 
Other notes 
At present the legislation requires us only to report on differences in pay between men 
and women.  We acknowledge that this binary split may not reflect how people self-
identify.  One YMCA does not hold sufficient data to be able to report this issue in a non-
binary way. 
 
One YMCA uses a job evaluation scheme similar to many organisations to ensure job 
roles and salaries are set objectively (i.e. not in relation to any factor other than the job 
itself).  We also undertake an annual review of basic pay which can lead to ‘across the 
board’ cost-of-living related pay increases.  Every three years we undertake a pay 
benchmarking exercise to ensure our pay rates are broadly in line with market rates for 
comparable roles.
