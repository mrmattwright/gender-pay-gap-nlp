GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 
2017

Within the Hyperion Insurance Group we value talent, recognising that it is the commitment and 
contribution from each of our people, wherever they are based, that drive our business forward.

Our gender pay gap reporting currently shows a significant difference in the mean and median pay 
of males and females in all business units in the UK. This is due to the types of roles women are 
currently undertaking, rather than any inequality in pay for like-for-like work. Whilst our Group is 
diverse, with colleagues from many countries, backgrounds and experience, we know that we have 
work to do to close the gender pay gap by increasing the number of women in senior roles.

Our focus now is on understanding how we can support all our employees to build a successful and 
fulfilling career with Hyperion, no matter their gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity or background.

We are focusing on the three areas we believe will have the most impact:

•  Career progression: more ways to support individuals to build a fulfilling career within our Group

•  Culture: continue making the Group a place where all employees feel valued

•  Recruitment: positively working to attract the best talent, and taking appropriate and effective 

actions to redress the gender imbalance.

We are firmly committed to closing the gender pay gap.

I confirm that the information contained in this report is accurate.
