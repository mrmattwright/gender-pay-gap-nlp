Gender Pay Gap Report  

April 2017 

 
Our vison is ‘to ensure excellence is embedded in all that we do’ and our purpose is ‘working 
for the common good by enabling people to develop to their personal potential’. 
 
St  Cuthbert’s  Care  does  not  discriminate  on  the  grounds  of  gender  and  complies  with  the 
Equality Act. We are committed to working to our Dignity at Work policy.   
 
We are a Living Wage employer – the first regional charity in the North East, delivering adult 
social care as part of their work, to be accredited by the Living Wage Foundation. 
 
The St Cuthbert’s Care workforce consists of significantly more females than males. This profile 
reflects  the  nature  of  the  care  sector.  All  employees  receive  a  salary  according  to  our  pay 
scales  which  is  reviewed  on  an  annual  basis  and  agreed  by  our  staff  association  group  and 
board of trustees.  All employees are paid the same rate for the job regardless of gender.

This shows the average (mean) pay gap between men and women’s contracted hourly pay for 
each quartile. The aggregation of different roles within the pay quartiles obscures the fact that 
the charity pays both men and women equally for the same roles.
