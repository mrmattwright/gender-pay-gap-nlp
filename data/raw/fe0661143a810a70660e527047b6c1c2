Gender Pay Gap Report 

Fish Brothers (Swindon) Ltd are confident that men and women are paid equally for performing the 
same role within the group, however a gender pay gap exists because there are a greater proportion 
of men than women in senior roles within the group. We have a male orientated workforce, which is 
in line with many other businesses in the motor industry. Applications from female candidates are 
encouraged and we continually strive to redress this balance. 

 

Pay and Bonus Gap 

The gender pay gap is the difference between the mean or median hourly rate of pay that male and
