The data for pay rate comparisons relates to a snap shot as at 5 th April 2017.  The date for bonus payments relates to bonuses received between May 2016 and April 2017.  The ATB Group UK Ltd has three sites in the UK, located in Norwich, Leeds and Birmingham. At the reporting date, the Group employed 280 people, comprising 254 males and 26 females. All three sites are engaged in the design, manufacture and test of electric rotating machinery. The Birmingham site manufactures small motors and generators. The other two sites manufacture progressively larger equipment weighing up to 40 tonnes and can be considered to be manufactures of heavy industrial equipment. We believe this focus on manufacturing and in particular heavy industry does not appeal to female applicants. Despite this we are happy to say that we have female employees in manual shop floor roles, shop floor inspection, purchasing, planning, sales and finance.
