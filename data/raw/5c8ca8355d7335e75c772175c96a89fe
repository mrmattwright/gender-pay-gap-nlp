KAEFER Limited 

Gender  pay  gap  reporting  requires  employers  with  250  or  more  employees  to  publish  statutory 
calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees  

This report is based on the pay data as of 5th April 2017.  
 
Like many organisations in the Construction industry, KAEFER has a higher proportion of male 
employees, making up 94% of the KAEFER workforce. This is due to the larger proportion of men 
than women in traditional blue collar roles such as Scaffolding, Insulation and Asbestos Removal.  

Within our management structure, a significant proportion of these roles directly link to the services we 
provide and traditionally filled through career progression from our core services.
