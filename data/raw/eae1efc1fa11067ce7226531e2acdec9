KFH Gender Pay Gap Reporting – March 2018 

Introduction 
 
From April 2017, all organisations that employ over 250 employees are required to 
produce an annual report on their gender pay and bonus gap.   
 
A gender pay gap is not the same thing as an equal pay gap.  The gender pay gap is 
defined as the difference in the average earnings between men and women, over a 
standard period of time, regardless of the role they do. 
 
We’re confident that our gender pay gap is not an issue.  Our approach to pay is gender 
neutral by design and any pay gap is driven by the structure of our workforce.  We 
continue to work towards ensuring all of our roles are favourably balanced between 
men and women. 
 
Gender pay and bonus gap 
 
Gender pay gap regulations require us to report on the median and mean for both the 
average pay and bonus gaps as represented in the following table: 
 

Difference between men and women 

 

Pay gap (as at 5 April 2017) 
Bonus gap (12 months to 5 April 2017) 

 

Mean 
16.7% 
25.1% 

Median 

9.9% 
57.3% 

 
We are pleased to report that our mean pay gap of 16.7% compares favourably with 
other organisations nationwide (1).  
 
Across the UK economy as a whole, men tend to occupy more senior roles (and has been 
the case historically in the property industry). This is reflected in the bonus pay gap of 
25.1%, with a greater proportion of men being employed in bonus paying front-line 
roles within the business. This is borne out by 85.0% of men receiving a bonus in the 12 
months up to 5 April 2017, versus 63.1% for women.
