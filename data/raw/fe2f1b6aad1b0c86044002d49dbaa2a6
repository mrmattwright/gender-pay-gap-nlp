pay gap as at 5 April 2017.  The report for Ultra Electronics is as follows:   The mean gender pay gap is 17.2%  The median gender pay gap is 26.6%  The mean gender bonus gap is 59.3%  The median gender bonus gap is 20%  The proportion of male employees receiving a bonus is 48.1%  The proportion of female employees receiving a bonus is 50.3%   Ultra is below the UK’s national mean gender pay gap of 18.1% and UK Manufacturing at 22%.  What are the underlying causes of Ultra's gender pay gap?  Under existing law, men and women must receive equal pay for:   the same or broadly similar work;  work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme;  or work of equal value.   The Board is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of gender, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. Ultra has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their gender (or any other characteristic set out above).  As such, Ultra:   carries out pay and benefits reviews at regular intervals;  provides training for managers and other staff members who are involved in pay reviews; and  evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure.   We are therefore confident that the gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather the gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women undertake within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.
