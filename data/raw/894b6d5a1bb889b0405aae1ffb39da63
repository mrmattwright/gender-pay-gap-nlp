Gender Pay Gap               Our 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report       Gender pay gap reporting requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. The Gender pay gap report is based on data as at 5th April 2017. At this date Hillarys employed 1437 staff with 40% (576) being male and 60% (861) being female. The table below demonstrates that when compared to National statistics for the UK, Hillarys Gender Pay Gap is significantly lower than the UK average of 18% for median pay.  Our Pay Gender Gap is as follows:        Median    Mean      Pay    6.0%    23%      Proportion of staff awarded a bonus during the year to April 17.      Gender    Male    Female      Total    576    861      Receiving Bonus    443    709      % Receiving A Bonus    76.9%    82.3%      This shows a 5.4% difference between the number of woman being paid a bonus for their performance in 2016/17 when compared to the number of men receiving a bonus  Our Bonus Gap is as follows:        Median    Mean      Bonus    0%    81.4%      Pay Quartiles      Quartiles    Male    Male %    Female    Female %      Lower    145    47.9%    158    52.1%      Lower Middle    88    29%    215    71%      Upper Middle    105    34.7%    198    65.3%      Upper    161    53%    143    47%      A large number of roles within Hillarys are defined by role titles particularly in the areas of production, contact centre and administration. Within these roles, which account for almost three quarters of staff employed by the Hillarys’ Group, male and female employees are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs.  The gender pay gap identified above, whilst considerably lower than the national average is driven by the fact that a higher proportion of the women employed by the group are employed within production, contact centre and administrative roles.
