Introduction

Goodwood supports the fair treatment and reward of all staff 
irrespective of gender. The Company are committed to promoting a 
diverse workforce at all levels across the business.

We operate a fair and consistent recruitment process and are proud 
that what could be classed as a male dominated industry (sports) that 
across the Group as a whole the majority of our Companies have a pay 
gap of less than the national average (18%).

This report sets out each of Goodwood’s five Company gender pay gap 
results covering the six key metrics that are necessary under the rules 
on gender pay gap reports.  The figures have been reached using the 
mechanisms that are set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation. 
These are:
•

the difference in the mean pay of full-pay men and women, 
expressed as a percentage
the difference in the median pay of full-pay men and women, 
expressed as a percentage
the difference in mean bonus pay of men and women, expressed as 
a percentage
the difference in median bonus pay of men and women, expressed 
as a percentage
the proportion of men and women who received bonus pay; and
the proportion of full-pay men and women in each of four quartile 
pay bands.

It is important to note that “gender pay gap” is different to “equal pay” 
which is the difference between men and women who carry out similar 
jobs.

The quartiles show the proportion of male and female full-pay relevant employees in four pay bands.  To calculate the bands we 
have ranked the full-pay relevant employees from highest to lowest paid, divided into four equal parts and calculated the 
percentage of men and women in each of these quartiles.
