The school’s approach to pay is set out in the school’s pay policy and the Governing Body aims to achieve equality in its pay and reward arrangements. The Governing Body ensures that teaching staff are paid the correct salary and allowances in accordance with the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document, a national statutory document regulating pay of teaching staff.  The Governing Body ensures that school support staff are paid the correct salary and allowances in accordance with the Employment in Hampshire County Council (EHCC) 2007 Agreement and subsequent variations. The Hay job evaluation scheme, which sits behind the EHCC agreement, provides an objective and gender neutral framework to evaluate the jobs that are carried out within the school.  Our gender pay gap of 20% is not as a result of paying men more than women for the same or equivalent work.  Bonus  Bonus payments indicated are for performance related payments, under which a one-off payment may be awarded to a member of staff.
