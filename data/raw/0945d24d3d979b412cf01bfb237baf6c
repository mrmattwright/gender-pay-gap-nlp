                          Home  Our Homes  Black Swan   About Us  Charter of Values  Dignity Champions  Community  Opportunities    Contact us  News                   Black Swan                             Equality   The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 require us as a company that employs more than 250 people to publish specific information relating to gender pay gaps. This information is below and relates to the 5th April 2018 and our 588 employees:   Our mean gender pay gap was 19.4%.  Our median gender pay gap was 4.8%.  Our mean bonus pay gap was 85.9%.  Our Median bonus gender pay gap was 97.1%.  The proportion of males receiving a bonus was 6.2% and the proportion of females receiving a bonus was 3.1%.  The proportion of males and females in each quartile band is:      Quartile  Women  Men    Upper (75-100%)  71.4%  28.6%    Upper middle (50-75%)  82.3%  17.7%    Lower middle (25-50%)  93.9%  6.1%    Lower (0-25%)  75.5%  24.5%     “As a company we are committed to ensuring that our staff are not discriminated against because of their gender. We never pay differential rates based on gender, only based on the job role itself or length of service. There are inherently more women employed in our industry and at this point in time 475 of our employees are female and 113 are male. This has skewed some of the data as it has been difficult recruiting many male carers. 89% of our registered care home managers are female. To reduce our gender pay gap we are committed to recruiting more male carers and also recruiting or promoting more women into senior management or board level positions. The data has also been skewed significantly by shareholding directors opting for a salary over dividends. In 2019 dividends will be taken to address this. Had this not been the case, in 2018 our mean gender pay gap would have been 5.5% which is an improvement on 2017 (7.5%).”  Tom Lyons- Managing Director    The information below relates to the 5th April 2017 and the 495 people employed at the time of which 401 were female and 95 were male:   Our mean gender pay gap was 7.5%.
