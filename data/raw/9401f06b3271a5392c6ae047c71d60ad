We recognise the right of all of our patients, visitors and employees to be treated fairly and considerably irrespective of age, gender, marital status, religious belief, ethnic background, nationality, sexual orientation, disability and social status.  We are commited to promoting equality and diversity in everything we do.  Equality Act 2010  The Equality Act 2010 gives the us opportunities to work towards eliminating discrimination and reducing inequalities in care.  The NHS already has clear values and principles about equality and fairness, as set out in the NHS Constitution, and the laws under the Equality Act 2010 reinforce many of these.  What does this mean for patients?  Most of us need to visit an NHS service from time to time. Others may rely on the NHS and social care services for help with long-term health conditions or disabilities. Whenever you need healthcare, medical treatment or social care, you have the right to be treated fairly and not to be discriminated against, regardless of your ‘ protected characteristics '. Laws under the Equality Act set out that every patient should be treated as an individual and with respect and dignity.  The laws mean that all NHS organisations like ours will be required to make sure health and social care services are fair and meet the needs of everyone, whatever their background or circumstances.

Gender Pay Gap Reporting  Table 1 provides the Gender Pay Gap for all staff working at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.  The only bonuses that are paid are National and Local Clinical Excellence Awards (CEA) paid to Consultants.  The gender pay gap in both the Mean & Median Pay and the Mean and Median Bonus Pay is largely driven by the male bias amongst our medical staff, who are generally our higher earning staff and make up just over 10% of our total workforce.  As a specialist NHS Trust specialising in orthopaedics, our medical workforce is 87% male and 13% female. The national orthopaedic medical workforce has a strong male bias.  Table 1: Gender Pay Gap Data as of March 2017      Difference in mean hourly rate of pay – mean    33.8%        Difference in median hourly rate of pay – median    26.2%        Employees by pay quartile    Male    Female      Upper quartile    50.9%    49.1%      Upper middle quartile    20.4%    79.6%      Lower middle quartile    20.7%    79.3%      Lower quartile    29.2%    70.8%      Percentage of employees who received bonus pay    Male 5.8%    Female 0.2%      Difference in mean bonus pay – mean    49.5%        Difference in median bonus pay – median    38.9%        We are working with the National Orthopaedic Training Program and groups of fourth year medical students to understand the difference in choice between men and women to specialise in orthopaedics. However, this is unlikely to change in the short to medium term.  The results of recalculating the gender pay gap for staff working at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust excluding medical staff are provided in Table 2. The revised data clearly shows a significant reduction in all gender pay gaps and at a level that is well below the 18% national mean.  The median pay level of our female staff is actually greater than that of our male staff. The 3.66% pay gap is due to the female bias in our Health Care Assistants and Nursing staff, which are paid in accordance with the national pay framework.
