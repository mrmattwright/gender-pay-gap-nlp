The gender pay gap describes the difference between the average earnings of all the women in an organisation compared to the average earnings of all the men in that organisation. This is not the same as equal pay, which is about ensuring men and women doing the same or comparable jobs are paid the same.  We are required to publish the following:   Gender pay gap (mean and median averages)  Gender bonus gap (mean and median averages)  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure   In our organisation, the only bonuses that are awarded are to medical and dental staff through the Clinical Excellence Awards.  UCLH's gender pay information is published on the Government website .  Click here to view a short report summarising our gender pay gap data .  At UCLH the median pay gap is 9.5% and the mean pay gap is 15.4% - this means that the average earnings of men working at UCLH are higher than the average earnings of women. However, there is no mean pay gap if you look at staff on Agenda for Change terms and conditions (i.e. all staff other than medical and dental staff) where the average earnings of women are 0.9% higher than the average earnings of men. The mean gender pay gap for medical and dental staff is 9.1%. The only staff working at UCLH who earn “bonuses” are consultant medical and dental staff who can apply for clinical excellence awards.  This data will be published annually.
