LACOSTE & THE BIODIVERSITY  When René Lacoste adopted the crocodile emblem, he had no idea that 80 years later this logo would be worn by millions of people. Equally, he never imagined that the crocodile could one day disappear. As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandate, Lacoste contributes to the protection of biodiversity worldwide through its involvement in the preservation of crocodiles, alligators, caimans and gharials, as well as the protection and restoration of the ecosystems in which these animals live.      The LACOSTE CSR policy aims first at protecting the collaborators, the working tool and the brand: the Partners & Suppliers Charter LACOSTE clarifies our rules of the game and makes sensitive the collaborators in the CSR stakes.         RAW MATERIALS: A SELECTION IN LINE WITH THE  CSR COMMITMENTS  Fibers, including cotton used in LACOSTE polos respond to high demands that beyond the standards of quality, must also register in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. LACOSTE ensures use cotton did not come from sources at risk in terms of respect for human rights. In this way, LACOSTE supports the RESPONSIBLE SOURCING NETWORK and the CAMPAIGN COTTON PLEDGE fighting against the forced labor and the child labor in cotton fields.

LACOSTE supports the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2017  LACOSTE has built its brand around the consistent production of high quality products, from apparel and home furnishings to fragrances and accessories, and its commitment to conducting business according to the highest ethical and legal standards.  We require all vendors, factories, and contractors to adhere to our Partners & Suppliers Charter which set forth our business, legal and ethical standards in the following areas: occupational health and safety, fair wages and benefits, work hours, transparent record keeping practices, freedom of association, sub-contracting, customs compliance, product safety, conflicts of interest, anti-bribery, environmental sustainability, and prohibitions on child labor, forced labor, prison labor, discrimination, and harassment.

GENDER PAY GAP IN UK  Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation. Gender pay gap reporting is a valuable tool for assessing levels of equality in the workplace, female and male participation, and how effectively talent is being maximised.   At LACOSTE we are committed to ensure that people are treated equally at work, across all levels and locations. This includes making sure they have the same opportunities for recognition, reward and career development.   Diversity and inclusion is paramount to our business to ensure our continued success. We must create a culture where people can be themselves at work, regardless of their gender or any other attribute or choice.
