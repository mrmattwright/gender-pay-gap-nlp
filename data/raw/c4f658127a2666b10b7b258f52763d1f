The two main purposes were:   To strengthen and harmonise discrimination law  Strengthen the law to support progress on Equality   The Act goes a long way towards harmonisation but differences remain in how different Protected Characteristics are addressed. The Act provides the same levels of protection from discrimination across all the Protected Characteristics and all sectors. The Act streamlined, simplified and consolidated approximately 116 pieces of separate equality legislation  The Act places a duty on public sector organisations.  It outlaws direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and victimisation of people with a number of protected characteristics:   Age   Gender   Disability   Sexual orientation    Religion and belief   Race and ethnicity   Disability   Pregnancy and maternity   Marriage and civil partnership  Public Sector Equality Duty  West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust is committed to being inclusive, fair and equitable to our staff, patients, carers and the communities we serve.
