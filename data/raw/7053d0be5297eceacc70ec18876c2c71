Harrow College 

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

Introduction 

 

In 2017, the Government introduced legislation that required all organisations with 250 or more 

employees to report annually on their gender pay gap. The College is covered by the Equality 

Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 that came into force on 31 

March 2017. These regulations underpin the Public Sector Equality Duty and require the 

College to publish their gender pay gap data by 30 March 2018 and then annually, including 

mean and median gender pay gaps; the mean and median gender bonus gaps; the proportion 

of men and women who received bonuses; and the proportions of male and female employees 

in each pay quartile. This report provides the necessary metrics to meet these publication 

requirements.  

The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences 

between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.  

XpertHR has provided relevant benchmarks to enable the College to see how its gender pay 
gap compares with other similar organisations.
