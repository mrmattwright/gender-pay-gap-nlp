Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
Renewi UK Services Limited 

Assessing Renewi UK Services Limited gender pay gap
The UK Government has confirmed its regulations for Gender Pay Gap Reporting (GPGR) for UK companies. 
It requires UK businesses with more than 250 employees to publish their GPGR statistics as at 5 April 2017 
within one year of this date, and then on an annual basis. The method for calculating this information has 
been outlined in detail by the UK Government and the results from every organisation will be published on 
a UK Government website. When calculating the differences  in average earnings, Renewi UK Services  
Limited gender pay gap takes into account all jobs, at all levels and all salaries within the organisation. 

Reporting Renewi UK Services Limited gender pay gap 
The UK Government GPGR regulations have four key requirements:
(1) Reporting the differences in mean and median pay between 
men and women calculated on the basis of equivalent hourly 
pay rates; 

(2) Reporting the distribution of men and women between pay 

band quartiles, calculated using the range of hourly pay rates; 
(3) Reporting the differences in mean and median bonus pay bet-

ween men and women; and 

(4) Reporting the proportion of men and women receiving bonus 

pay in a year. 

All organisations with 250 or more employees are required to  
publish these statistics. As Renewi UK Services Limited falls into 
this category, we are required and  and pleased to publish our 
gender pay gap data, the results of which are published below.

Interpreting the data
The data suggests that although our total female population  
employed is significantly lower than our total male population 
(82%), the difference within the mean pay gap category is  
negligible. We are fully confident that men and women are paid 
equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business.
Conversely however, although the percentage of males and fema-
les receiving bonuses as a proportion of their total populations are 
almost identical, there are variances when analysing both mean 
and median bonus gap categories, 47.2% and 40.5% respectively. 
As explained above, it is recognised that the number of women em-
ployed by Renewi is relatively low. However, this is not uncommon 
in our sector and indeed means that attracting women into senior 
roles can be challenging. As bonuses are calculated as a proportion 

of salary, the lack of women employed in senior leadership roles 
(which attract higher salaries) has a significant effect on the mean 
and median bonus gap calculations. Nevertheless, Renewi continues 
to be committed to attracting and employing women into senior 
leadership roles as outlined below.

Taking action: encouraging women into the company 
It is recognised that the number of women employed by Renewi UK 
Services Limited is low, however this is not an uncommon pheno-
menon in our sector. The below table is provided by Energy and  
Utility Skills (figures published October 2017). With such structural 
and cultural challenges within our sector in the UK, there is some 
work to do to attract women into our industry and across all levels 
within the organisation, both operationally and functionally.

Renewi UK Services Limited remains committed to looking at 
ways to attract more women into employment and places inclu-
sivity firmly at the heart of its recruitment and in 2018 will offer  
inclusive recruitment training for all hiring managers and 
continue to focus on diversity. Further progress will also mean 
the development of KPI’s.  In the past 12 months we have 
successfully recruited women into an operational supervisory 
role at our East London site and a Maintenance Engineer at our 
Wakefield site where these roles have traditionally attracted 
male applicants only.  

Taking action: helping women progress UP 
It is Renewi’s responsibility to continue to create an environ-
ment where all employees reach their full potential. As part of 
our continuous improvement culture, we will see the launch an 
internal Leadership Development programme in March 2018, 
supported by a new e-learning platform, to enhance our people 
development initiatives and improve the capability of our teams 
and individuals.  The programme is designed to improve the per-
sonal development of current leaders and prepare high potential 
employees for the future, ensuing we have a pipeline of talent to 
fulfil our succession planning activities. It is envisaged that as well 
as improving the leadership capabilities of women within Renewi, 
and encouraging them to be considered for internal progression, 
it will in turn make Renewi a more attractive employer as we seek 
to publicise the programme as part of our employer proposition.

Renewi will not stop there however, we will continue to strive to 
increase the number of women employed by Renewi UK Services 
Limited and just as importantly, are appointed in senior positions.
