This is fundamental to an open society and clearly there is more to be done, especially in the area of education, as prejudice still exists and can result in great personal hurt and artificial limitations on careers.”   - Council Leader Gill Brown, December 2013   Introduction to equality  Arun is a diverse district, containing a wide mix of ages, abilities, ethnicities and people with many other differential characteristics. Arun District Council is determined to create an inclusive environment and to positively address any issues brought about by this diversity, both as an employer and as a service provider. We are committed to creating an environment where equality of treatment and of opportunity is both accepted and expected for all employees, potential employees, and users of Council services.
