Taking action.  We are all very proud of the part we play in communities up and down the country.      Our Responsibilities Corporate Social Responsibility       Responsible Lending Our Culture Corporate Social Responsibility      BrightHouse provides much needed investment and jobs in the towns and cities where we operate. It is dedicated to being an environmentally sound business. But our commitment to the community, locally and nationally, does not stop there.  We are all very proud of the part our staff play in communities up and down the country - fund-raising for good causes, by doing everything from cycle rides and sky dives to mountain climbing and cake sales.  The company, its staff and its customers all make a significant contribution to charities, including our chosen charity partner the NSPCC.  We set up the BrightHouse Schools Liaison Programme, through which we partner with schools around the UK, to run workshops to prepare young people for the world of work.  We also work with the Retail Trust and the Furniture Makers Company , which are charities that support our industry.  And we support the The Money Charity and Money Advice Trust , which provide valuable advice on debt and provide help for people in financial difficulties.           NSPCC & Other Charities  We have a particular, passionate focus on supporting efforts to help young people.
