Parkwood Leisure is proud to provide services to the community and attracting and retaining a diverse range of employees 
strengthens our ability to deliver our goals. At Parkwood Leisure, the mean (average) gender pay gap is 9.66% and the 
median (average) gender pay gap is 2.01%. The gender pay gap at Parkwood Leisure is significantly narrower than the 
current national mean (average) of 29% and national median (average) of 18%. 
 
The Gender Pay Gap is different from “equal pay”. Equal pay relates to men and women being paid differently for “like 
work” carrying out the same or comparable jobs. At Parkwood Leisure, women and men in like for like roles are 
remunerated equally. 
 
In the 2017 reporting period, Parkwood Leisure had an overall gender split of 54% male and 46% female. A higher number 
of our management roles were held by women and our part-time roles attract a higher proportion of women. Men held the 
majority of senior roles. The workforce profile is a majority of employees working in part time roles, which is consistent with 
the active leisure sector in which we operate. We aim to make Parkwood Leisure a great place for everyone to work, 
regardless of gender, and to be rewarded fairly. We are committed to ensuring we have a diverse, gender balanced 
workforce where everyone can succeed. 
 
I can confirm that the information and data reported is accurate as at the snapshot date, 5 April 2017.
