Gender and 
Ethnicity Pay  
Gap 2018

The UCL gender pay gap in context

Like most large employers in the UK, UCL has traditionally attracted and employed more men in 
senior posts than women, and more women than men in lower paid jobs. As a result the average 
salary of men across UCL has always been higher than the average salary of women. This is 
generally known as a ‘gender pay gap’.

“ We are working hard 
to further reduce our 
gender pay gap and are 
developing a new Talent 
Strategy to ensure that 
we support all our staff 
to achieve their full 
potential.”

 
Fiona Ryland 

Executive Director of HR

UCL has reduced the mean gap from 19.5% in 2013 to 17.5% now, 
largely as a result of proactive measures to encourage more women to 
seek internal promotion and to apply for our senior roles; and to ensure 
pay decisions take account of the need to close the existing gap. Our 
participation in Athena SWAN1 means that we have ambitious institutional 
and departmental gender equality action plans in place. Initiatives are also 
driven forward by our equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) networks and 
overseen by our ‘50:50’ (gender equality) committee, co-chaired by two 
members of the UCL Senior Management Team.

It should be noted that UCL has no significant ‘equal pay gap’ i.e. staff 
receive equal pay for work of equal value in every pay grade across the 
university. This is very different from looking at the gender pay gap across 
the workforce as a whole. Staff in higher graded jobs as a matter of course 
get paid more than staff in lower graded jobs. The key is to aim for more 
equal numbers of men and women in senior roles. That does present a 
considerable challenge given the structure of our current workforce and our 
low staff turnover rates. However, we believe it is achievable.

We know that the gender pay gap is caused by historical recruitment trends 
and wider norms in society. Yet we need to better understand and address 
the more complex factors behind it at UCL as much as we are able to. 
Given our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion, the presence of a 
gender pay gap remains a very disappointing reality and one that we want to 
remove as fairly as we can and as soon as we can. 

We recognise that, for a small but growing number of people, gender 
does not simply refer to male and female. For the purposes of this report, 
however, our gender pay gap is calculated using the approach required by 
the regulations.

1. The Athena SWAN Charter is focused on advancing gender equality in higher education. UCL is one of only 
thirteen universities in the UK to hold a Silver award.

The fact that the mean gender pay gap is significantly higher than the median

As with many organisations, and the economy as a whole, the key factor behind UCL’s gender 
pay gap is the imbalance of men and women across job levels.

UCL has a 10 grade structure and, in common with many organisations, as 
the grade increases the proportion of female employees reduce. The lower 
quartile hourly rate of pay at UCL is £16.90, which approximately equates to 
grade 6 and below. We can see that below this lower quartile 64% of staff 
are women. The upper quartile hourly rate of pay is £26.11, which equates 
to the top of UCL’s grade 8 and above. We can see a reversal from the lower 
quartile demographic, with female employees only accounting for 37% of 
staff above the high quartile. In terms of a single staff group this is perhaps 
best highlighted by UCL’s professors where 72% are male and 28% are 
female. If 50% of professors were women then the gender pay gap would be 
10
reduced significantly. 
This distribution is the overwhelming reason for the mean and median pay 
gap. This is separate from equal pay, which is the measurement of pay gaps 
for work of equal value. Where equal pay has been measured historically 
there have nearly always been no significant gaps and UCL does not have a 
fairness issue in terms of equal pay for work of equal value. However, where 
UCL do have an issue is the distribution of staff amongst its grades, as 
detailed on the next page.

The graph shows that at grade 3 and below the proportion of female 
employees significantly exceeds males. More tellingly, above grade 6 the 
proportion of male employees rises steeply with a corresponding sharp 
decrease in the proportion of female employees. Once we get to grade 10 
this leaves women being significantly underrepresented – with a 70/30% 
split.
Essentially, female staff are more likely to be employed in roles within the 
lower half of the UCL grading structure and less likely to be employed 
in roles within the top half the UCL grading structure which is the 
overwhelming reason for the gender pay gap. 
In 2013 UCL provisionally reported on its gender pay gap and, at that 
stage the mean gap was 19.5%. Demographics have changed slowly over 
time, but more action is needed to increase diversity at higher levels of 
the organisation which will directly lead to a reduction in the gender and 
ethnicity pay gaps. For example in 2013 only 23% of professors were female 
(and this is around the same proportion as is currently the case across the 
Russell Group). At UCL the proportion has increased to 28%. 
This is a relatively significant shift but clearly more needs to be done if 
an even split is to be achieved. This is a substantial task and not one that 
can be accomplished easily. For example, to have a 50:50 split amongst 
professors, the next 200 male professors to leave UCL would need to 
all be replaced by women. That is perhaps even more difficult given the 
traditionally low turnover of staff.
UCL’s internal promotions process has had a positive effect on 
representation. For example last year 39% of those promoted to professor 
were female, which has increased the proportion of female professors. It is 
hoped that the introduction of the new academic career framework will help 
accelerate this and enhance diversity further.

UCL actually pays comparably few bonuses (under 250 in total), as 
increases are more typically consolidated rises to base salary. The majority 
of bonuses contained within this figure are Clinical Excellence Awards 
(CEAs) – payments agreed and funded by the NHS to reward exceptional 
clinical work. At UCL the majority of clinical consultants who could receive 
CEAs are male and this is the reason for the increased proportion of males 
receiving bonuses. While more men received bonuses than women in 
2016/17 this is based on a very small sample, which creates issues with 
data validity. 
The bonus level figure is again based on a very small number of bonus 
payments, the majority of which are CEA’s. The CEA’s are on average much 
higher than any other bonus payment and more likely to be paid to men. If 
CEA’s are removed from the bonus calculations, to focus only on payments 
that UCL have control over, then the average (mean and median) bonus for 
women is significantly higher than the average paid to men.

Comparable to the distribution of male and female staff, we can see a 
noticeable drop in the proportion of BME staff as we move up each level 
from grade 5. This is where the overwhelming majority of UCL staff are and 
is the cause of the ethnicity pay gap.
As with gender, the distribution and decreasing level of diversity at senior 
levels is the overwhelming reason for the pay gaps by ethnicity. We are 
aware that the reasons for the differential are likely to be very different, but 
this is the issue that needs to be addressed.  
Again, comparable to gender, where equal pay has been measured 
historically there have nearly always been no significant gaps by ethnicity 
and UCL does not have a fairness issue in terms of equal pay for work of 
equal value. 
Unlike gender, as organisations are not required to report their ethnicity pay 
gaps, it is more difficult to obtain reliable benchmark data to compare our 
position. We will work with others, particularly in the Russell Group, to try 
and understand how our gap fits in with the wider picture. 

Analysis

“Thesefiguresshow
us that we have a 
long way to go to 
achieve true equality 
for our BME staff. 
They vindicate our 
introduction of 
measures to ensure 
that all employees 
achieve their potential, 
irrespective of gender 
and ethnicity.”

Professor Ijeoma Uchegbu  
Provost’s Envoy for Race Equality

Actions

There are a range of organisational and societal reasons causing the gender and ethnicity pay 
gap which need to be addressed. UCL is moving towards its target of having 50/50 male/female 
representation at grades 9 and 10, but we acknowledge that progress should be quicker.  
The following summarises our key objectives and example actions already undertaken.

Objectives

Actions taken

 n Bold recruitment – applying positive action measures to the widest 

possible pools of talent

 n Flexible working – including senior job shares, to hang on to talent
 n Shared parental leave – addressing inequality in caring responsibilities
 n Minimising sexual and gender-based harassment – responding better 

and preventing

 n Supporting career progression and improving talent spotting – removing 

unnecessary systemic barriers to promotion and development
 n Inclusive leadership – reducing implicit bias, valuing different 

contributions of talent and leadership, and enabling a culture of 
sponsorship

 n Utilising ‘tie-break’ provisions, implementing robust obligations on search 

firms, pioneering a sector-leading Fair Recruitment Specialist initiative 
 n Ensuring flexible working and job-shares are systemically offered to all 

candidates 

 n Offering generous leave for fathers and promoting senior male role 

models with caring responsibilities 

 n Establishing a Preventing Sexual Misconduct Strategy Group to help 
ensure all women have a positive experience in the workplace and do 
not leave academia 

 n Introducing a new academic career framework for more equal 
advancement of academic careers, piloting talent management 
frameworks, making local promotions procedures more transparent, 
supporting research active academics returning from parental leave 

 n Developing an Inclusive Advocates sponsorship programme, delivering 
wide-spread implicit bias training, offering leadership training for under-
represented groups
