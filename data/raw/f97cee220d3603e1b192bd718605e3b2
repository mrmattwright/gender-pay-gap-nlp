BBC News further defines it as the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Lastly, the Office of National Statistics provides a summarised overview of what is needed within the published reports, which is the difference in median pay between men and women. The Office for National Statistics measures for the gender pay gap are calculated as the difference between median gross hourly earnings (excluding overtime) as a proportion of median gross hourly earnings (excluding overtime) for men. But crucially this measure does not take into account equal pay for equal work.  New legislation surrounding the issue that is the gender pay gap requires that employers with 250 or more employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. From April 2017 employers have up to 12 months to publish this information, making the deadline the 4th April 2018.  For us here at Cardiff University Students’ Union it is an opportunity in which we will take to continue to ensure that we are an equal and diverse workforce.  In relation to other companies across the UK as of the 21st March 2018 BBC News reported that 2,743 firms have published their data so far with results showing that 77% have median gender gap favoring men and 14.3% have a gap favoring women with the remainder having no gap at all.  Around 9,000 more employees are expected to data by the above deadline. The average UK gender pay gap is that men earn 9.4% more than their female counterparts. Below is a table summary of the gap by occupation.     Skilled trades: 24.5%  Process, plant and machine workers: 21.4%  Managers, directors and senior officials: 18.9%  Elementary occupations: 13.5%  Associate professional and technical occupations: 11.2%  Professional occupations: 11%  Caring, leisure and other service occupations: 8.1%  Administrative and secretarial workers: 5.6%  Sales and customer service occupations 4.3%   Cardiff University Students’ Union Backgound  Cardiff University Students’ Union (CUSU) has a vision of working with every Cardiff student to enhance their university experience.

This was based on a spilt of 481 females and 279 males, therefore 63% female and 37% male. These employees consist of both workers (typical student staff) and career staff employees; there are 667 workers and 93 career staff.  Gender Pay Gap Reporting Figures  Below summaries our gender pay gap reported figures based on the 5th April 2017.     Mean: The mean pay gap stands at 8.6% . Meaning, on average, women are paid 8.6% less than men. The mean figures are calculated based on both career and student staff.  Median: The median pay gap stands at 0% . Meaning that the middle pay rate for females and males is equal. This is as a result of the large number of student staff on the same hourly rate. The median figures are calculated based on both career and student staff.  Bonus Pay: No employees receive bonuses.   Pay per Quartile:  Top quartile - Men 65% / Female 35%  Upper middle quartile - Men 48% / Female 52%  Lower middle quartile - Men 35% / Female 65%  Lower quartile - Men 54% / Female 46%  This shows that men are paid more than women in the upper and bottom quartiles of jobs. The quartile figures are only calculated based on the career staff, of which there were 93 employees, with 49.5% being female.  Supplementary Information  The organisaion aspires to demonstrate diversity across the all areas of the company and be representative where possible of society and the students we exist to provide a service for.  In terms of the organisaions current figures, whilst there is a desire to achieve a more neutral balance, the organisaion is confident that employees are being paid fairly for the roles that they undertake. This is achieved through a detailed job evaluation process which ensures all aspects of a post are reviewed and taken into account when salary grades are determined. Cardiff University Students’ Union is committed to ensuring that all staff are treated equitably and fairly under the terms of its policy and practices covering equality, diversity and inclusion. This embraces all terms and conditions of employment of which equal pay for work of equal value is a key principle. We recognises that in order to achieve equal pay for employees carrying out equal work we should operate a pay system which is transparent, based on objective criteria and free from unfair bias on any grounds. CUSU has a bespoke job evaluation process which enables the requirements considered necessary to undertake the role to be assessed against eight key factors each of which has a number of levels. This ensures consistency and fairness for evaluating the pay of different positions.  As a company we provide many benefits and alternative ways in which employees can utilise throughout their employment. This includes some of our other policies within the company certifying that flexibility exists in terms of working patterns and reduced/condensed hours, to support all staff that may have caring commitments. There is also the options of maternity, paternity, adoption leave and special leave to ensure all employees of all genders have a fair choice in their home life decisions.  The organisaion offers and encourages learning and networking opportunities for all genders with some recent events such as Women in Leadership programs; and activity tries to provide mentors for females wishing to progress into senior positions and GOFOD3 International Women’s Day.  Action Plan  50/50 by 2020 is a campaign to encourage organisations across all sectors in Wales to increase the number of women in decision making positions to a representative 50% by the year 2020. In 2017 the company signed up to the 50/50 by 20/20 commitment and aims to aspire to having a gender balance on management teams and at Board level by 2020. This is because the decision making capability will have a balance that reflects the 50/50 gender split and should serve to ensure decisions become more appropriate and effective as they will be based on the full knowledge and experience each gender can intrinsically provide.  The organisation considers that the existing practices in place are sufficient and should lead to further improvements in the gender balance. As the upper quartile was 65% male on the 5th April 2017 and has ready balanced further; and a continued focus will be made to use positive action to attempt to increase diversity across our organisation. As part of this, the organsiaion would consider promoting or recruiting a candidate who is of equal merit to another, but who we reasonable believe has a protected characteristic (as defined by the Equality Act 2010) that is under-represented in the organisation.
