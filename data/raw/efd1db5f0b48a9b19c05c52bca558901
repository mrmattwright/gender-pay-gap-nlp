Although we do not see any gender pay gap as acceptable, the mean gender pay gap in our organisation is lower than the mean national average of 18.4% (source: ONS).  We have for some time recognised the legacy issues the Combined Authority inherited from its predecessor organisations in this area and put in place measures to deliver on our commitment to gender equality.  While there is more to do, there is already evidence of the progress we are making. We have an overall gender balanced workforce, our senior leadership team is now two-thirds female and we also have the only female chair of a combined authority nationally.  We continue to work to eradicate the gender pay gap in our organisation and be a standard bearer for gender equality. Celebrating diversity is central to our values, and we work hard to ensure every member of our organisation has opportunities to achieve their potential.  We are proactive about supporting flexible working and we calculate the pay of all employees using the industry-standard Hay job evaluation system, to ensure that all staff are rewarded fairly and consistently, irrespective of gender. We are implementing a “women in leadership” training programme to support and mentor our existing female employees into more senior roles and a women’s returner programme to help women who have been out of the workforce back into a rewarding career.  This is all part of our commitment to making sure our Combined Authority fully reflects the diversity of the region we represent, and is a workplace where everyone can thrive, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality or any other factor.
