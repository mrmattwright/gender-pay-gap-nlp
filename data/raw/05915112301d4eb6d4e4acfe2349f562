Gender pay gap

Computershare believes that a diverse and inclusive workforce that has equal opportunity and earning ability is a 
powerful driver for business success. This covers many areas, including gender, which is a key focus area for us.

Recent diversity and inclusion focus groups at Computershare have discussed how gender pay gaps are partly 
caused by there being too few women in senior positions, and we recognise that this is true here. While this is not 
an issue that will change overnight, we are committed to changing this signiﬁ cantly and have internal targets in 
place to help drive this. In addition, we are making changes in a number of different areas to enable more women to 
move into higher paying roles. 

We have a policy of promoting on merit and ability, regardless of background. Our global Diversity and Inclusion 
policy reﬂ ects this. You can read the policy here.
