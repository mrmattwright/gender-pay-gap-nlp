Therefore this report is based on data as at 31 March 2017 .  Gender profile   Female: 366 (54%)  Male: 314 (46%)   Mean and median gender pay gaps   Mean gender pay gap: 7.9%  Median gender pay gap 6.4%   (Mean - the average of all the numbers in the dataset) (Median - the figure that falls in the middle of a range when everyone's pay is lined up from smallest to largest)  Pay quartiles by gender     Quartile  Males  Females  Description      Lower quartile  44%  56%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile    Lower middle quartile  44%  56%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at or below the median    Upper middle quartile  44%  56%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile    Upper quartile  54%  46%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile     We have a policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex. In order to achieve this, we:   operate job evaluation methodology to grade all jobs, using the Hay Job Evaluation Scheme to ensure that jobs are paid fairly;  ensure that allowances are awarded fairly and consistently across the Council;  re-evaluate job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure.   The small gender pay gap demonstrates that we are not paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work and may also be as a result of the roles in which men and women undertake within the Council and the salaries that these roles attract.  The next report will be due to be taken as of 31 March 2018 which will provide us with more up to date analysis.
