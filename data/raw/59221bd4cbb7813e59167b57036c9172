The gender pay gap calculations have been independently reviewed and verified.   From 1 June 2017 MBNA became a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group plc and will be included as part of the Group’s gender pay gap reporting processes for 2018 onwards.  I can confirm that the above information is accurate.
