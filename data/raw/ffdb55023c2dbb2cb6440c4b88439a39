To ensure that our commitment to diversity and inclusion spreads throughout our company, Caterpillar established Employee Resource Groups. Employee Resource Groups connect dedicated employees who share similar life experiences or interests. These groups provide opportunities for personal and professional development, and they help drive innovation, too.
