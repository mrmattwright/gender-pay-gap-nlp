We recognise that each individual has something unique and valuable to offer and strive to create a supportive environment where all staff and students can flourish.  The College is committed to ensuring that no individual will be discriminated against. This includes, but is not limited to, the grounds of age, disability, race, gender, sexual orientation, marriage, pregnancy, religious belief or gender reassignment. All staff are expected to take responsibility in upholding this commitment.  Gender Pay Gap Reporting  The College has a firm commitment to ensuring that all staff are treated and rewarded fairly, irrespective of gender. We will report annually on our gender pay gaps, in line with specific information required under gender pay reporting legislation. Wherever possible, the College will take measures to eliminate or reduce any gender pay gaps.
