Details     Last year, the government introduced world-leading legislation that made it statutory for organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on their gender pay gap. Government departments are covered by the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which came into force on 31 March 2017. These regulations underpin the Public Sector Equality Duty and require the relevant organisations to publish their gender pay gap data by 30 March 2018, including;   Mean and median gender pay gaps  Mean and median gender bonus gaps  The proportion of men and women who received bonuses  The proportions of male and female employees in each pay quartile   The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with, and the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are.  The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.  The Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Civil Nuclear Police Authority supports the fair treatment and reward of all staff irrespective of gender.  Our information, as published on the GOV.UK gender pay gap service website shows the following:  Civil Nuclear Constabulary’s Gender Pay Gap Data    Women’s hourly rate is 5.6% lower (mean) and 10.5% lower (median).    Top salary quartile has 82.4% men and 17.6% women    Upper middle salary quartile has 85.8% men and 14.2% women    Lower middle salary quartile has 83% men and 17% women    Lower salary quartile has 75% men and 25% women    Women’s bonus pay is 30.8% lower (mean) and 31.7% lower (median)    7.1% of men and 44.6% of women received bonus pay        Published 3 April 2018            Is this page useful?
