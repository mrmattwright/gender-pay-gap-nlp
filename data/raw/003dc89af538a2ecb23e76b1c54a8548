Gender Pay Gap Analysis        SPS (EU) Limited 2017  Gender Pay Gap Analysis  At SPS, we want to ensure that everyone is rewarded fairly for their work and enjos the same access to all opportunities.  The gender pay gap measures the difference between men and women's average earnings and is expressed as a percentage of men's pay. According to the National Office of Statistics, the overall gender pay gap is currently 18.1%.  The causes of a gender pay gap can be a complex and shifting mix of factors including work, society and family, but by monitoring the pay gap between men and women we can better understand the gap, should one exist.  The UK Government has introduced a requirement on all employers to publish their gender pay gap by April 2018. The calculations below are in line with the new requirements and cover the period from April 2016 to April 2017.  Pay and Bonus Gap - SPS (EU) Limited       Mean  Median    Hourly Pay  1%  5%    Bonus  15%  0%     The above table shows our mean and median hourly gender pay gap and bonus gap as at the snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017 (pay) and the 12 months reference period to 5 April 2017 (bonus)).  We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across the business, and the median hourly pay gender gap of only 5% confirms this.  When looking at our bonus gap, the median % is zero indicating no gap, whilst mean % should be assessed in the context of the actual mean bonus paid being less than £150.  Proportion of Employees receiving a bonus  Male - 77%  Female - 76%  This shows a 1% difference in the number of men and women who received a bonus in 2016/17. As the figures show, we are confident that men and women have equal opportunity to participate in and earn bonus.  Pay Quartiles       Lower Quartile  Lower Middle Quartile  Upper Middle Quartile  Upper Quartile    Men  60%  51%  58%  69%    Women  40%  49%  42%  31%               The above chart illustrates the gender distribution across SPS (EU) Limited in four equally sized quartiles. This analysis shows that there are proportionately more male colleagues than female colleagues in the highest paid quartile.
