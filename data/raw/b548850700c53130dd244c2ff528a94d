  Knowing our Workforce 

Introduction 

1. 
 
1.1    The  following  publication  shows  some  of  the  information  which  the  Council 
continues to gather and analyse on a regular basis to ensure that the Council 
knows and understands the profile of its workforce and any changes occurring 
as a result of staff turn-over, recruitment activity and organisational change. It 
is also used as a reference point for the development of the Workforce Plan 
and is taken into account when implementing and making decisions on new or 
revised staffing policies and procedures for the Council.

2.1   The purpose of the Workforce Profile is to develop a better understanding of 
the workforce and the potential impact of any current and future trends on the 
staffing needed to resource Council services.

Hertsmere Borough Council Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
 
In 2017, the Government introduced legislation that made it statutory for 
organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on their gender pay 
gap. Government departments are covered by the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties 
and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which came into force on 31 March 2017. 
These regulations underpin the Public Sector Equality Duty and require the relevant 
organisations to publish their gender pay gap data by 30 March 2018 and then 
annually thereafter, including mean and median gender pay gaps; the mean and 
median gender bonus gaps; the proportion of men and women who received 
bonuses; and the proportions of male and female employees in each pay quartile.  
 
The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average hourly pay between all men 
and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this 
can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with. The gender pay gap is 
different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and 
women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is 
unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. 
 
Hertsmere Borough Council’s gender pay gap report as at the snapshot date of 31  
March 2017 is below:

Bonuses Paid 
 
For Gender Pay reporting purposes, the classification of ‘bonus’ includes incentives 
and long service awards paid in vouchers.  These are the only ‘bonuses’ which are 
applicable to Hertsmere Borough Council and relate to the period 1 April 2016 to 31 
March 2017.

Gender Pay Gap Analysis 
 
The UK gender pay gap reported by the Office for National Statistics in 2017 is 9.1% 
in favour of men.  Hertsmere’s mean gender pay gap is 1.89% in favour of men and 
median pay gap is 6.70% in favour of women.   
 
The mean hourly rate for men in Hertsmere is £16.34 compared to £16.03 for 
women. 
 
The median hourly rate for men in Hertsmere is £13.39 compared to £14.35 for 
women. 
 
The mean (or average) is higher than the median (or middle number) as a result of a 
positive skew.  There is a larger proportion of staff employed in the lower grades, 
and in these lower grades there are a higher proportion of men employed, 
particularly in Waste Services. 
 
The bonuses paid at Hertsmere relate to long service awards and incentive awards 
for attendance.  The mean gender bonus pay gap is 6.44% in favour of men.  The 
gap is due to the fact that there was one long service award for 30 years paid to a 
male employee, which has skewed the result.  The median calculation is more 
representative in this case, resulting in a 0% gap. 
 
Results show that Hertsmere’s gender pay gap is not a concern.  Annual equal pay 
audits, a structured job evaluation scheme and family friendly policies are key to 
these results.  Whilst no specific action is identified as being required, gender pay 
and equal pay will continue to be monitored closely to ensure that Hertsmere 
maintains this position. 
 
We confirm that the data provided is accurate and has been prepared in accordance 
with The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
