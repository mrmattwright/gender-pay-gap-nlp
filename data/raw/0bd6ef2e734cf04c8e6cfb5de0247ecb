That's not changed since the day we launched; we're still providing great value phone, mobile, TV and broadband services from our HQ in Yorkshire.  At Plusnet, we take our responsibility to create a great working environment for all our people very seriously. And we're proud to say that 44% of the top 46 leaders in our business are women.  As a member of the BT group of companies, Plusnet complies with, and is subject to many of the same policies and processes that BT has in place. For this reason our Gender Pay Gap Report is part of BT Plc.  View our Gender Pay Gap Report    Was this article helpful?   Yes  No    Thanks!
