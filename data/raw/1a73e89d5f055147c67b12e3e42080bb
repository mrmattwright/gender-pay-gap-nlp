Context 

In 2017 the Government introduced new legislation that made it a statutory requirement for 
organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on their gender pay gap.  Government 
Departments and Relevant Public Sector employers are covered by the Equality Act 2010 (Specific 
Duties and Public Authorities) which came into force on 31 March 2017. Data must be calculated 
using a snap shot date each year.  This will always be 31 March for Public Authorities subject to the 
Specific Duties Regulations, and 5 April for all other employers. Employers have up to 12 months 
from their snap shot data to publish their report, which must include: 

  Mean and Median Gender Pay Gaps 

 

 

  Mean and Median Gender Bonus Gaps 

 

  Proportion of Male and Female employees receiving bonuses 

 

  Proportion of Male and Female employees in each quartile pay band 

 
 

The Gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women within 
the workforce. 
 
The Mean gender pay gap looks at the difference between the mean hourly rate for all male full pay 
relevant employees and all female full pay relevant employees 
 
The Median gender pay gap looks at the difference between the median hourly rate of pay for all 
male full pay relevant employees and all female full pay relevant employees. 
 
The data must include employees Ordinary Pay, Allowances and payments in respect of annual leave 
but does not include payments for Overtime. 

Gender Pay reporting is not the same as reporting on Equal Pay.  Equal Pay looks at the differences 
in the actual earnings of both men and women who undertake equal work.

Our workforce  

We have collected our data at the snap shot date of 31 March 2017, at which point our total number 
of employees was 337. This was made up of 232 women (69%) and 105 men (31%).     

The National Portrait Gallery broadly follows the Civil Service grade structure for its roles, with these 
ranging from Front of House and Administrative roles (AA/AO) to Director of the Gallery (SCS level). 
Analysis of our data shows that the majority of the Gallery’s workforce sits within the more junior 
roles, of which the largest proportion are female:

As an employer the National Portrait Gallery is keen to support flexible working for all employees.  
The breakdown of part time working across the Gallery at the snap shot date is below.  This data 
again shows that the largest proportion of employees working part time are female.

Gender Pay Gap analysis 

The findings of the initial Gender Pay Report by the National Portrait Gallery shows that there is a 
Mean Gender pay gap of 8.3% and a Median pay gap of 13.1%.  The UK National Pay gap is 18.1%.  

The Gallery’s workforce is predominately female which may in some way explain why the median 
average for women is lower.  The figures show that the majority of junior roles within the Gallery are 
undertaken by female employees and that the majority of senior roles are not occupied by males.  

As part of the analysis for understanding why the pay gap exists within the Gallery we have looked at 
the average length of service of our employees.  With male employees having on average 8 years’ 
service compared to the female average of 5 years, an element of the pay gap could be explained 
through the differential in length of service, with male employees having served, on average longer 
in post.   As salary increases within the Gallery are related to the annual Pay Review and annual Staff 
Review process this may have an impact on the disparity in basic pay across the workforce.   

The Gallery does not pay bonuses as part of employee remuneration and therefore at the snap shot 
date there is no data to report within this area. 

 

The table below sets out the overall mean and median gender pay gap for the Gallery’s employees 
at the snap shot date of 31 March 2017.

The National Portrait Gallery has a large proportion of female employees employed within the more 
junior roles across the Gallery.  The data within the quartiles shows that whilst the largest 
proportion of female employees sit within the Lower Quartile, the largest proportion of male 
employees sit within the Upper Quartile.

Closing the Gender Gap 

 

 

As an employer the National Portrait 
Gallery is an advocate of Flexible Working 
and has a strong policy to support all 
employees, regardless of gender or length 
of service, in their requests to work 
flexibly to support a more even work life 
balance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

During 2018/19 we will review 
and update our Equality Action 
Plan to ensure that equality and 
diversity is embedded across all 
aspects of our work. 

 

 

The National Portrait Gallery has 
recently developed a pay policy 
which will come into effect from 1 
April 2018. This policy will provide 
clarity on our approach to pay 
which will help ensure consistency 
around issues such as starting pay.  
The impact of this policy will be 
reviewed as part of future Gender 
Pay Reports produced by the 
Gallery.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The National Portrait Gallery understands that gender 
equality relies on the development opportunities given 
to employees to support them in their career 
progression.  We will take steps to make a broader 
range of training programmes accessible to all 
employees within the Gallery wishing to develop in 
their career. 

 

The National Portrait Gallery is an 
accredited London Living Wage 
employer and has increased all pay for 
applicable employees to the new 
minimum hourly rate from November 
2017.  This will have an impact on 
closing the gap for employees in more 
junior roles.
