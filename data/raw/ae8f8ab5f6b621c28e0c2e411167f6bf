Gender Pay Gap
2017 Reporting Year
As a firm with more than 250 employees BDP is 
required to publish six calculations every year 
showing the size of the pay gap between its male 
and female employees.  
Our pay gap figures provide a snapshot of the 
situation as at March 2017 and are expressed as 
the percentage difference between the average 
hourly earnings of men and women.

At intake level we have a fairly 
equal gender balance. We aim to 
provide a level playing field for 
everyone across the practice to 
ensure that women who choose 
to make a career with BDP will 
succeed on merit alone. 
BDP was founded on a culture 
of collective responsibility. 
The practice’s ethos of the 
‘continuous collective’ instils 
in our teams a sense of family 
and, as a family of studios, we 
aim to be more inclusive, more 
supportive and more encouraging. 
We realise that our goals cannot 
be achieved overnight but we 
expect to see an improvement 
in our 2018 figures as a result of 
the actions we have already put 
in place.

Gender Pay Gap Statement
As one of the largest employers of 
female architects in the country, 
we particularly recognise that our 
gender pay gap needs to improve 
and we have already embarked 
upon a comprehensive action 
plan to that end. Actions taken to 
date include equal opportunities 
and unconscious bias awareness 
training, clear guidance on steps 
to promotion, mentoring and 
leadership programmes and 
enhancements to our flexible 
working policy. 
       
It has also been helpful to actively 
support and partner wider 
initiatives which raise awareness 
about gender inequality such as 
the AJ/AR Women in Architecture 
programme. Our efforts to date 
have been recognised in our 
shortlisting for the NCE100 
Diversity Champion award. 
We are confident that women 
and men doing the same job 
in BDP are paid the same. Our 
bonus payments are not awarded 
on a discretionary basis but 
are determined by our profit 
distribution system for all staff 
which is linked to pay and grade. 
Our gender pay gap reflects the 
simple fact that at BDP there 
are more men at senior level 
than women. This is something 
we are committed to changing 
and we aim to accelerate our 
understanding of those issues 
that impede the progress of 
women in practice and to take 
action to break down those 
barriers.
