Our comprehensive corporate and social responsibility policy applies across every aspect of our business.          Page Sections     Page Sections     Our commitments     More      Our commitments      Contact Us                      Charity work    We have an ongoing programme of donating to good causes and charities. We also encourage our staff to do the same and get involved in fundraising activities. To help facilitate this, we grant all of our staff the opportunity to take two days of paid leave per annum to dedicate to charity fundraising.             Equality of opportunity    We are committed to never discriminating against age, race, gender or disability. We want our workforce to reflect the diversity of our customers. Where possible, we operate a flexible working policy (including homeworking) to facilitate the needs of our staff. We also invest in the continual training of our staff to ensure our values and policies are always embedded throughout the company.             Freedom of information    For organisations that require it, we freely publish statistics measuring our corporate and social responsibility progress. This includes a breakdown of employees by sex and race; energy use; social investment; health and safety; expenditure on travel; and quality attainment.             Gender pay gap    The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations introduced the requirement for organisations, of a certain size, to calculate and publish their gender pay and bonus gap information by early April 2018.  As a business we are pleased that the legislation has been introduced and that this issue has been highlighted and prioritised.    Download our Gender Pay Gap report           Green issues    We continually strive to be more energy efficient and to reduce our impact on the environment. This includes a commitment to recycling and waste management; investment in energy-efficient technologies (such as virtualisation); and the utilisation of homeworking and web conferencing to reduce travel.             Partner selection    A rigorous selection procedure applies for every third-party organisation we work with. This ensures that every element of our services, even when provided by a partner, meets the same high standards. Factors include health and safety; freedom of association; discrimination; working hours; and payment.             Value for money    We continually monitor the market to ensure that our prices remain competitive, and we always strive to offer the best value for money. Also, by operating a truly nationwide network of training centres we ensure that our customers can minimise their travel costs when training.             Youth investment    We have been avid investors in the younger generation for a long time. We operate a range of advanced IT apprenticeships for school leavers, and we have designed our own IT graduate scheme to help STEM graduates into the IT industry.
