Our Corporate Responsibility principles are based upon our core values and cover the following areas:   Work place and work environment (employees, contractors and subcontractors)  Market place (clients, suppliers, partners)  Environment & Sustainable Development  Community (local and wider)   Sustainability  At Taziker Industrial we believe that sustainability is only achieved when the economic, social and environmental aspects of our operations are in balance. To help us achieve this, we have identified the following key areas within our Sustainable Development Strategy which we feel are critical to the success of the programme:   Environmental   Waste & Pollution  Noise & Vibration  Biodiversity  Climate Change adaption  Resource Efficiency  Energy Efficiency     Economic   Value for Money & Affordability  Asset Stewardship  Whole Life Cost  Regional Economic Development  Supply Chain engagement     Social   Community Relations  Community Investment  Diversity & Accessibility  Safety  Employee Health & Wellbeing    Sustainable Development is our road map to achieving Sustainability; we’re passionate about what we do and we feel this the right thing to do in terms of operating a successful long term business.  Instilling a culture of Sustainability into our business won’t happen overnight; we’re committed to raising awareness within our workforce so that everyone understands our strategy and their role in contributing to our shared success. We’re embedding this ethos by building a positive culture that enables our staff to meet the challenges of sustainable asset management in a world threatened by ever decreasing resources.  This ambition requires us all to work safer and smarter, to minimise our impact on the physical and social environment, creating long-term beneficial relationships within communities and with our clients. Key to this is learning from our experience, whilst empowering employees to proactively contribute energy, ideas and talent to help to improve our performance.  Some recent successes we've celebrated are:   Star Award & Platinum Badger - For Environment and Safety performance we were awarded the Network Rail Star Award and later the Platinum Badger Award for continued excellence in Environmental Risk Management.  £20,334 donated to local charities in 2014, part of our initiative to donate £500 per worksite in CP5.  Support for local community projects such as sponsorship of Glasgow City U17’s football team.  Investment and Development of 12 new graduates throughout our business.  Use of new sustainable technologies such as electric Blasting systems, GRP Panels and Eliminator Waterproofing systems.  In 2014, 97% of all our non-hazardous waste was diverted from Landfill. We’ve now begun a partnership to manufacture our hazardous grit blasting abrasive into usable concrete blocks.   Wellbeing  At Taziker Industrial, we recognise that the health and wellbeing of all of our staff is critical to the long term success of our business; and given the challenging environments in which we work, it’s simply the right thing to do to look after all those who work for us.  All of our people undertake an annual Self Certification Medical followed by a visit to one of our Appointed Doctors; here they receive Eye Sight, Blood Pressure & BMI checks and a one-to-one consultation to discuss any health concerns in confidence.  Operational staff, exposed to Noise, Chemicals, HAVS & Dust undertake further examinations; these include Audiometry measurement to check for hearing loss, Dermatitis checks, HAVS & WBV assessments and Lung Function tests. They also provide a Blood and Urine sample every 3 months to measure their lead exposure and identify any related conditions at an early stage.  We also offer a confidential Counselling Service to our staff through our nationwide healthcare providers; this service has been used by our workforce to work through personal matters.  To promote and encourage a good hygiene culture, Operational staff who maintain a blood lead level below our annual KPI receive a £50 bonus after each quarterly check.  Isocyanate Testing  Isocyanates are one of the trickiest aspects of our work, as you cannot determine the quantity of Isocyanates within all other Volatile Organic Compounds present within the work areas. To identify exposure we undertake urine analysis of those exposed. We investigate the cause/controls of any diamines reported in urine over 1µmol.  If improperly controlled isocyanates can cause respiratory issues and sensitisation to isocyanate containing products. We control exposure by designing out the use of such products, installing mechanical air ventilation and issuing suitable face fit tested RPE to our staff.  Appointed Doctors  We continue to expand the number of HSE Appointed Doctors we have on-board, providing greater geographic coverage for our workforce. This year we have appointed new doctors under the Control of Lead at Work Regulations in London, Newcastle and Liverpool.  Training & Development  One of the main advantages of Taziker Industrial is our ability to deploy a large multi-disciplined workforce. In order to maintain the level of competence necessary to achieve our goals we invest in each and every one of our employees through a strategic training and development plan, with individual continual professional development plans established for all staff and reviewed every 6 months. One of our key principles is access to training for all, that’s why we do not set a training budget, if an employee feels they require additional training to assist their current role or progress onto the next level we are pleased to support and nurture this growth.  Safety  At Taziker Industrial the most important aspect of our work is protecting everybody that comes into contact with our projects. This means our own staff, our clients, and members of the public that are affected by our works. With a goal of ensuring that all our staff leave in the same (if not better) condition than when they arrived; we have tailored all our processes and initiatives towards achieving this. We can only do this with the full support of our workforce – they are the ones that will ensure we become renowned for our approach to the management of safety and our resulting record. The cornerstone of our approach to safety is our Integrated Management System (IMS), which far exceeds global ISO standards. We keep the system simple and easy to use, with an emphasis on personal responsibility instead of unnecessary paperwork; increasing its effectiveness. This provides us with the framework to build innovative working practices and implement a culture of commitment to safety through:   Collaboration – internally and externally to share best practice and lessons learnt  Management – competent and approachable managers who listen to people at all levels of the organisation  Behaviours – teaching our staff how their behaviours influence their safety and encourage a positive and supportive approach  Technology – unlike many companies, we are not afraid to try out new technology. From apps to innovative new tools and equipment; we invest in improving.  Continual Improvement – we don’t just identify issues and forget about them once they’ve been addressed; we constantly monitor and tweak our solutions. For example, we utilise Root Cause Analysis techniques to fully understand Close Calls and Incident.   This will be achieved through:   Reporting – We have worked hard to change the culture in our organisation so that our staff feel able to report close calls and feedback on issues they have on site. By ensuring we know about close calls, we can investigate the cause and identify trends.  Appropriate Training – We commit to ensure that our staff receive all the training they need to do their jobs, as well as any training they feel they need to progress or just to carry out their role more effectively.  Safety Campaigns – Where they are delivered in a fun, informative and targeted way; safety campaigns, including posters, can be effective in conveying important information to our staff.  Auditing & Safety Tours – Our Health and Safety Team don’t just attend site to ensure the paperwork is correct. They tour our sites to talk to all levels of staff on site and see problems with their own eyes.  Refusal to Work System – By utilising the ‘Worksafe’ system, we encourage our staff to have the strength to say no if they believe their safety may be compromised in any way.  ‘Honesty Chats’ and Shutdown Days – We have a workforce of experienced personnel who know how to do their jobs inside out. We make sure that we make time to listen to them and take their concerns and suggestions on board.  Presentations & Workshops – Whether there is important information that we need to convey to our teams or we want to collect and utilise their knowledge; we invest in delivering these types of events.
