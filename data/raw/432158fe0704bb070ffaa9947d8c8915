We welcome the implementation of gender gap pay reporting as an important step forward to ensure progression and to boost better opportunities for women in all industries.  We are committed to ensure equal opportunities and equal pay for our employees. We have always made sure that our females employees are paid equally where they perform the same role as their male work colleagues. More junior roles are paid on an hourly basis in accordance with the National Minimum Wage.  The Food and Beverage industry has traditionally been male dominated due to working hours across evenings and weekends which in general has attracted more male applicants than female. Therefore, the percentage of females in more senior positions is lower. Although our mean pay gap at 7.5% and median pay gap at 6% are well below national averages of 14.1% and 18.4% respectively (Office of National Statistics, 2017), this still suggests that there are areas where we can improve in order to increase the number of females at more senior roles through offering more flexible working arrangements or part time opportunities. The gap in junior level roles appears to be age-related rather than gender-related, driven by the National Minimum Wage pay structures.  We have always been passionate about thriving and developing our employees regardless of their gender or background. We will continue to review how to attract and retain more women into our company as well as encouraging and promoting their progression into more senior roles toward the upper quartiles of our business.  I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate.
