Achievement of this award is based on evidence of promotion and monitoring of equality and diversity activity within all aspects of College life – both as an employer and with students. Natalie Davison – Terranova Principal/Chief Executive said: “Achieving the Gold Equality Standard has taken us through a very important process which has raised awareness, both internally and externally, of what we do in relation to equality and diversity for our students, staff and communities. I know all staff worked incredibly hard and the exceptional rate of staff achievement of the Level 2 Equality and Diversity qualification (81% of staff now hold the qualification) will undoubtedly have contributed to this, well done!”  The existence of the Equality and Diversity Scheme will be publicised widely around the college and copies will be available from Student Services. The policy can be made available in alternative formats via requests from Student Services.

This Scheme is intended to set out our commitment to equality and diversity and to demonstrate that equality and diversity are at the heart of what we do. The operation of the Single Equalities Scheme will be monitored by the Equality and Diversity Working Group. The overall responsibility for the implementation of the Single Equalities Scheme lies with the Principal. Students who feel that they have been unfairly discriminated against, or who have any grievance related to equality of regard or opportunity, are encouraged to seek advice from Student Support.  Training and development  To support its commitment to equality of opportunity the College will assist staff to meet their professional obligations in respect of the policy. Training and other opportunities will be provided to encourage staff to become fully aware of the issues and of good practice in the field of equal opportunities, so that they may act with understanding, confidence and integrity.  Infringement  The right of every student to equality of regard and of opportunity, as embodied in the Single Equalities Scheme, is fundamental to all aspects of operation of the College. This means that direct discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, ethnic origin, gender, marital status, medical condition, religious belief or sexual orientation is not acceptable, and the College will take appropriate disciplinary action where individuals discriminate, or incite others to discriminate, in this way. Equally, the College will not accept indirect discrimination, in which a regulation or procedure leads to unfair treatment, exclusion or disadvantage in respect of a particular group even though the regulation or procedure itself is not intended to have this effect.
