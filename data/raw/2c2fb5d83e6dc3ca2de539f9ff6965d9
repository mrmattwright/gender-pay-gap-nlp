Gender Pay Gap 
Report 2017

Group    

Introduction

Johnston Press is an innovative multimedia 
company, delivering quality and trusted content 
with strong local engagement. We are at the 
heart of the communities we write about - 
enabling us to provide timely, accurate and 
reliable news and information, all free from 
proprietorial influence.

Therefore, we strongly support the government 
legislation requesting companies with 250 
employees or more to publish data on their 
gender pay gap.

We know that by sharing this report, we are 
sharing data that highlights that we have a 
mean (average) gender pay gap of 15.1%. The 
principal reason for our gender pay gap is that 
we have more men in higher paid senior roles. 

As so many of these reports are confirming, this 
is unfortunately the case at many organisations 
and underlines the need for conscious and 
earnest change.

We do have some positive and encouraging areas of 
our business. Of our 30 editors, 13 are female and 17 
are male. However, we can do much better and I  
want us to be better. 

We have created a Gender Pay Review Group whose 
task will be to investigate all areas of gender 
diversity, and any inequalities that may exist in the 
company. This volunteer group will comprise of 
males and females across all functions of the 
business, headed up by Cathy Southgate, our Group 
Financial Controller, with direct oversight from 
our Chair of the Board, Camilla Rhodes.

This group will report to the Board quarterly with 
solutions for addressing all aspects of diversity in 
the organisation, but particularly with regard to 
gender issues. This group will also work with the 
Human Resources team to better understand and 
overcome the barriers to progression for female 
talent. 

We aim, as a result of setting up this group, to 
achieve a 50/50 gender balance in our Senior 
Leadership Team within 5  years. 

We also aim to reduce the gender pay gap each 
year, starting now. 

Alongside the Gender Pay Review Group, we will 
ensure that we always have a diverse candidate 
shortlist for all Senior Leadership Team roles. 

We don’t have all the answers straight away and 
part of forming the Gender Pay  Review Group is 
to encourage an interactive, inclusive and 
considered process whereby we listen to our 
employees about what we could change for the 
better. 

The data contained in this report for Johnston 
Press Group is accurate.

Closing this 
gap

Johnston Press fully acknowledges that there is a historic prevalence of males 
fulfilling senior level roles. As a multi-media group that provides trusted, quality 
news for regional, local and national communities, we know that our voice has to be 
both fair and representative. While thirteen of our thirty editors are female (with 
eight of our fourteen daily titles edited by females) we know we have a lot of progress 
to make across the company. The Board has committed to finding positive and 
effective solutions to address all aspects of diversity, but with a particular focus on 
supporting the development and progression of female talent.

Our next 
steps...

We have created a Gender Pay Review Group whose starting remit will be to address the issues 
identified within this report. This group will be led by Cathy Southgate, our Group Financial 
Controller, with direct oversight by our Chair of the Board, Camilla Rhodes.  The Gender Pay 
Review Group will report quarterly to the Board with recommendations to address all aspects of 
diversity in the organisation, but particularly with regard to gender issues.
