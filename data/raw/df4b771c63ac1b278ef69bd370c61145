Pay Gap Report
Pay Gap Report

Our data shows we have significant work to do to reduce our 
gender pay gap and we are committed to building a fair, inclusive 
and diverse culture. 

We recognise and value the talent and contribution women bring 
to HomeServe and are putting measures in place to ensure women 
have every opportunity to progress their careers and reach the 
highest level; and are rewarded equitably and fairly.

In 2017 we formed a group-wide people Committee, led by Stella 
David, our senior independent director, to ensure our overall people 
led strategy and policies are fair and inclusive.

Some of the measures the people Committee is overseeing include:

•  A greater focus on diversity to identify and action measurable steps we can 

take to improve diversity at all levels

•  Openness and transparency in promotion opportunities

•  Openness and transparency in succession planning processes

•  Developing a group-wide approach to Learning and Development, 

specifically targeted towards women

•  Overall plan for best practice framework approach to recruitment.

I confirm that this data is accurate.
