My name is Philip Bowditch. I have been privileged to be Chief Executive Officer of our Trust since June 2016. I hope this page gives you something of the essence of what, I believe, is a very special ‘BWMAT family’.  Our driving force is to ensure every school within our Trust provides an outstanding education for every child, enhanced by a distinctively Christian ethos. We want to provide every child with an outstanding education of the mind, body and spirit through: a creative, innovative, engaging curriculum underpinned by the Christian values of kindness, respect, forgiveness, perseverance and love; an education with the highest aspirations and expectations of academic success where learning focuses on and values developing children’s characters and qualities as human beings.  Our Trust was established in 2012. Our nineteen primary schools range in size from 115 to 460 pupils and cover the 0-11 age range. BWMAT schools are clustered into three hubs in North Somerset, Taunton and South Somerset and are located within market towns and more rural communities. (updated information on the profile/improvement of schools)              People are at the heart of our Trust – pupils, teachers, teaching assistants, staff, middle leaders, Head teachers, governors and central support staff – all with a wide range of unique talents, qualities, beliefs and potential. We seek to provide opportunities for all of our practitioners to share best practice, develop expertise, draw on local, national and international research and form partnerships within and beyond the BWMAT.  We share a determination every child within the BWMAT will access an outstanding education, every child will achieve what they hope for their future and we will work together to be keepers of the flame of ‘Life in all its fullness’.  .
