Gender Pay Report  - March 2018

Narrative

Our Service and Construction business carries out 
installation, repair and maintenance of offshore wind 
turbines. The majority of our employees have a technical 
mechanical/engineering background from other offshore 
industries or the merchant navy. These are historically 
predominately male roles and so our employees are 
similarly predominately male. This is also true of the 
candidates who apply for our open positions.

Our Manufacturing business is also predominantly male 
as large scale manufacturing has historically struggled to 
attract female applicants and this trend is still apparent.

Thus, our figures show that we have a high proportion of 
men at all levels of the business, as shown in the below 
breakdown of headcounts in each quartile.

The figures show that our gender pay gap is substantially 
below the UK average of 18 percent. On the Median  
measure women are paid 2.2% more than men.

All employees are part of our bonus program – if the 
company is successful in achieving its targets then all 
employees benefit. Again, we see that on the Median 
measure women are not disadvantaged by this  
approach, being paid 10.6% more than men.
