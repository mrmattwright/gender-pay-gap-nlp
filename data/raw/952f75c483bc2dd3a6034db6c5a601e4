Underlying cause of Gender Pay Gap 
 
Ringlink Services Ltd is confident that we have equal pay however we do have a Gender Pay 
Gap.  The reasons for this are highlighted below. 
   
Ringlink Services Ltd is a Temporary Workers Agency which provides labour predominantly 
to the Agricultural Sector, which traditionally is dominated by males. 
 
Ringlink Services Ltd also provides training to many varied industries and has a Management 
Team in place to co-ordinate the organisation of  courses and tests.  Bonuses are paid to this 
team,  annually  on  Company  performance,  on  completion  of  10  yearsâ€™  service  and  meeting 
targets, this accounts for the smaller proportion of Males and Females receiving bonuses.  
 
This is particularly significant this year due to 1 member of staff being eligible to receive a 
bonus  under  all  areas.  This  has  had  an  impact  on  the  Mean  Bonus  Gap,  due  to  the  staff 
member being female.   
 
Our Gender Pay Gap Median rate is 8.3% which compares very favourably with the National 
Average Rate of 18.4% 
 
Employers Actions to address Gender Pay Gap 
 
Ringlink Services  Ltd is actively promoting the  Agricultural  Industry in schools throughout 
Scotland  to  attract  Males  and  Females  into  the  sector.    They  are  also  working  closely  with 
Ringlink  (Scotland)  Ltd  on  their  Pre  Apprenticeship  Scheme  which  is  aimed  at  getting 
youngsters (Male & Female) into the Agricultural Industry. 
 
Progress is being made and we will continue to work towards narrowing the gap.
