Bury Council is committed to the principles of equality and has, for a number of years, been carrying out annual Equal Pay Audits and analysing pay data.  Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 we now have a requirement to calculate, report and publish gender pay gap data. There are very specific rules and criteria around how the figures are calculated which means that the results cannot be compared to last year's Equal Pay Audit. To calculate our gender pay gap we have taken a 'snapshot of data' as at the 31 March 2017.
