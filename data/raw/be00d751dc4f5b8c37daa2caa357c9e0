Reporting requirements 
 
The regulations require reporting on pay and bonuses as follows: 
 

  Mean (average) gross hourly rate of pay  
  Median gross hourly rate of pay 
  Proportion of male/female in hourly rate of pay quartiles (four bands) 
  Mean bonus pay 
  Median bonus pay 
  Proportion of male/female in receipt of bonuses, in the 12 months before the snapshot date 

 
 
Our key findings 
 
Pay: 
 
The overall average pay gap is 11% for RWG (Repair and Overhauls) Limited. 
 
The key findings that explain this gap are consistently related to gender distribution across occupations 
and job levels.  
 
Our analysis shows:  
 

  Males make up a significant majority of the workforce. 
  Females make up the largest proportion of part time workers, however this has no impact on 

full time equivalent pay. 

  A  clear  job  grading  structure exists  which  ensure  roles  at equivalent  levels  are  paid equally 

irrespective of gender. 

 
 
Bonus: 
 
The overall RWG (Repair and Overhauls) Limited mean bonus pay gap is -7%; the median is -65%.  
 
Our analysis shows: 
 

  Most females form part of the staff bonus plan whereas most males form part of the workshop 

bonus plan which has an impact on the overall figure. 

  Pro-rata  payments for some pay  elements due to the high  number of part time workers has 

impacted the bonus figures used in the calculation. 

 
We are confident that our gender pay gap does not reflect an equal pay issue nor is it related to paying 
males and females differently. 
 
This report details the  gender pay  gap reporting requirements covered under The Equality  Act  2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. The regulations require companies with more than 
250 employees to publish information on their gender pay gap. 
 
 
Accuracy statement 
 
I confirm the gender pay gap data contained in this report is accurate and has been produced in  
accordance with the regulations.
