UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017INTRODUCTION

DEE SAWYER

Head of Human Resources

At T. Rowe Price we are committed to diversity and 
inclusion. It is an integral part of our core values as 
well as a long term, strategic business priority. 

The sharing of our Gender Pay Gap Report enables 
us to have meaningful conversations around how we 
can continue to identify and develop new ways of 
attracting, developing and retaining a diverse pool of 
talent globally. We have work to do to reduce the gap 
and build on the wide range of diversity and inclusion 
initiatives underway across T. Rowe Price. 

Our gender pay gap statistics illustrate an aggregate 
gap in our pay for women versus men. However, 
the presence of a gender pay gap is not the same 
as an equal pay issue, as equal pay relates to men 
and women being paid the same for doing the same 
work. We have processes in place to ensure our 
approach to pay and reward for our people is based 

on fairness and equality. Our gender pay gap is driven 
by lower female representation in roles that typically 
have higher levels of compensation - primarily in our 
Investments and Sales functions.   

We are committed to addressing the representation 
gap through initiatives such as identifying additional 
sources of diverse talent and implementing programs 
that address barriers to progression for women. 
These initiatives will take time to bear results but 
will help us reduce the representation gap and 
consequently, the gender pay gap.

UNDERSTANDING THE GENDER PAY GAP

What is Gender  
Pay Gap Reporting?
The UK government now requires certain UK companies to publish gender pay 
gap information. From April 2018, all companies in the UK with 250 employees 
or more are required to publish a report with specific gender pay metrics on an 
annual basis. 

What is the Difference Between 
Equal Pay and the Gender Pay Gap? 
  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the average earnings 

of men and women across an organisation. 

  The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay relates to men and 

women being paid equally for equal work. 

There are six calculations that employers need to provide: 

1.  Average gender pay gap as a mean average;

2.  Average gender pay gap as a median average;

3.  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average;

4.  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average;

5.  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females 

receiving a bonus payment;

6.  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from 

lowest to highest pay.

The above data illustrates the gender distribution at T. Rowe Price in the UK across four equally sized 
pay quartiles. As the image shows, whilst we have a large proportion of women in the lowest pay 
quartile, we have less female representation at senior levels. This difference in distribution across the 
pay quartiles - with fewer women in senior and other roles that provide the highest compensation - 
is the key driver of our gender pay gap. We are focused on improving diverse representation in our 
investment, sales and senior management roles and have a number of diversity and inclusion initiatives 
underway to achieve this, details of which are highlighted in subsequent pages within this report.

This data illustrates the gender distribution 
across different business segments and 
roles. As the data shows, we have less female 
representation in our investment roles. These 
roles typically tend to have higher levels of pay 
than other roles.

Our London-based associate population is 
more concentrated on investment and sales 
professionals and therefore may indicate 
a higher gender pay gap than other firms 
with a broader associate population in their 
UK entities.

Pay and Bonus Gap

Proportion of Associates Awarded a Bonus

The table below reflects our overall mean and median gender pay gap and bonus gap for the 
reporting period. The mean hourly pay gap is the difference in average hourly rates of pay of men 
and women. The median hourly pay gap shows the difference in the midpoints of the ranges of hourly 
pay rates for men and women. Similarly, the mean and median bonus pay gap numbers show the 
differences in average bonus pay and in the midpoints of the ranges of bonus pay between men and 
women, respectively.

As an independent investment manager we are not governed by base to bonus caps. When this fact 
is combined with our representation gap and narrower associate population in the UK, the perceived 
disparity in our numbers could be higher than other firms who are subject to such caps.

There was a 6.4% difference between the number of men and women who were paid a bonus in the 
year to 5 April 2017. This difference was due to a greater proportion females hired in the fourth quarter 
and females hired on short term contracts as of the snapshot date with these groups not being eligible 
for a bonus. When adjusting for this hire date eligibility and comparing permanent associates, there 
was no differential between the percentage of females and males receiving a bonus for the period.

As illustrated in the pay gap by quartile shown above, pay gap in the highest quartile is the key factor 
behind our overall pay gap. In the other three quartiles, the pay gap is either significantly below our 
overall pay gap or we have a negative pay gap (average pay for women is higher than the average 
pay for men).

UK GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017ADDRESSING THE GENDER PAY GAP 

What are we currently doing as a firm, and what are we planning to do, to address 
the gender pay gap? 
Diversity and inclusion is a key priority at T. Rowe Price and we already have a number of initiatives in place to help attract and retain a diverse workforce, as well as address key 
issues such as the gender pay gap. 

1.

Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is 
one of our core values 

  Our CEO Bill Stromberg has signed the Pledge for Diversity 

and Inclusion, “a CEO-driven business commitment to advance 
diversity and inclusion within the workplace.” The pledge has 
created and affirmed a shared goal among over 350 global 
companies to leverage “individual and collective voices to 
advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace.” T. Rowe Price 
continues to drive gender diversity by adhering to the pledge’s 
tenets, which include making the workplace open to complex 
and sometimes difficult conversations about diversity and 
inclusion, implementing and expanding unconscious bias 
education and sharing best practices with peer companies.

  We will continue to facilitate conversations between our female 
associates and with members of our Board and Management 
Committee to help us gain insight and understanding around 
potential barriers to progression. This helps us to collectively 
identify solutions that address these issues. 

2.

Our diversity and inclusion efforts are part 
of a long term commitment

  We regularly participate in surveys to assess our impact 

and identify opportunities to enhance our diverse and 
inclusive culture. These surveys are conducted by 
organisations such as Women in the Workplace, the 
Human Rights Campaign and the Securities Industry 
and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).

  A few highlights of our diversity include:

 – 31% of the company’s Board and 

senior leadership is female

 – 45% of the global workforce  

is female.

 – 32% of senior level new hires globally 

in 2016 were female

3.

Our leaders are accountable for meeting and 
building on diversity and inclusion objectives 

  Members of our Management Committee are executive sponsors 
for our diversity and inclusion efforts. They provide advocacy and 
strategic guidance on our diversity and inclusion initiatives.

  Each business unit has developed a diversity and inclusion plan 
that reflects specific and measurable goals to attract and retain 
diverse talent.

  Behaviours that support diversity and inclusion are embedded in 

the expectations of our leaders.

  The firm has established a Diversity and Inclusion Operating 
Council. This is a forum of senior business leaders that meets 
regularly to share best practices and monitor progress against the 
firm’s diversity and inclusion objectives. 

4.

Our associates continue to play an active 
role in our diversity and inclusion journey

  Our Business Resource Groups (BRGs), including WAVE (our 

Women’s network) and PRIDE (our network focused on LGBT+ 
matters), provide a direct connection to diverse associates and 
their allies.

  BRGs host events, provide mentoring opportunities, help inform 

policies and practices and seek ways to educate, engage and 
retain diverse talent. For example, we have developed and 
implemented a flexible work arrangements toolkit in response 
to requests from BRG members.

  Over 25% of associates are members of one or more of the BRGs, 

which are helping to facilitate the expansion of unconscious bias 
education and the sharing of best practices with peer companies.

5.

Diversity and inclusion practices are embedded 
in our talent management processes

  We have set specific goals for candidate slate diversity across 

open senior-level roles. This means that we proactively seek to interview 
and recruit from a diverse pool of candidates and has resulted is in an 
increase in the hiring of diverse talent.

  We also have a number of programs that are targeted to attracting 

diverse talent, which we will continue to build on:

 – Our London-based Apprentice Scheme, which provides school 

leavers with an opportunity to work with T. Rowe Price for a 
minimum of 12 months.

 – UK-based partnerships with various universities and organisations 

to sustain our pipeline of diverse talent.

 – Female Insight Day, which is an opportunity for young women to 

learn more about our industry.

 – The Pre-MBA internship, which is a US-based three week summer 

program for incoming diverse first year MBA students.

 – MBA day, which brings a diverse range of candidates to the firm’s 
headquarters in the US for a day and provides them with exposure 
to the investment industry, as well as career opportunities in the firm.

6.

Our compensation philosophy reflects our 
focus on inclusion

We strive to ensure that all of our associates are compensated 
fairly and equitably at the time they join and throughout their 
careers at the firm. 

Our global compensation program has the following key goals:

  Attract and retain talent.

 

Internal equity.

  External equity.

  Pay for performance.

We review the competitiveness of compensation annually, using 
internal and external data.

The data in this report reaffi  rms that we need to do more to reduce our gender pay gap, 
particularly across our investment and sales teams. We remain strongly committed to 
diversity and inclusion and have various initiatives underway across the fi rm. 

However, we recognise that there is more that we need to do to enhance our 
approach to this important topic, which is a key priority for our fi rm, including for our 
Management Committee.

Reducing the gap by identifying additional ways of attracting and retaining a talented 
and diverse workforce will help us further to provide an inclusive working environment 
for our most important asset: our Associates. This in turn will enable our associates to 
continue to do their best for our clients which is at the very core of our fi rm’s ethos.
