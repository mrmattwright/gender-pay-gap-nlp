This philosophy is core to our People Promise:   “Your difference is our strength”. Our People Promise has four pillars:   Work somewhere inclusive – Being inclusive is about giving everyone the chance to shine and contribute   in their own way. Whoever you are, we want you to feel empowered.  Work somewhere responsible - We are all about trust and teamwork. We support each other, make the most   of our strengths and encourage personal development and growth.  Work somewhere enjoyable – As a mutual we focus on building long term relationships. That’s why our   people love the teams they work in.  Work somewhere fulfilling – If you are inspired to deliver great things for customers and colleagues,   this is a place where you can make a real difference to people’s lives, including your own.   We want to live up to these promises.  It’s not only good for our people; it’s good for our customers too.  Our people   tell us our working culture is welcoming, friendly, flexible and inclusive – it’s a place where people want to be.  We have   a highly engaged workforce and our Spirit of Royal London programme supports many key diversity principles such as   inclusion, valuing the individual and their ‘strengths’ and promoting personal growth for all.  Andrew Carter, CEO of Royal London Asset   Management, who is sponsoring our Diversity & Inclusion agenda at Royal London, says “Diversity and Inclusion is a   broad subject covering everything from gender and ethnicity to disability and social exclusion.  Through the “Spirit of   Royal London” we want to ensure we have a culture that recognises people’s differences and allows them to play to their   strengths.  We’re focusing on gender as a first step from which we can broaden our work on improving diversity and   inclusion until it becomes part of our DNA at Royal London.”     Women In Finance Charter  In 2016 Royal London was amongst the first signatories to the HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter as part of our wider   focus on Diversity and Inclusion. We believe better gender diversity delivers business benefits and a positive impact on   society and the economy. We will continue to strengthen our focus on improving gender balance across the Group at every   level by supporting and developing the next generations of female leaders.  Royal London has pledged to do the following:   Set ourselves a target of increasing our female senior management population from 33% in 2016 to 40% by the end of   2020.  Publish annual reports , which outline the progress we’re making   towards meeting this target          Employers’ Network for Equality and Inclusion  We are also members of the Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion - the UK's leading employer network covering all   aspects of equality and inclusion in the workplace.  Enei awarded us a Bronze standard and are helping us in our aim to improve that to achieve best practice in equality and   inclusion in the workplace.         Gender Pay Gap  We are committed to making a lasting impact on our business by reducing our gender pay gaps; we know we have a long way   to go and that change won’t happen overnight.  Our Gender Pay Gap report shows the gaps across our business, outlines why we have these gaps and also sets out what we   are doing to address them.  By understanding the gaps we can better focus our attention on the initiatives that will make a   real difference.
