“

Diversity and inclusion are integral 
to everything we do. We are building a 
culture that is open and fair, and where 
our people feel valued and rewarded.”

Liz Nolan 
Executive Vice President, State Street, 
Europe, Middle East and Africa

A gender pay gap is the difference between the average 
earnings of men and women, irrespective of their role. 
Large employers in the UK are required to publish their 
overall mean and median gender pay gaps annually.

A gender pay gap commonly arises when an organisation 
has more men in senior-level roles and more women 
in junior-level roles. The chart below illustrates the 
percentages of male and female employees in State 
Street UK by bank title.

We know we need more women in senior roles. We have 
made some progress - but it is not enough. This is a major 
priority and focus for us.

A gender pay gap is different from equal pay, which 
concerns the rates of pay for men and women who 
are performing equal work.

We unequivocally support equal pay for work of equal 
value. We are continually working to identify and close 
pay gaps, monitor pay decisions and train our managers 
to make balanced pay awards.

Our gender pay gap results

In both State Street Bank and Trust Company and State Street Global Advisors 
Limited, the gender pay gap is largely driven by a lower representation 
of women in more senior-level and higher-paying roles.

The below tables show our mean and median gender pay gap and mean 
and median bonus gap for the period between April 2016 – April 2017, 
both as an aggregate and for our legal entities State Street Bank 
and Trust Company and State Street Global Advisors Limited.

“

We want to build an organisation where 
our workforce is as diverse as our client 
base, and where different viewpoints 
fuel innovative thinking.”

Paul Francisco 
Chief Diversity Officer

What we are doing

Developing and building a strong pipeline
We have long supported syndicated employee networks and mentorship groups 
aimed at helping women and other under-represented demographic groups to 
develop and succeed. Our Professional Women’s Network has 4,000 members 
across 26 offices globally, and focuses on supporting women with professional 
development opportunities, internal consulting assignments, mentoring, training 
and networking. Our EMEA Diversity Council sets priorities for each of our 
locations, and country managers track progress against our diversity targets.

Setting ambitious diversity goals
Our diversity goals are focused on increasing female representation by hiring, 
promoting and retaining women at all levels of the organisation. We review 
progress against our goals on an annual basis and measure them fully every 
three years. Our three year goals ending in 2017 aimed to boost the number 
of women to 43% at the AVP level, 34% at the VP and MD levels, and 28% at the 
SVP level and above. We have made substantial progress in each of these 
categories. While it is disappointing that there are areas where we did not meet 
our goals, we fell short by only a few points and are increasing our efforts.

We have recently reset our global diversity goals for 2018 to include both three 
and five-year benchmarks and further expand the scope of our efforts. We have 
set aggressive targets, including increasing female representation to 44% at the 
AVP level, 38% at the VP level, 37% at the MD level and 36% for SVP level and above.

In 2016, 45% of our hires globally were women and in 2017, 43% of our executive 
promotions (SVP level and above) were also women.

Specific to our EMEA employee base:
•   At the EVP level, our population is 37% female2  
•    Our Management Committee is more than 36% female2
•    Female representation in our broader executive ranks 
   in the region3 has increased by 6% since 20144
•    SVP level and above female representation is 22.8%

Hiring and compensation training
Our managers participate in annual training on compensation decision making, 
using tools that enable consistent, performance based pay decisions. 
Additionally, we’ve provided unconscious bias training for all managers globally. 

Eliminating the salary history question
We are implementing a policy whereby we will no longer ask current or prospective 
employees to reveal their salary history, as another way of ensuring consistent 
salaries by job level. If a person is being underpaid, basing future earnings on 
previous earnings only exacerbates the pay gap. This policy will be rolled out 
globally by the end of 2018. 

Gauging our progress

We are pleased to be included in a number of key rankings and industry initiatives:
•    We were named in The Times newspaper “Top 50 Employers for Women” 
   for the fifth consecutive year
•    Working Mother magazine recognised us as one of the “100 Best Companies” 
   for our progress in the advancement of women, work flexibility, childcare 
   and paid parental leave for the fourth time
•    We were ranked as one of the best places to work in the Human Rights
   Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year
•    We are supporters of the UK government’s Women in Finance Charter 
   and UK Diversity Project, which aims to accelerate progress towards 
   building an inclusive culture in the industry
•    We are a proud member of the UK 30% Club, which works to achieve 
   greater representation of women on FTSE-100 boards
