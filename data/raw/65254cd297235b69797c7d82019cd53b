Overview 
Our statutory gender pay gap of 5.39% 
compares favourably to the sector median pay 
gap of 10%. 
 
Analysis of the pay gap shows this is a 
product of the distribution of men and women 
within the vertical structure of the University. 
This means there are higher proportions of 
men in senior roles, with women over 
represented in lower graded administrative 
roles.  
 
The University is confident that it is paying 
equally for work of equal value, based on 
equal pay analysis carried out to support 
statutory gender reporting. 
 
A very small proportion of staff received a 
bonus, only 2.9% in the reporting period. The 
small affected population means the bonus 
gap is skewed by a small number of cases 
and reports a bonus gap of 20.0% in favour of 
women. Men and women are equally likely to 
receive a bonus.  
 
We acknowledge that we have work to do, 
and will continue to strive to reduce the 
gender pay gap at the University. We remain 
committed to ensuring all staff are rewarded 
fairly.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Introduction 
From April 2018, public, private and voluntary 
organisations with 250 or more employees will 
have to report on their gender pay gaps using 
six different measures.   
 
Mean gender pay gap  Median gender pay 

gap 
Median bonus gap 
Quartile pay bands 

Mean bonus gap 
Bonus proportions 
 
These statutory instruments, set out in the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017, build on 
existing equal pay duties and equal pay 
reporting completed within the University as 
part of the Public Sector Equality Duty.

Hourly pay 
 
The above shows a snapshot of our mean 
and median hourly gender pay gap in April

compares favourably with the sector median 
gender pay gap of 10%1 and the 18%2

Tackling the Gender Pay Gap 
We continue to take action to improve our 
gender pay position.  
 
Recently, Kingston University was awarded 
the Athena SWAN Bronze accreditation by the 
Equality Challenge Unit – recognising its work 
to advance gender equality, representation 
and progression.  
 
We have a range of family friendly policies 
which make the workplace more flexible and 
enable employees to combine work and family 
commitments effectively:  

•  Flexible working 
•  Maternity leave 
•  Parental and shared parental leave 
•  Time off for the care of dependants  
•  Compassionate leave 

 
These policies are supported by critical 
initiatives delivered by Equality, Diversity & 
Inclusion:  

•  Aurora programme 
•  Beyond Barriers Mentoring Scheme  

 
We are also reviewing the impact of our 
internal and external recruitment practices for 
their impact on the gender pay gap and 
effectiveness.  
 
We confirm the data reported is accurate:

The University’s most senior roles have a 
higher proportion of men, while women are 
over represented in junior administrative roles.  
 
Based on equal pay analysis, we are 
confident that men and women are being paid 
equally for doing equivalent jobs across the 
University.

Bonus Gap 
 
Bonus 
 
A very small proportion of staff received a 
bonus, only 2.9% in the 12 month reporting 
period. Due to the small affected group, the 
bonus gap of 20% in favour of women, is 
skewed by a small number of cases.  
 
Gender Distribution 
The gender balance of the university’s staffing 
is 54.7% female and 45.3% male, which 
aligns to the sector average of (54% female).
