In fact, everyone who has ever given me training has been more than willing to share their skills and experience.

You are given every opportunity to progress and take your career to the next level. My ROCKWOOL journey so far has definitely stretched me.”  Coral Morgan, Technical Solutions Manager  “I’ve worked at ROCKWOOL for four years, however I was a customer for fifteen years before that, in all that time I have always held ROCKWOOL in high esteem, particularly their responsible and defined purpose to create a better planet.  I feel this purpose makes me a better person and inspires me to achieve and leave a lasting impression.  Every day out in the market I feel truly honoured to be the ROCKWOOL Sales Director and am determined that we are perceived as a respectable, decent and trustworthy partner whilst achieving my sales and pricing goals, and hopefully creating the opportunity to progress my career.”  Ed Peltor, Commercial Director    “ROCKWOOL is exceptional in that it is such a friendly company and people are always willing to help each other. I also like that fact that we are part of an international group.”  Neil Maund, Supply Chain master Planner  “I had heard that ROCKWOOL is a professional company and I have really found that to be true“  Hayley Evans, Technical Consultant  “Serving an Apprenticeship at Rockwool, you are given a great education and opportunity to work with a very wide range of equipment and technologies.
