31st March 2017 
 
 
Background to the gender pay gap analyses 
 
The Gender Pay Gap Regulations (a 2017 update to the Equality Act 2010) introduced a 
requirement for listed public authorities and private sector organisations with 250 or more 
employees to publish information relating to the difference between the pay of female and male 
employees: 
 

o 

o 

o 

o 

the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and 
that of female full-pay relevant employees; 
 
the difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees 
and that of female full-pay relevant employees; 

the difference between the mean bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid 
to female relevant employees; 

the difference between the median bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid 
to female relevant employees; 

o 

the proportions of male and female relevant employees who were paid bonus pay; 

o  and the proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower, lower 

middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands. 

 

 

 

 

 

(A “relevant employee” means a person who is employed on the snapshot date; whilst a “full-
pay relevant employee” means a relevant employee who is not, during the relevant pay 
period, being paid at a reduced rate or nil as a result of the employee being on leave.) 

 
 
Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust’s workforce 
 
Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (LPT) provides mental health, learning disability, and 
community health services to the population of Leicester, Leicestershire, and Rutland (mid-year 
population estimate at June 2016: 1,069,906).  At the end of March 2017, LPT had a workforce of 
6835 relevant employees (81.6% female, 18.4% male) of which 5755 were full-pay relevant 
employees (also 81.6% female, 18.4% male). 
 
LPT’s workforce (full-pay relevant employees) encompassed a variety of job roles: Additional 
Clinical Services (25.9%), Additional Professional Scientific and Technical / Healthcare Scientists 
(2.8%), Administrative and Clerical / Estates and Ancillary (24.5%), Allied Health Professionals 
(10.2%), Medical (3.6%), Registered Nurses (33.0%); with men overrepresented in Administrative 
and Medical roles (23.4% male and 50.2% male, respectively).  Nearly half of the workforce 
worked part time (47.5%), with women more likely to work part time than men (52.5% vs 25.4%).

The levels of pay for jobs within the NHS are set according to a national agreement called the 
Agenda for Change (which applies to all except very senior managers, VSM, and medics).  
Individual jobs are assigned to an Agenda for Change pay band based on the levels of 
responsibility and expertise required, as evaluated against criteria in national job profiles.  The 
chart below illustrates the gender profile of LPT’s workforce (full-pay relevant employees) by pay 
band, for non-clinical and clinical staff.  Broadly, Administrative and Clerical, and, Estates and 
Ancillary staff are referred to as non-clinical, whilst all other groups of staff, including Nurses, 
Additional Clinical Services, and Medics, are referred to as clinical.

Broadly, there was a trend amongst non-clinical staff for the proportion of women to fall with 
increasing pay band, with especially high proportions of women at non-clinical bands 2 to 4 and a 
marked drop in the proportion of women at non-clinical band 5.  For clinical staff outside of 
medicine (largely Additional Clinical Service staff at bands 2 to 4 and Nurses at bands 5 and 
above) women were well represented at all but the two highest clinical pay bands present within 
the workforce (clinical bands 8c and 8d).

Gender Pay Gap in mean and median hourly pay 
 
 

Overall, there was a Gender Pay Gap in favour of men, both in terms of mean hourly pay, 
+16.7%, and in terms of median hourly pay, +4.0%.  The Gender Pay Gap in terms of mean 
hourly pay was larger than that in terms of median hourly pay, as the calculation of mean pay 
for men was skewed upwards by a relatively small number of men on the highest rates of 
pay in the organisation.  Nonetheless, both measures reflected a statistically significant 
Gender Pay Gap in favour of men.

Gender Pay Gap in mean and median annual bonus pay 
 
 

 

Overall, the Gender Pay Gap in annual bonus pay amongst those that received a bonus was 
+22.1% in terms of the mean and +60.0% in terms of the median, both in favour of men.  
However, very few people within the organisation received bonus pay (49 out of 6835 
relevant employees*), and the level of bonus pay varied considerably from one person to the 
next.  Consequently, the Gender Pay Gaps in mean and median bonus pay do not reflect 
statistically significant differences in the levels of bonus pay paid to men and women.

* Only Medical Consultants received bonus payments; specifically, Clinical Excellence Awards to recognise and reward 
those consultants who contribute most towards the delivery of safe and high quality care to patients and to the 
continuous improvement of NHS services.

Proportions of men and women in receipt of bonus pay 
 
 

Overall, 0.3% of female relevant employees received a bonus, whilst 2.7% of male relevant 
employees received a bonus; this represented a statistically significant difference in favour of 
men.  However, it is noted that only Medical Consultants received bonus pay (Clinical 
Excellence Awards) and that men were overrepresented amongst Medical Consultants.  
Nonetheless, even when considering Medical Consultants in isolation, there was a 
statistically significant difference in the receipt of bonus payments in favour of men: 31.3% of 
female Consultants received a bonus, whilst 54.8% of male Consultants received a bonus**.

** It is noted that not all Medical Consultants were eligible to apply for Clinical Excellence Awards, which may have 
skewed this result.  Looking at the award of Clinical Excellence Awards over the past ten years (2007 – 2017), 
application rates were lower amongst eligible female Consultants than amongst eligible male Consultants, but 
amongst those Consultants who applied, there was no significant difference in success rates by gender. 
 
 
 
Proportions of men and women within each quartile pay band 
 
 

Overall, women comprised 81.6% of full-pay relevant employees.  Women were 
underrepresented in the upper pay quartile, 75.3%, and were proportionately represented in 
the upper-middle, 85.1%, lower-middle, 82.6%, and lower, 83.4%, pay quartiles.

Summary and actions 
 
Further analyses were performed to gain greater insight into the Gender Pay Gap at Leicestershire 
Partnership NHS Trust.  In terms of the number of staff affected, the Gender Pay Gap in favour of 
men was driven mainly by those in Administrative and Clerical roles (there was also a Gender Pay 
Gap in favour of men amongst Medical Consultants, but relatively few staff were affected).  There 
was an overrepresentation of men in more senior roles in the organisation, and a higher proportion 
of women in part time roles which tended to be lower paid.  A disadvantage in career progression 
for women, potentially associated with part time working, could be inferred.  Amongst younger 
staff, who tended to be lower paid, there was a gender pay gap in favour of women in both full time 
and part time roles.  However, amongst older staff in full time roles, who tended to be higher paid, 
the gender pay gap was reversed to favour men.

Findings 

Action 

 
Review Trust flexible working policy to ensure part 
time and flexible working in senior roles can be 
supported. 
 
Encourage through job adverts that applicants can 
request job share / part time / flexible / family 
friendly working patterns as appropriate. 
 
Consider scheduling of important meetings and 
training to be held at “family friendly” times. 
 
Continue to progress the Trust programme of We 
Nurture which is a supportive career development 
programme. Evaluate numbers of applications 
coming through from part time female employees. 
 
 
Evaluate numbers of applications which have come 
through including part time employees. 
 
Consider further promotion of the scheme should 
there be a shortfall in applications. 
 
Consider eliminating whether there is any 
unconscious bias by anonymising the process. 
 

 
There was a Gender Pay Gap in favour of 
men, both in terms of mean hourly pay, 
+16.7%, and in terms of median hourly 
pay, +4.0%. 
 
 
 
 
Women were underrepresented within 
the highest pay quartile (75.3%), 
compared to their level of 
representation amongst all full-pay 
relevant employees (81.6%). 
 

 
The Gender Pay Gap in annual bonus 
pay amongst those that received a 
bonus was +22.1% in terms of the mean 
and +60.0% in terms of the median, 
both in favour of men (but not to a 
statistically significant degree). 
 
 
Overall, 0.3% of female relevant 
employees received a bonus, whilst 
2.7% of male relevant employees 
received a bonus.  Only Medical 
Consultants received bonus pay (Clinical 
Excellence Awards).  Considering 
Medical Consultants in isolation: 31.3% 
of female Consultants received a bonus, 
whilst 54.8% of male Consultants 
received a bonus.
