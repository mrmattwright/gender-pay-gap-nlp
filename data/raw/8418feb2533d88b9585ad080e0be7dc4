The purpose behind the gender pay gap report is to understand, and make public the difference between the average earnings of men and women.  The results of the ICS Umbrella Gender Pay Reporting are as follows:   Mean Gender Pay Gap – 1.64%  Median Gender Pay Gap – 0%  Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap – 43.48%  Median Bonus Gender Pay Gap – 86.2%  Proportion of males receiving a bonus – 98.4%  Proportion of females receiving a bonus – 99.9%       Quartile   Male   Female     Lower Quartile  80%  20%    Lower Middle Quartile  64%  36%    Upper Middle Quartile  64%  36%    Upper Quartile  64%  36%       Supporting Statement  ICS Umbrella is a compliant professional employment umbrella company. As an employer to UK contractors and agency workers ICS must include our employees to support Gender Pay Reporting requirements. An umbrella company when operating correctly employs its workers through multiple assignments with recruitment agencies. The employment and tax arrangements of an umbrella company see workers paid a minimum wage salary and a bonus to equate to an assignment rate set by the recruitment agency. As a result, the figures we have provided above may not support the government’s aim with this legislation. An umbrella company does not negotiate, nor is it otherwise involved in the determination of the worker’s rate of pay. All contractors and agency workers have negotiated the rate of pay with a recruitment agency directly before sourcing employment with an umbrella solution. As such pay rates vary widely by sector, skill set and experience. In 3 of the 4 quartiles we have a 2; 1 ratio to male workers, this is due to the sectors our employees work in, these include rail, construction and IT. This statement confirms that the published information is accurate as at the time of publishing.  Steve Cornwall Operations Director.
