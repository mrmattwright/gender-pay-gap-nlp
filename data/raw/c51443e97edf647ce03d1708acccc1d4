This report reflects the gender pay gap within MBA Group Ltd (MBA) from April 2016 to April 2017. It measures the difference between the average earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of their role, length of service or seniority.  MBA Gender Pay Gap  Our mean gender pay gap is 26% Our median gender pay gap is 38%  At 26%, MBA’s mean gender pay gap is higher than the UK average of 19%.  Our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue. We know that across our business, men and women are paid equally for fulfilling equivalent jobs and roles.  Our relatively high gender pay gap is related to the fact that MBA operates in traditionally “male dominated” industries such as the Information Technology (IT) and Manufacturing.  MBA Employee Gender Balance  Total number of employees = 286 Total number of male employees = 211 (74%) Total number of female employees = 75 (26%)  MBA Gender Bonus Gap  Our mean gender bonus gap is 42% Our median gender bonus gap is 68%  Proportion of employees receiving a bonus  Men: 9% Women: 3%  Our gender bonus gap is also driven by the fact we have more men than women across all areas of our business, but in particular, a much higher percentage of men in the most senior roles (86% vs 14%).  MBA Salary Quartiles       No. of Women  No. of Men  % Female  % Male    Upper quartile (high earners)  10  62  13.9%  86.1%    Upper middle quartile  12  59  16.9%  83.1%    Lower middle quartile  20  52  27.8%  72.2%    Lower quartile (low earners)  33  38  46.5%  53.5%       Fewer women than men occupy senior technical and specialist roles as a result of fewer women applying for these roles.  How will MBA improve its gender pay gap?  We know that it will take time to change the make-up of our workforce. We are committed to taking action to reduce our gender pay gap and we recognise that there is work for us to do. We will achieve this by focusing on the following areas:  Succession Planning  We are looking into ways in which a more even gender balance across senior roles can possibly be achieved as part of our business’ succession planning.  Apprenticeships  We are conscious that we operate across many “male dominated” industries and that the gender balance across the whole of our business is one of the main factors for our high gender pay gap. To counter this, we will proactively work to attract more women into our business through our apprenticeship schemes.  Learning and Development  All employees at MBA already have access to both internal and external training but we will do more to ensure that both academic and hands-on training courses feature more prominently as part of our Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programmes.  We confirm that the data in this report is accurate.
