The Nottingham Ice Centre Limited Gender Pay Report 

The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/172) require the 
Company to publish and report on our gender pay gap across a number of criteria.  

We must report annually; our first report covers the snapshot date of April 2017 so the detail relates 
to this snapshot date. 

We have published a report on our website and report to the government our organisation’s: 

•  mean gender pay gap in hourly pay 

•  median gender pay gap in hourly pay 

•  mean bonus gender pay gap 

•  median bonus gender pay gap 

•  proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment 

•  proportion of males and females in each pay quartile 

The results are visible to the public and the figures have been reached using the mechanisms that 
are set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation. 

These figures are accurate and a true reflection of the gender pay gap in our organisation. As an 
organisation we are proud of our commitment to equality, with 7 of our top 10 earners being 
women and a 50/50 split in gender amongst our senior management team.
