Park Inn by Radisson Hotels Management Ltd comprises of a number of Park Inn by Radisson Hotels, one of the eight brands, and employs over 250 employees and as such has a requirement to report its Gender Pay Gap.  Whilst the figures shown represent this area of our business, the activity and initiatives shared are reflective of the Radisson Hotel Group as a whole. As Lisa Wade, Area Director Human Resources UK & Ireland, has stated: "Park Inn by Radisson embraces equality and diversity and has for a number of years been actively working towards a more diverse and inclusive company.  As a group, we acknowledge that women are underrepresented in our senior management positions, and recognize that investing in the development of female talent is key to fulfilling our growth strategy.  In order to address this, we have invested in a number of key initiatives within the business to create a more balanced leadership, and we are already seeing improvements and results, demonstrated also by our encouraging Gender Pay figures."  Balanced Leadership  Balanced Leadership is part of our diversity drive at Radisson Hotel Group and therefore Radisson Hotels Management.  A key objective for the company is to achieve Balanced Leadership by increasing the representation of women in senior positions, breaking down barriers that prevent women from speaking openly about their careers, harnessing individual strengths of our female leaders, and retaining them through long-term career planning.  Our three key focus areas are Work/Life Balance, Mobility and a Culture Evolution; projects include a Work/Life Balance support tool, a Mobility working group to address a programme of support for those unable to move and a Balanced Leadership Health Check to ascertain how well the programme is working.  We also are pleased to share that in 2017 the Radisson Hotel Group made history by appointing the first female General Manager in the hospitality industry in Saudi Arabia.  Maram Kokandi is the General Manager of Park Inn by Radisson Madinah Road Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  Talent Review Meetings  Radisson Hotel Group and Park Inn by Radisson Hotels Management Ltd holds annual talent review meetings to reach a common understanding of the level of performance, ambitions, and the future potential of individuals, whilst also identifying successors for leadership roles.  We define clear development plans for all leaders and accelerate successor’s readiness for their next career steps.  As we enter into our 5th year of our Talent Review Meetings, we continue our commitment to our belief “We grow Talent, Talent grows us”.  An Audience with the HR Director To enhance the Talent Review Meeting process and to demonstrate the commitment to those individuals who have career aspirations and have/or are working together on a personalised development plan, the company launched “An Audience with the HR Director” in 2016.  The purpose of this initiative is to allow individuals quality one to one time with our HR Director to discuss their career aspirations, personal development plans and take advice.  By being truly engaged with the individuals journey we can actively follow up on what has been achieved in the year and provide support to ensure development plans “come to life.”   STEPS  In 2016, Radisson Hotel Group launched STEPS, a training and coaching programme developed specifically for high potential female leaders.  The programme which runs throughout the company, consists of two consecutive days of training and coaching, followed by one follow up day within three-four months.  The subjects covered within the programme include: Authenticity, Balanced Leadership, Communicate with Impact, Career Management and Total Life Balance.  In 2017, we asked all individuals from the Radisson Hotel Group who had undertaken the programme to complete a survey and were delighted with the results; 54% of those surveyed had a career advancement since the completion of the programme and 74% said they would not have made that step as easily or quickly, if they had not attended the programme.  Flexible Working  The Radisson Hotel Group and Park Inn by Radisson Hotels Management Ltd recognises the need for work life balance and will consider flexible approaches to working conditions where possible.  Supported by the activities of our Balanced Leadership Committee, we are able to share and celebrate our success stories of work life balance to encourage others in the company.  Addressing our UK Gender Pay Gap  Radisson Hotel Group and Park Inn by Radisson Hotels Management Ltd will continue to maintain and build on the initiatives and good HR practices that have been established over the years to drive down the gender pay gap.  With the recent launch of our source and hire platform, we will also have the opportunity to monitor and review our recruitment and selection processes to track and better understand the ratio of male and female applicants, with particular focus on senior positions.
