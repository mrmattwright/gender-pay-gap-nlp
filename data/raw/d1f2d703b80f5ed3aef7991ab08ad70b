We are committed to equality, and prospective employees will not be discriminated against - regardless of disability, race, gender, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, marital status or working hours.  As ever, there is more for us to do and we want to develop an integrated approach to ensure that inclusion for all, will be a sustainable philosophy for everyone who accesses our services and who work with us.  We continue to monitor our progress against our equality priorities and our Equality Delivery System action plan. We are beginning to use the refreshed Equality Delivery System 2. This will provide us with a great opportunity to further demonstrate how, as an organisation, we are not only meeting our public sector duty under the Equality Act 2010 but how far we have come in terms of eliminating discrimination and increasing inclusion to improve patient and staff experience. You can read our latest EDS2 Summary Report[pdf] 689KB for further information.   NHS Equality Delivery System (opens in a new window)  The refreshed EDS2 has arisen out of NHS England’s commitment to an inclusive NHS that is fair and accessible to all.  EDS2 is supported by the NHS Trust Development Authority. Like the original EDS, EDS2 has been designed in collaboration with the NHS and its purpose remains the same: to drive up equality performance and embed equality into mainstream NHS business.  People with disabilities We are committed to the employment and career development of disabled people. To demonstrate our commitment, we have signed up to the Disability Confident scheme (opens in a new window) , this means you are guaranteed an interview if you meet the basic conditions of the job.  Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender network Homophobia has no place in society and it definitely doesn't have a place in the modern NHS. The network not only actively supports all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender members of staff and their allies but LGBT patients.   Workforce Race Equality Standard  The NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard was developed to ensure employees from black and ethnic minority (BME) backgrounds have equal access to career opportunities and receive fair treatment in the workplace. Our    Workforce Race Equality Report (July 2017) [pdf] 580KB provides a summary of how we are doing against nine workforce indicators.

We have looked at this carefully and can confirm:   The Trust implements Agenda for Change pay rates which means that pay rates are fair and transparent.  Looking at the NHS pay bands the Trust does not have an issue in relation to equal pay.  We have a very loyal workforce and this means that many staff have reached the top of their pay band.  Where there are more females employed in a specific pay band then there is a positive comparison for female staff indicating that female staff are on higher increments than male colleagues.  The Trust has not paid any bonuses during the reporting year, 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017.  Where there is a difference (Band 9 and VSM - very senior manager), the staff groups other than doctors who have the highest salaries, reflects the fact that we employ more men than women at these grades. This is an area that we wish to address so that we have a more equal gender balance at our most senior roles.
