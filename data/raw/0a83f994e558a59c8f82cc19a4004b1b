We believe that not only is this the right thing to do, but it is vital for the success of our business.  Gender pay gap reporting is a useful tool to shine a light on whether we are doing all we can to instil gender equality within our culture and workplace.  Whilst it is clear that we still have a fair way to go, our median pay gap is almost zero (and is slightly in favour of women), which is an encouraging result and very favourable against the UK average.  We will continue to actively pursue gender equality across our business, to create a diverse and inclusive workforce.  Thomas Wilkinson , Chief Executive Officer, AXA - Global Healthcare                  Gender Pay and Bonus Gaps   Bonus gap is based on bonuses paid in the 12 months prior to 5 April 2017.                                             Proportion of men and women who received a bonus  All employees who have worked for AXA Global Healthcare (UK) Limited for more than three months, and who meet performance expectations, are eligible to participate in a bonus or incentive scheme.                   What is driving our gender pay gap?  It's not unequal pay that's driving our gap. We review the pay of all employees annually, and  frequently evaluate our pay policies to ensure we offer equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender.  Our gender pay and bonus gap is driven by:   More women than men working in lower-salaried roles,  More men than women in higher-salaried senior roles despite there being more females across the business in each quartile, and  More women than men in part time roles (which impacts the bonus gap as the figures are calculated on actual amounts paid, not the full time equivalent amounts).   What are we doing to reduce our gender pay gap?  We want to see gender equality across AXA Global Healthcare (UK) Limited and to do this we will continue to focus on opportunities to:   Identify and develop a pipeline of talented women, so they are well placed to achieve senior roles.  Promote the availability of flexible working options at all levels.   Declaration  I confirm that our data is accurate and has been calculated according to the requirements of The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
