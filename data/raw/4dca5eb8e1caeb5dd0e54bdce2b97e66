Guildford College Group is a diverse college that respects and celebrates differences in race, 
disability,  gender,  age,  gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  faith  and  religious  beliefs, 
background or personal circumstance. We want everyone to feel valued and included in the 
college community and to achieve their full potential.  The college is opposed to any form of 
discrimination and commits itself to the redress of any inequalities by taking positive action 
where appropriate.

Supporting Information  

 

Recruitment  and  Selection  -  Applicants  are  shortlisted  and  interviewed  by  recruiting 
managers  for  all  advertised  job  roles  against  the  essential  and  desirable  criteria  in  the  job 
description  and  person  specification.    All  applicants  are  asked  to  complete  an  Equal 
Opportunity  Monitoring  form  if  they  choose  to  do  so.    The  form  is  not  passed  to  recruiting 
managers at any point of the recruitment and selection process, to eliminate any unfairness 
during the process.  

Salary  and  Employee  Payments  -  The  College  implements  a  Salary  and  Employee 
Payments policy which ensures fairness when recruiting a new member of staff.  In addition 
to this the different types of roles have different pay scales to ensure a fair pay structure. 

Flexible  Working  –  As an  employer,  the  College  endeavours  to  support  where  possible  a 
number of different flexible working options whereby business operations are not adversely 
affected.  The College offer term time only for specific roles as well as compressed hours and 
job shares.
