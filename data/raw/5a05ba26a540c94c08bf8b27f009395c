Employers have to publish the gap in pay between women and men on both a median basis (pay per hour based on the person ‘in the middle’ of the distribution of pay) and a mean basis (average hourly salary).    Employers are also required to disclose the distribution of gender by pay quartile. This consists of splitting the workforce into four groups based on their pay, and showing the proportion of women and men within each group. Employers are also required to disclose percentages of employees receiving bonuses by gender and the gender gap on bonuses.    The Construction Industry, like many other industries, is affected by female underrepresentation, which is particularly prevalent at senior levels. At N&C Group, this is something we are determined to address by attracting more women to the industry and encouraging  women into senior roles.    We intend to take proactive action as a Group to support this because we believe that there is great benefit for doing this. By attracting more women to the construction industry and supporting their development, we can all realise the benefits greater diversity brings. We therefore welcome the Government’s requirement for companies to publish their gender pay gap.    Empowering new ways of thinking from a wider talent pool will help tackle the skills crisis and enable modern day businesses to rise to today’s challenges. Although the construction industry is working hard to break down many barriers and perceptions, changes need to form rapidly. At N&C, we are committed to building a more diverse workforce.
