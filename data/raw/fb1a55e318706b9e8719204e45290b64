The  Automotive  Industry  is  traditionally  a  male 
dominated  one  and  here  at  Jennings  Motor  Group 
this  is  something  that  we  are  actively  trying  to 
change.  Our  current  workforce  is  80% male  and this 
undoubtedly has a bearing on our Gender Pay Gap.                                     

 

What is a Gender Pay Gap? 

A  Gender  pay  gap  is  the  measure  of  the 
difference 
in  average  pay  of  men  and 
women  within  an  organisation  as  a  whole 
regardless  of  the  nature  of  work  they  do.  
This  is  not  to  be  confused  with  equal  pay 
which is a direct comparison of the same or 
equivalent work. 

How is it calculated? 

The results in this report have been calculated in 
line with the regulations which require us to use 
April 2017 data only to work out the mean 
(average) and median (mid-point) of hourly rates 
and quartile pay bands.

Steps we are taking to redress the 
Gender Imbalance 

Programmes in order to 
make technical and sales 
roles more attractive to 
females and have 
succeeded in recruiting our 
first female Motor Vehicle 
Technician. 

We are also reviewing our 
recruitment processes and 
the structure of our roles to 
understand what barriers 
may exist for women 
entering the industry and 
plan on increasing our 
‘Product Genius’ roles 
which have been found to 
attract more females into 
the Sales environment. 

Over the past couple of 
years we have worked hard 
to attract more females into 
the Company particularly 
into male dominated areas 
like Commercial Sales 
where we have seen an 8% 
increase in female Sales 
Executives. 

In the Car Sales side of the 
business which includes 
Internet Sales we have 
increased the number of 
female Sales Executives by 
60%. 

We are working with new 
partners to further develop 
our current Apprenticeship

Details behind the data 

In the Motor Industry April 
and September are the 
biggest months for car sales 
and hence bonus payments.    
This undoubtedly has an 
effect on the figures 
reported as the overriding 
majority of employees in 
Sales roles where bonus 
payments are higher are 
male.   

If we repeat the Gender Pay 
Gap calculations exercise 
using March data the 
 

results are very different 
and reduce the gap to 19%.  
The technical roles within 
the business i.e. Motor 
Vehicle and Body 
Technicians which are also 
bonus paid roles are 
occupied in the main by 
males.   

As a Company we recognise 
how this gap has occurred 
and this is a balance that we 
are working hard to redress 
and have already made in-
roads in.

Pay Quartiles 

The figures below show our workforce of 531 divided into 
four equal quartile pay bands.

The figures above show that our business has more males in 
senior  level  roles  which  is  also  reflected  in  the  mean  and 
median  pay  gap  figures.          This  is  indicative  of  the  Motor

   Gender Pay Gap Report (2017)                                                                   Jennings Motor Group 
 

 

Industry as historically the culture has been to promote from 
within.  Technicians work their way to Service Manager’s and 
Sales  Executives  to  Sales  Manager’s  and  so  on.    Because 
these roles have always attracted male occupants  the result 
roles.
has  meant  more  males 

in  management 

The difference in the quartiles  are  also a result of particular 
job  functions  attracting  more  females  for  example  the 
administration  roles  which  are  contained 
lower 
in  the 
quartiles are occupied by a larger number of females. 

 

Next Steps 

These  differences  in  functional  areas  are  reflective  of  our 
industry  but  something  that  we  recognise  needs  to  change 
and we are working hard to improve upon.   

As  a  Company  we  recognise  that  the  pay  gap  is  not 
something  that  can  be  eradicated  overnight  but  we  are 
working  to  change  the  stereotypical  association  attached  to 
roles within the Motor Trade.
