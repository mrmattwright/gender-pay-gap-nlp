Our Pay & Grading structure means that everyone in the team is paid equally for similar roles, regardless of gender.  Our records show that in 2017, the gender pay gap at Help for Heroes was 14.45%. While this is far lower than many other organisations, we do not believe it is good enough and are intent on improving it and closing the gap.
