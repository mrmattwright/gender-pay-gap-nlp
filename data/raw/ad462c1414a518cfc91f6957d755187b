Baxter Healthcare Ltd (UK) Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 From April 2017, all organisations that employ over 250 employees in the UK are required to report annually on their gender pay gap. This enables organisations to show the difference in average earnings between men and women in the UK and is calculated across all jobs at all levels. At Baxter, we believe in an inclusive culture and that a diverse workforce can drive innovation, create trusted partnerships with customers, suppliers and community partners, and can contribute to the success and sustainability of our company. This thinking forms the foundation of our global inclusion strategy, which is directly linked to one of the company’s aspirations to be inclusive in the way we work with all stakeholders and to commit to attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse workforce. We are committed to providing opportunities for all employees, and recognise that every individual’s unique background and experience contributes to a successful organisation. To that end Baxter welcomes the introduction of this new legislation. Our mean gender pay gap is 6.1%, which is significantly smaller than the national average of around 18%. While our numbers are good we want to close the gap. For more information,  please read our full Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 .

Dyslexia Support  Dyslexia affects 10% of the population from all walks of life and  intellectual ability. Through its initiatives, Baxter raises awareness  of dyslexia.  Through offering professional diagnosis and work place  adjustments, Baxter is able to help with those with dyslexia in the work  place.  “I was diagnosed with dyslexia while I was still at primary school at  about 8 years old.  At the age of 17 I joined Baxter working on the  machines as a supply setter, progressed to a warehouse driver and in  2013 was promoted to Senior Logistics Coordinator.   I was concerned  that my dyslexia could hold me back with the additional paperwork and  email based communication in this new role and was worried I wouldn't  achieve as well as I knew I could.  I decided that the only way forward was to ask for help. I can  honestly say Baxter and the HR department couldn't have been more  supportive.  I was given technology on my PC such as Dragon Voice  technology and a hand held spell check amongst other gadgets that could  aid me in my daily life. I completed my Chartered Management Institute  Level 3 Certificate in First Line Management.  This is a 6 month course  that I wouldn't have been able to achieve without the technology and  support offered through Baxter.”  Steve, Logistics Supervisor  Baxter believes an inclusive culture and a diverse workforce can drive innovation, create trusted partnerships with customers, suppliers and community partners, and contribute to the success and sustainability of the business. This thinking forms the foundation of Baxter's global inclusion strategy, which is directly linked to one of the company's aspirations to be inclusive in the way we work with all stakeholders and to commit to attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse workforce.  Baxter's global inclusion strategy focuses on four key areas: workforce, workplace, communities and marketplace.  Workforce Building a globally diverse organisation   Workplace Creating an inclusive culture in which diversity is valued  Communities Building partners with community-based organisations that embrace and support diverse stakeholder groups  Marketplace Creating competitive advantage by promoting Baxter’s commitment to inclusion through its brand, customers and supplier partnerships  To advance these areas, Baxter has introduced several initiatives.

These groups support Baxter's business goals and aim to enhance personal growth and multicultural understanding, while strengthening relationships among employees, customers, business partners and community partners.

In Latin America and Canada, Baxter sponsors an annual Inclusion and Diversity Week, during which time, teams from across the region participate in a variety of activities including town hall meetings, volunteer opportunities and training sessions.
