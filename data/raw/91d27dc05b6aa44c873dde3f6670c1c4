This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation: it does not involve publishing individual data. The data for 2017/18 has been compiled by Gregory King, Company Secretary and can be found below. Posted 28th March 2018. Our figures show that female workers earn slightly more than their male workers. Also, the results show that there are significantly more females, and a similar split of males and females in each quartile. The general workforce of the cleaning industry is historically largely female dominated and subject to TUPE regulations (transfer of undertakings). Under TUPE cleaning staff are transferred by law, maintaining pay rates and hours, from one cleaning provider to another when a contract is transferred or awarded.
