Make-up of Metro Bank colleagues   As at 31 December 2017  Gender diversity at every level   As at 31 December 2017  *This includes the Executive Directors and all direct reports to the CEO excluding support roles  **Senior managers are defined as those in a senior management position who report directly to a member of the Executive Leadership Team       Our 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report    Like many organisations, we have a gender pay gap and gender bonus gap. We are committed to reducing the gap, wherever possible, by encouraging and supporting more fantastic women into senior jobs at Metro Bank.          How big is our gender pay gap?   As at 5 April 2017  Why do we have a gender pay gap?  Our gender pay gap is caused by the higher proportion of men in more senior roles. We have a range of initiatives focused on encouraging and supporting talented women into leadership and specialist jobs. From our female networking group, mentoring programmes, leadership training and providing diverse candidate lists to hiring managers, to flexible working arrangements including 14 weeks parental leave for all new parents, regardless of gender.  Very importantly, we have examined the salaries for all jobs across the bank with more than ten colleagues. This has confirmed that we pay our colleagues doing the same role equitably, regardless of gender .
