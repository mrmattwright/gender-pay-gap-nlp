We are still doing just that. AbiCare offers you the full range of home care whoever and wherever you are, just as we would if you were our own family. Whether you are old, young, disabled, perfectly fit, mentally agile or fragile or whether you are the family and require respite or a holiday, AbiCare can help you. Whether you want your home cleaned, a carer to drop in and make you a cup tea once a day to keep an eye on you or your relative, or whether you want a carer to move into your house and live with you as a full time carer / personal assistant, AbiCare can do that and more! However, we always want to be challenging what is offered as good care so AbiCare now has a fabulous new offering called Abilink. Abilink harnesses the power of the internet in a very friendly way. Our Abilink users enjoy the many benefits of the internet such as shopping, television and chatting to friends or carers via video, all in absolute safety.  Abilink supplements home care though, and changes its nature…it is still home care. I started Abicare to give our clients the best possible care and I really think we do that, so let me personally welcome you to AbiCare. Anne-Marie Perry. CEO Abicare. How may we help you?
