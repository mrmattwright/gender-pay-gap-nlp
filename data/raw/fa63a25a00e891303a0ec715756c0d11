The figures will be re-analysed annually.  The gender pay gap is the difference in average hourly earnings between men and women. This is different to pay inequality, which compares the wages of men and women doing the same job or a job of equivalent value.  Our headlines:-   Our mean gender pay gap is 10.0%. Our median gap is -0.6%  The mean gender pay gap is largely because Sirona’s highest paid employees are doctors and this is the case across the NHS. If doctors are removed from the figures, our gender pay gap is -0.9%.  The median average figure shows the “typical situation” in the middle of the organisation as it removes any distortion due to very high or very low figures.  The ratio of women to men employed by Sirona is 9:1  Sirona has a female chief executive and its Senior Leadership Team at the time the data was captured comprised five women and two men,   Message from Janet Rowse, Chief Executive:  “I am immensely proud to lead Sirona and proud of every single member of staff, male and female. Within Sirona we have always said that our staff are our biggest asset and our commitment to the communities we serve is always to find the best person possible to provide the best possible care for those who need us.  “Like many health and care providers, Sirona is also an organisation with a large proportion of women employees and there are a significant number in senior roles.  “Our gender pay gap is largely because Sirona’s highest paid employees are doctors; this is the case across the NHS. Within Sirona if we remove our doctors from the figures, our gender pay gap is -0.9 per cent and is a more accurate reflection of the huge amount of work we do to ensure equality across all levels of the organisation.  “However, it is important that we are not complacent and working to reduce the gender pay gap is an important aspect of being a good employer and as part of our commitment to equality we will keep this under review.”  You can read the full report here .
