Gender Pay Gap Report  

2017 

With effect from 6 April 2017, legislation requires employers with 250 or more 
employees to publish certain statistics in relation to hourly pay and bonuses 
paid, broken down by gender.  

Gender  pay  reporting  shows  the  difference  between  earnings  for  men  and 
women as a % of men’s earnings. The figure is intended to provide a high level 
indicator  of  earning  power,  show  inequalities  in  the  market  and  to  apply 
pressure on employers to reduce any material gap. These figures are not the 
same as equal pay as gender pay reporting is impacted by the weighting of men 
and women at senior levels within a firm.

The mean hourly pay gap is the difference in the average hourly pay rate (sum 
of hourly rates divided by the number) for women compared with men across 
the organisation. 

The median hourly rate is the middle value across all hourly rates. The median 
pay gap is the difference between the median rate for women compared with 
the median rate for men. 

The calculations in this 
statement are based on a 
snapshot of hourly rates of pay 
on 5 April 2017 and bonuses 
paid in the 12 months up to  
5 April 2017.

Xafinity Consulting Limited 
Gender Pay Gap Report  

Factors affecting hourly rate pay gap 
There are a number of factors that contribute to the pay gap figures above: 

1.  Xafinity employs a range of employees including actuaries, consultants and 
administrators.  Each have different pay scales and, within each, there is no 
differentiation in pay between males and females in similar roles.  However, 
actuarial staff are predominantly male and earn materially higher salaries 
compared to other employees whether male or female.  This leads to higher 
average pay for males than females across the Xafinity employee base in 
aggregate. 

2.  The higher proportion of males than females within the actuarial profession 
is not just a Xafinity issue but is an industry wide challenge.  Maths based 
roles have for decades predominantly attracted male candidates resulting 
in a significant distortion between the number of males and females going 
into actuarial roles.  For example, around two thirds of applicants to the 
Xafinity graduate actuarial programme over the last few years were male 
regardless of gender neutral advertising.   

3.  More generally, there is also an imbalance of women in senior positions at 

Xafinity.  As a result, we have more men in higher paid roles. 

Xafinity has a number of initiatives to address its gender pay gap over the next 
few  years  including  enhancements  to  policies  in  relation  to  maternity  pay, 
mentoring programmes for newly qualified female actuaries, greater emphasis 
on agile working and the introduction of a formal job grading programme to 
ensure no gender bias regarding career development at Xafinity.  
Hourly Pay Quartiles  
The hourly pay quartiles split the employees into equal quarters and show the 
proportions of men and women in four pay bands. All men and women’s hourly 
pay rates are ranked from the lowest to the highest to create four equal bands.

Gender Bonus Gap 
Regulations also require publication of the proportion of men and women paid 
bonuses in the preceding 12 months, together with the ‘bonus gap’ statistics in 
relation  to  these  bonuses.    These  results  are  similarly  impacted  by  the 
imbalance in the number of male and female actuaries, and in senior roles more 
generally, who have a higher level of variable pay.

Ben Bramhall, Co-Chief Executive Officer said:  
Following detailed analysis of our gender pay gap, we are satisfied there is no 
material  difference  between  the  pay  for  men  and  women  in  similar  roles  at 
Xafinity.  Our gender pay gap reflects a higher proportion of males in higher paid 
roles than females. Whilst this is partly a challenge of the industry in which we 
operate – in particular, the actuarial profession is dominated by males – we do 
not consider this level of distortion to be acceptable.  We believe that we have 
a  responsibility  to  enact  change  both  within  Xafinity  and  the  industry  more 
generally.   
We  have  a  number  of  initiatives  in  place  to  improve  the  diversity  of  our 
workforce  at  all  levels,  and  specifically  to  increase  the  number  of  females  in 
senior  positions,  which  we  believe  will  greatly  benefit  the  business.    Some 
examples of the initiatives already being undertaken, or planned, are below: 

In  2016,  we  introduced  variable  working  patterns  to  enable  staff  to  better 
manage their commitments outside of work. 

We are improving our maternity pay policy to encourage female employees to 
pursue  a  long  term  career  with  the  firm.  We  operate  a  ‘return  to  work’ 
arrangement where people managers liaise with those going on maternity leave 
to ensure they are aware of the flexibility around returning to work. 

We run an Actuarial Mentoring Programme for newly qualified female actuaries 
in  conjunction  with  Women  Ahead,  the  aim  of  this  programme  is  to  retain 
female  actuaries  within  the  profession  through  ongoing  career  advice  and 
support.  We also run an internal mentoring programme for newly and nearly 
qualified female actuaries. 

We will launch a “returning women campaign” where we specifically look to 
recruit women who have left financial services or taken a career break and are 
looking to return to work.   

We will trial gender balanced shortlists for certain roles so that we have an equal 
share of men and women to interview.  

We will generate and sponsor a network of senior females within the industry 
to identify how our industry can address the gap collectively.  

These new initiatives will be introduced progressively over the next 12 months.  

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
