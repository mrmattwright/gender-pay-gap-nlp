It demonstrates our commitment to equality and dignity, and our respect for human rights. This policy document draws together:   A statement of our commitment to equality   Details of the legal requirements  A description of Herefordshire's population in terms of its diversity   The expectations that we have of our staff and elected members in terms of organisational values, culture and behaviour   The document also details the six key equality principles to which we will adhere. We believe using these principles as a focus will give the people of Herefordshire equitable access to our services, and to working for us.  Our six key equality principles   Promote our values and acceptable standards of behaviour for members and employees  Make fair and equitable decisions  Recruit fairly and support our workforce  Make our services accessible  Understand the needs of the community that we serve  Provide tailored support to vulnerable groups   How we meet our statutory duties  General duty  By law we have to show due regard for equality and diversity when we make decisions. That's why we assess the potential impact to any changes we make to our services.  We consider the impact on the needs and rights of people according to their 'protected characteristics'.  Whenever we make a decision about a public function or policy, we engage with these groups, look at equality information and put together an equality analysis. This helps us to comply with equality law, foster good community relations, and tackle any negative effects or discrimination.  If we find that a policy has adverse effects which are not justified and can't be reduced, we will stop the policy in question.  Publishing information  You can download an equality analysis of our workforce and our councillors . We have also published a document detailing the work of the equality team (and its associated teams) to indicate the nature and scope of the work undertaken.  Setting equality objectives  Our equality objectives are incorporated into our equality policy and are reviewed annually. Download the 2018 review .  Gender pay gap reporting  As a result of the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, all public sector employers (with 250 or more employees) are required to publish information about the difference between pay for male and female employees by 30 March 2018. This is called the gender pay gap. The figures used are based on a snapshot of the data on 31 March 2017. The current gender pay gap for Herefordshire Council is 15.4 percent, and detailed statistics can be found within the equality analysis of our workforce .
