Gender Pay Gap Report 
2017

Our analysis also shows a 
6% pay gap between the 
median salary of our female 
and male employees (April 
2017). 
 
This is the difference 
between women’s 
median hourly wage (the 
middle paid woman when 
all female employees are 
ranked from highest to 
lowest paid) and men’s
median hourly wage (the 
middle paid man when all 
male employees are ranked 
from highest to lowest paid).

Our analysis shows a 5% 
pay gap between the mean 
salary of our male and 
female employees (April 
2017). This is the 
difference in average 
hourly pay between men 
and women across the 
entire organisation as 
opposed to a like-for-like 
pay gap for employees 
working in the same job. We 
have a higher proportion of 
women under 25 working in 
advisory roles which largely 
affects this figure.
 
Echo-U has a progressive 
culture for the training and 
development of all 
employees, so naturally as 
any team members rise up 
through the business their 
earnings will increase. 

Over 80% of our 
management team started 
with us as customer service 
advisors.

This is down to a higher 
propensity of females 
working in team leader 
roles.

Since April 2017 we have
continued to progress the 
gender equality agenda, 
and have created a number 
of new senior level positions 
in the business. We now 
have a significant level of 
female managers and 
directors in the organisation, 
with 60% of our directors 
now female and 29% of 
our senior leadership team 
female.

We will continue to 
champion a
people-friendly culture and 
take action where needed to 
address any pay gaps within 
our commitment to equality 
and diversity in our 
organisation.
