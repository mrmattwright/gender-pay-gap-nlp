January 2018 

As an employer of more than 250 staff, MacIntyre 
has undertaken Gender Pay Gap Reporting as 
required by the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017.  
 
The gender pay gap in an organisation is a measure 
of the difference between the average earnings for 
men and women, irrespective of the position, over a 
standard period of time. This is different from equal 
pay where companies are required to ensure that 
men and women are paid the same for doing the 
same or similar roles.  
 
At MacIntyre our workforce is predominantly female, 
with women making up 75% of our staff, which is 
reflective of the social care sector. We are confident, 
due to our job evaluation process and salary 
bandings, men and women are paid equally for the  
same or similar roles. 
 
The data below is relevant as of 5 April 2017.

included in the gender pay gap reporting for bonuses.

Conclusion 
 
MacIntyre is committed to positively promoting equality of opportunity, eliminating 
discrimination and encouraging diversity amongst the workforce. Our aim is that our 
workforce will be truly representative of all sections of society and each employee feels 
respected and able to give their best. 
 
We are committed to recruit from the widest possible pool of potential talent without any 
restriction so that we can best match applicants to the needs of the people we support. The 
recruitment process for every vacancy will be non-discriminatory in every aspect. 
 
As highlighted above there is an under-representation of males in all divisions within the 
organisation which is one of the main reasons for our mean gender pay gap. MacIntyre 
endeavors to pay all our staff above the National Living Wage rate and operates a Job 
Evaluation Guardianship Scheme to review all roles in relation to the job description and pay 
in comparison to other roles within the organisation.
