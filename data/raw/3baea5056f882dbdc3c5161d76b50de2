There is no doubt our success is a result of the hard work each individual employee has contributed.  Today we employ 22,000 people and are renowned for industry-leading pay, having been the first supermarket to introduce the Living Wage Foundations recommended Living Wage.  All of our employees receive equal pay rates and our gender pay gap is well below the UK average. However, there is more we need to do and I am personally heading up a taskforce dedicated to finding ways of closing our gender pay gap. I am proud of our track record so far and am confident we will achieve this in time.  I confirm that the information and data provided is accurate and in line with mandatory requirements for businesses in England, Scotland and Wales.  Nan Gibson, Board Director of Human Resources, ‎Lidl UK               Lidl as an employer  Lidl UK employs over 22,000 people across England, Scotland and Wales. We take great pride in being a fair and responsible employer and are committed to ensuring every member of our workforce has the same opportunities to progress.  Our pay structure is simple: pay is based on the role an individual holds within the business, and their length of service.  We have a track record of paying employees fairly and are currently one of the highest paying supermarkets in the UK.          In 2015 Lidl UK became the first British supermarket to pay the real Living Wage and we have pledged to match this every year since. In November 2017 we announced our latest increase in wages, benefitting more than 16,000 employees. As of March 2018, entry-level wages have risen from £8.45 to £8.75 per hour outside of London and £9.75 to £10.20 within the M25.  We’re an award winning graduate employer too, with The Times naming us in the top 15 of its Top 100 Graduate Employers list. Our Area Manager starting salary is £46,893 and our employees are supported through bespoke training programmes as they progress in their career at Lidl.  We believe it’s important to say thank you to our employees for all their hard work. As an example of this, in 2018 we invested £10m in staff benefits, give all our employees an in-store discount, and our ‘Team Lidl Rewards’ gives access to discounts with selected brands across the UK. These are just some of the benefits our employees receive as standard when they work at Lidl.           Lidl Gender Pay Gap  As per the Equality Act (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, Lidl UK has analysed pay for all employees in England, Scotland and Wales, and disclosed differences between men and women.  It is important to be clear about what is being reported. Measuring the ‘gender pay gap’ is different to measuring whether a company pays ‘equal pay’.  As at 31.03.17, we identified a mean pay gap of 10.9 per cent and a median pay gap of 3.0 per cent. This compares to the UK national average of 17.4 per cent mean and 18.4 per cent median.                       Our pay gap is attributable to a greater proportion of men than women in the business, particularly in the upper-quartile.              Bonus pay  We do not award performance related bonuses.  Any bonuses paid relate to anniversary payments which are awarded at key loyalty milestones (e.g. when an employee has worked for the company for 10 years).  An equal amount of male (3.1 per cent) and female (3.1 per cent) employees received a bonus during the reporting period.  The mean bonus gap was 33.3 per cent and the median gap was 43 per cent. This is attributable to more males having served the business for a longer time-period and so qualifying for relevant key service milestone bonuses.      Reducing the gap  We are committed to reducing the gender pay gap going forward and we are already taking steps to address this, by working to attract more women into the business.  Last year we launched a dedicated programme called ‘Women in Lidl’, which brings together a taskforce of female representatives from across the business, with the objective of exploring opportunities to further encourage attraction, retention, progression and support of women.  We are introducing a competitive maternity package to strengthen female retention. And we also offer flexible contracts to employees to help support better work-life balance for individuals with family commitments.  We remain committed to finding new ways to promote better gender parity within our business across all levels.
