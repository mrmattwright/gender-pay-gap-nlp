IMI plc
UK Gender Pay Report 2017

In April 2017 the UK government introduced Gender Pay 
Gap regulations which required companies with 250 or more 
employees to publish the difference in pay for men and 
women across the UK organisation. UK employees represent 
only 12% of IMI’s global workforce, meaning the vast majority 
of global employees are not covered by these regulations.

The gender pay gap differs from equal pay, which reflects 
the pay differences between men and women who carry out 
the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. Across 
IMI we are confident that men and women are paid equally 
for doing equivalent jobs. Our commitment to equal pay is 
reinforced by our fair and inclusive recruitment policies and a 
robust pay structure that utilises grades/bands and external 
benchmarking to set pay.

Having a broad talent pool provides IMI with an optimal mix 
of experience, skills and ideas. We are committed to ensuring 
we continue to recruit, retain and develop a diverse and 
talented global workforce.

The Gender Pay Gap regulations require  
IMI to report:

»  The difference in mean and median pay between 

men and women calculated on the basis of 
equivalent hourly pay rates (Hourly pay gap);

»  The differences in mean and median bonus pay 

between men and women (Bonus pay gap);

»  The proportion of men and women receiving 
bonus pay in a year (Bonus receipt gap); and

»  The distribution of men and women between 

pay band quartiles, calculated using the range 
of hourly pay rates (Gender and pay quartile 
distribution).

IMI Gender pay  
gap results
IMI’s Gender Pay results 
are calculated for 1,021 
employees, working for eight 
IMI companies in the UK. 
Although we are only required 
to report figures for one of our 
legal entities, Norgren Ltd, we 
have voluntarily disclosed our 
gender pay gap across the 
whole UK organisation. We 
feel this is important to better 
understand our gender pay 
gap at a UK-wide level, the 
reasons for it and in keeping 
with our commitment to 
transparency.

Analysing IMI’s gender pay gap

How we are addressing the gap

There is a 73% male, 27% female gender 
distribution in the UK organisation, which is typical 
of the Engineering sector in which we operate. We 
recognise that our results are borne from women 
being under-represented in technical and senior 
functional roles across our business and across the 
Engineering sector more generally. It should also 
be noted that IMI’s executive level management 
including our most senior functional, technical and 
engineering roles are in many cases based within 
our UK headquarters location.

Like many Engineering companies, IMI has to work 
hard to recruit as many women as men into technical 
roles, which are typically higher paid roles. Currently, 
only 15%1 of engineering graduates, and less than 
10%1 of all engineering professionals are women 
which limits the supply of female technical talent.

IMI has a clear Diversity and Inclusion policy that 
stresses the need to recruit and retain best in class 
talent that fully represents each of the geographies 
and markets in which we operate.  Fundamental 
to that policy is building a workplace that is 
demonstrably inclusive and where employees feel 
they can develop and give their best.

We are addressing our gender pay gap by building 
on our existing diversity and inclusion practices. 
Each Divisional IMI Executive team now has specific 
personal objectives relating to diversity that are 
relevant and specific to their businesses. IMI has 
a truly global approach to addressing diversity 
issues and has introduced a number of best in class 
initiatives, including identifying diverse sources of 
top talent in the markets in which we operate, to 
expand our talent pool and candidate reach during 
recruitment.

Additionally, our remuneration policies are designed 
to support gender diversity through flexible working 
practices and HR policies that support a balance of 
work and family life for men and women. 

Attracting and retaining a diverse and talented 
workforce is fundamental to the success of our 
business. We are committed to supporting the drive 
for equality and positive change across the industry 
and intend to monitor and seek to drive realistic and 
sustainable improvement in our performance against 
both gender pay gap regulations and more generally 
our Diversity and Inclusion policy. 

We confirm that the data reported is accurate.
