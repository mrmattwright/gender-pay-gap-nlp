Gender Balance & Pay ReportAs of 5 April 2017Enacting change today

Since establishing Alexander Mann Solutions over 20 years ago, the leadership team and I have strived to create a 
transparent, flexible, diverse and inclusive work environment, enabling all of our colleagues to succeed personally and 
professionally. Regardless of gender identity, we are passionate about  equally recognising our exceptional talent. Our 
difference really is our people – they are the foundation of our success.

With over 1,600 colleagues in the UK, our Alexander Mann Solutions global family now exceeds over 4,000 individuals 
who support 100+ blue chip organisations operating in over 90 countries in 40 languages. 70% of our population is 
female (66% in the UK) and we have over 40% female representation on our global leadership team. Our employees, 
clients and candidates are globally diverse and as such we invest our energy in attracting, developing and retaining 
the best talent to reflect the communities we operate in. We place flexible working at the heart of our global business 
strategy, encouraging all colleagues to understand and consider the various flexible working options we proactively 
offer.

Our values of Passionate, Authentic, Distinctive and Brave drive our behaviours and guide us to realise our full 
potential. Via our anonymous quarterly ‘Pulse Point’ surveys, we’re delighted that the overwhelming majority of 
colleagues tell us that they can be their authentic self at Alexander Mann Solutions and affirm that flexible working 
truly is our default position.

Our pay philosophy and policy supports equal pay at Alexander Mann Solutions. We have clear salary bandings that 
are reviewed annually and benchmarked against global external data. Bonus and incentive schemes are open to all.

We have a greater representation of females in almost all levels of our organisation in the UK and are close to parity 
at Director level. Our gender pay gap analysis tells us we have more work to do for both females and males. The data 
reveals that we have a greater proportion of males in more senior roles and a higher proportion of females in more 
junior roles.   

This report provides you with our headline data. It captures the many working practices we already have in place to 
promote our inclusive environment and features some of our colleagues sharing their personal experiences of flexible 
working. We also outline what further steps we are taking  to address gender balance at Alexander Mann Solutions, at 
our clients and industry-wide as I firmly believe we must change our practices as a collective to have a greater impact 
on society overall.

Equal pay vs gender pay

Equal pay is a measure of whether males and females are paid equally for the same work or 
work of equal value.  Alexander Mann Solutions adheres to equal pay policies and our data 
confirms that we do not have an equal pay gap. 

Gender pay, as defined by recent legislation, is distinct from equal pay as it is not measuring 
parity of pay for roles of the same level. Instead it compares the average pay by gender for all 
roles collectively regardless of level or type.

Despite its name the gender pay gap is more a measure of gender balance than remuneration.  
Its aim is to raise awareness of representation at all levels and encourage employers to take the 
steps to ensure gender balance.

What the data tells us
Mean gender pay

Why do we have a gender pay gap?
Our data reveals that we must do more to strive for gender balance. For us, it is clearly about career progression and 
not equal pay. 
In summary, our challenge is that there are proportionally fewer females than males in senior roles and a higher 
proportion of women in more junior roles relative to males. This is more pronounced at Manager and above as 36% of 
the total male population is represented here versus 28% (see chart above) of our female population. Conversely 41% 
of our total female population is at specialist level and below as opposed to 34% of our male population.
If the number of females at every level of the organisation reflected the proportion of females overall the gender pay 
gap would be reduced to -1.14% (see equal weighting chart).

Why do we have a gender bonus gap?

Our bonus and incentive approach provides everyone with an equal opportunity to earn additional rewards. Our 
analysis reinforces this by revealing that 74% of eligible males  and 77% of eligible females  received a bonus. 
Overall we have a higher mean and median bonus gap than our mean and median pay gap. 

This can be explained by two key factors: 
•  Our bonus percentages range from 5% up to 30% based on seniority of role and as we have a higher proportion of 

• 

men in senior roles versus females this compounds the difference
12% of our population work on a part time basis and 94% of these are women.  Part time colleagues receive 
prorated bonus payments to reflect these reduced hours.  The bonus pay gap methodology does not take into 
account the part time working

If the number of females at every level of the organisation reflected the proportion of females overall the gender 
bonus gap would be reduced to 4.90% (see equal weighting chart).

Progressing gender balance

Our assignment based culture coupled with our strong internal mobility 
strategy enabling both local and international moves accelerates our 
employees development and fuels retention. Quality career conversations – 
helping our male and female colleagues pursue passions and interests inside 
the organisation through our engagement forums, projects and assignments 
have become even more important as they reach more senior levels.
Flexible working – a reality
Over three years ago, Alexander Mann Solutions set a business objective that 
“all roles can flex in some way” so that we can offer meaningful opportunities 
to all our employees and recruit a more diverse and wider pool of talent. A 
global development programme was launched to increase the take-up and 
consistency of flexible working. Our people and our managers were educated 
on its benefits. Collaborative technology platforms were deployed to provide 
our employees with the tools to work flexibly and remotely and enable 
varying work patterns across our international operations.

We have a multitude of working practices to support an agile workforce 
including: policies and templates, leading remote teams training sessions, a 
virtual learning management system and local champions, to name a few.

In 2017, Alexander Mann Solutions won Working Families Best Flexible 
Working Initiative. A key differentiator was our passionate promoters at 
all levels sharing the benefits of working flexibly and offering candid and 
valuable advice to their colleagues.

Diversity and Inclusion
At Alexander Mann Solutions, our talented people are what makes a 
difference and it’s their difference that makes us distinctive. We believe in real 
inclusion where individuals can bring the best version of themselves to work 
to achieve success, drive innovation and promote a high performance culture.

Our Diversity & Inclusion Board formed in 2016 and some of the steps we’ve 
taken since then include:-

• 
• 

• 

• 

Established regional D&I ambassadors & committees
Conducted “Introduction to Diversity, Inclusion and Unconscious Bias” 
training with a large portfolio of onsite teams & “Unconscious Bias and 
Cultural Intelligence” training with our Leadership team
Launched employee network groups for LGBTQ+ and Health and 
Wellbeing
Partnered with the Armed Forces to support Recruitment for Spouses 
including specialist training in Sourcing

Our total reward strategy
Compensation (ie base pay and bonus) is just one feature of our total rewards 
scheme. Other benefits include protecting our employees’ health and long 
term financial security, improving skills and career advancement, and work-
life offerings such as flexible working. In our 2017 annual pulse survey, our 
people rated Flexible Working as the most competitive component of their 
total rewards package.

So what more can we do? 
Our steps to closing the gap

Our existing and long term people strategy is all about 
developing our inclusive and collaborate culture for all 
our employees. The findings in the report allow us to 
articulate the specific actions which will directly impact 
gender inclusion and female career progression in our 
business.

Next generation of female 
leaders
In addition to nurturing our senior high potentials 
across Alexander Mann Solutions, we must also 
identify and accelerate the development of our 
female emerging talent. We will delve deeper into the 
organisation and tailor specific interventions targeted 
to their development. We will also launch a mentoring 
programme with gender inclusive champions – our 
male colleagues who enable women to succeed at all 
levels of the business. 

Address the gender imbalance 
amongst part time workers
Whilst continuing to promote a culture of 
empowerment, trust and fairness in our approach to 
flexible working, we want to encourage more males to 
benefit from flexible working. Today only 7% of our UK 
part time workers are male. We need to understand if 
there are barriers stopping more men from working part 
time and if so what they are. Whilst we have a number 
of roles which are job shares, we’re striving for our first 
male, female job share. We want to also reset norms and 
provide equal opportunities for all.

Best in class return to work 
proposition
External benchmarks cite 66% of returners come back 
to roles below their potential. We are targeting 100% of 
our returners to work at their career potential. A recent 
internal survey revealed that if we focus on pre-, during- 
and post-leave phases, we will have a significant impact 
on how easily returners at Alexander Mann Solutions 
reintegrate, feel enriched and experience balance. 
Specific actions we will explore include the launch of 
a buddy system, a parents network, re-induction and 
enhanced benefits for our employees to access products 
and services including back up child care and parental 
leave toolkits.

Eliminate bias & attract more 
women in senior roles
We will initiate a pilot to use robotics to test removing 
bias in our candidate shortlists both for our employees 
and for our clients. 
We will specifically pipeline more senior women as well 
as tapping into the rich external talent who are looking 
to return to work for manager and above roles.

Lead the way
As trusted advisers in talent management and talent 
acquisition, we also want to influence our client base. 
By sharing our successes and experience, we hope to 
change the way some embrace gender balance as well 
as learn from those that are leading the way.

We also commit to lead an industry wide working 
party to review how we can change our practices as a 
collective and have a greater impact on society overall. 
We see it as our responsibility to make a difference 
within and beyond Alexander Mann Solutions.

“Our job-share partnership has successfully spanned 10 years, two 
companies, and four roles. It has allowed us to focus on our careers, but 
also to switch off and focus on our families, secure in the knowledge that 
our work is in very safe hands.  We both get out of it what we put in, and 
sometimes that’s involved going over and above, but it’s a trade we’re both 
very happy to make as a means to continuing our arrangement. It’s been a 
very strong “marriage” so far, and one we’re sure will go the distance. We 
wouldn’t have it any other way”.

“One of the great things about Alexander Mann Solutions is the flexibility we 
offer our team members to organise their personal and professional lives 
in a manner that recognises their personal ambitions and priorities. Since 
2016 I have been working four days a week for Alexander Mann Solutions, 
giving me the flexibility to incorporate other activities that I am passionate 
about into my working week. Alongside running the Talent Collective, I now 
also have the time to chair a charity, advise a number of small businesses 
on their growth strategy and provide career counselling to students in a 
number of local schools”.

Flexible Working

“What I love about Alexander Mann Solutions is that it provides me with a rich 
and rewarding career at a leadership level yet also offers me the flexibility 
of a work life balance to fulfil personal commitments outside of the office. I 
initially started working flexibly due to family responsibilities 12 years ago and 
have continued to do so as it provides me with the best of both worlds. As the 
business has grown, my role has also grown in size and geographical coverage 
and Alexander Mann Solutions has continued to fully support my career with 
flexible and creative job design opportunities. I now share the leadership 
of our global consulting services business with a partner who is also a 
successful female leader from business . Our different backgrounds but highly 
complementary skills underpin a perfect partnership allowing us to work very 
closely to drive the vision and delivery of the business whilst continuing to 
benefit from the individual balance in our personal lives”.  - Laurie

Job Share

“Flexible working within my team has enabled us to meet employees 
requirements based on their personal circumstances and background.
With a team size of 80+ between Belfast and Bracknell, if people want to 
work different schedules, starting and finishing at different times, we have 
a wider coverage of business hours and the opportunity to speak with 
potential candidates either before or after they are at work. 
 This has been a huge positive for us and great to see team cohesion and 
collaboration enhanced as staff negotiate work allocations amongst 
themselves. I feel this has improved staff engagement and motivation. 
 For me personally, since returning to work from maternity leave, having the 
ability to work flexibly has improved my work-life balance, health, wellbeing 
and most important to me, allowed me to work around my child’s needs”.
