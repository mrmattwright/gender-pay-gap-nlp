Message from Carol Muldoon

vp Partner Resources, Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa

At Starbucks, we have a proud history of celebrating inclusivity and diversity in our workforce of 

employees (who we call partners, as we all have shares in the business). As part of the Gender 

Pay Gap legislation, under the Equality Act 2010, we are required to publish specific criteria 

looking at gender pay across the more than 5,000 partners employed by Starbucks UK Ltd.

For the purposes of this report our gender pay gap is calculated using the approach required 

by the regulations, which compares the pay of males and females. We are encouraged that our 

figures show that when looking at our UK partners there is a 0% median pay gap between men 

and women, and a 6 per cent mean pay gap. We also have a fairly even proportion of men and 

women across the levels of our business – with slightly more women represented in the top 

quartile (62 per cent). 

We recognise where we can do more, including bringing more women up to top senior 

positions, to reduce bonus pay disparity. We will also continue open discussion on this subject 

across our partner teams, holding ourselves accountable and ensuring we break down the 

barriers that prevent anyone fulfilling their potential, regardless of gender.

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017What is gender pay  
gap reporting?

UK gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more 
employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the 
pay gap is between their male and female employees.

There are six calculations:

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
6 

Mean gender pay gap (this 
number is the average)

Median gender pay gap 
(halfway point between the 
highest and lowest pay)

Mean bonus gender 
pay gap

Median bonus gender 
pay gap

Proportion of males 
receiving a bonus payment 
and proportion of females 
receiving a bonus payment

Proportion of males and 
females when divided into 
four groups ordered from 
lowest to highest pay

Understanding mean and 
median gender pay gap:

The mean gender pay gap 
shows the percentage 
difference in average pay 
between men and women 
across the business.

The median gender pay gap 
is the percentage difference 
when we compare the middle 
point of all female partner 
salaries in our business and all 
male partner salaries. 

The proportion of men and 
women awarded any bonus 
pay over the same 12 month 
period is also reported.

Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay - Equal pay deals with the pay 
differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs 
or work of equal value. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average 
pay between all men and women in a workforce.

Our results and what 
they mean

Additional  
support

We have a low mean and median gender pay gap amongst our 

We are constantly working to make Starbucks a 

UK partners – at 6% and 0% respectively. In April 2017 the gender 

great place to work, and that includes creating a 

pay gap (for median earnings) for full-time employees is at 9.1% 

framework for an inclusive and diverse workforce. 

(ONS data), so we come in lower than this national average.

We will continue to update on our progress and 

policies to support this.

35%

At all four salaried levels of 

our business, we have a higher 

proportion of women at around 

65% women - 35% male.

65%

There is a larger gap when we look at the average bonus gap – 

22% mean average and 33% median average. This gap is driven 

by the fact that there are fewer female partners in the most senior 

roles, and we are working to encourage and develop talented 

women throughout our organisation.
