Cripps 

Gender pay gap report 2017

We are committed to inclusion 
and diversity and welcome the 
new Gender Pay Gap Reporting 
Regulations as another step in 
progressing societal and working 
norms.  We have rigorous 
processes in place to review, 
benchmark and ensure that we 
pay our people fairly for the work 
they do.

Our gender pay gap figures 
reflect the gender make up of our 
employees, with 35% of our 
people being women in support 
or administrative roles. Our 
location close to London and how 
we operate as a professional 
services business is also  
reflected in our pay gap figures.

We are committed to working to 
reduce gender pay gaps that 
exist and to our strategy to offer 
opportunities to work at Cripps.

Improving our gender imbalance

• Regular employee engagement surveys, 

formal and informal feedback 
mechanisms and an actively used 
employee suggestion scheme

• Ongoing reviews of how our initiatives 
are working and considering what we 
can do better

At Cripps we are passionate about 
our people and strive to employ, 
develop and retain the best. Our aim 
is to reduce our gender pay gap year 
on year.

We have already implemented a 
number of initiatives to foster positive 
changes and have others that we 
have plans to implement. 
These include:

• Opportunities for career 

development for all,  which has 
resulted in an increase in the 
number of female promotions year 
on year

• Alternative routes for career 
progression to recognise the 
diverse working needs of our 
people

• Flexible working opportunities for 

all

• Encouraging and developing agile 

working practices including 
investing in ICT systems to support 
these practices

• An internal forum which reviews 

and pilots different ways of 
working throughout Cripps, 
focussing on opportunities and 
initiatives for agile working, career 
progression, mentoring and 
networking for all of our people
