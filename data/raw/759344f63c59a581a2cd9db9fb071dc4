The following narrative describes the gender pay gap from the group using the snapshot date of the 5th April 2017 as per the reporting regulations. It is important to note that the gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay for equal work.  Our People Values At Andrew Brownsword Hotels we believe that every individual in our business can learn, develop and progress and are committed to a diverse workforce and gender equality. Our commitment to building a diverse workforce starts at the top of our business with our Board being a 50/50 male/female split and with a female CEO. We are committed to promoting from within and have numerous examples of progression throughout the business for all employee groups. We have a open and fair approach to recruitment and remuneration which is based on job role and locality, skill level and experience and is applied equally to all employee groups. We are currently expanding our development and training pathway which will be available equally to all employee groups. Group Management Structure Board of Directors                Senior Management Team                Mean & Median Gender Pay Gap Women's mean hourly rate is 4.1% lower than men's In other words when comparing mean hourly rates, women earn 96p for every £1 that men earn. Women's median hourly rate is 0.7% higher than men's In other words when comparing median hourly rates, women earn £1.01 for every £1 that men earn. We recognise and are pleased that our positive practices and culture toward a diverse workforce is reflected in the results reported on our mean and median pay gap which are significantly better than the national average for the accommodation and food sector. We also however  recognise that we have opportunity to improve these further and will continue to review and develop all of our people practices, training and development and remuneration policies to do so. Quartile Pay Gap                Our quartiles have a fairly even distribution with a similar percentage of women in the Top Quartile (Highest Paid) and Lower Quartile (Lowest Paid). We would hope to see more females progressing from the Lower Middle to the Upper Middle and Top Quartile in the coming years to help even these out further. Bonus Pay Gap Who received a bonus? 5.3% of women 4.6% of men Difference in bonus pay Women's mean bonus pay is 95.8% lower than men's Women's median bonus pay is 97.2% lower than men's The vast majority of our team are remunerated as salary and not on a bonus basis. We have three group wide schemes which are: A General Manager bonus scheme based purely on measured property performance annually. A recommend a friend recruitment scheme. Spa product sales incentive. All of these schemes are available and measured equally to all in these employee groups. The results are skewed because they reflect the percentage of male General Managers achieving bonus payments at a senior level against the smaller commissions paid for spa sales or the recommend a friend bonus. Bonus schemes are reviewed annually and we will continue to ensure that they are available and measured equally to both males and females in the most appropriate way possible. We will continue to encourage female progression to General Management level.
