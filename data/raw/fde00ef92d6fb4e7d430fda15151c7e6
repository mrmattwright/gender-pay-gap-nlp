The above table shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap at the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.

Women make up a smaller percentage of the workforce, which is normal in the warehousing and distribution industry. 
However the gap in hourly pay shows that our average gap is less than the national average.
Women feature largely in the mid-bands of pay for PJH, which is demonstrated by the negative median hourly pay gap.

The above charts illustrate the gender distribution across P.J.H. Group Limited in four equally sized quartiles.

The data shows a greater proportion of males in the lower quartile with females represented more evenly across the 
higher three quartiles.

Where men and women occupy equivalent jobs across the business, we are confident that they are rewarded equally via 
our employee bandings.

We confirm that the data reported is accurate.
