Gender Pay Gap Report

Arconic UK Gender Pay Gap Report

Our commitment starts at the top

Arconic’s success depends on our ability to create innovative solutions that 
exceed our customers’ goals.  We achieve this by leveraging the diversity of 
thought, experience and skills within our organisation. Our goal is to become 
the premier destination for the best talent to build successful careers.

We have a three-part strategy focused on creating an outstanding Arconic 
experience, where each individual can contribute their best work in a welcoming, 
vibrant environment.
Inclusion is about creating an environment where all of our people feel, and are, 
valued, where they are able to bring their differences to work each day, and where 
they can contribute their personal best in every encounter to achieve better 
business results.
Diversity refers to the variety of differences and similarities between people, 
such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, language, education, 
geography, disability, sexual orientation, work style, work experience, job role or 
function, thinking style, or personality type.
Innovation is the result of supporting ideas in a collaborative way, wherever they 
might come from, and applying the company’s scale and expertise to address 
customer needs more efficiently and effectively.

“Inclusion and Diversity is a way of life - not 
just a strategic imperative. This is how we will 
continue to drive innovation and advance 
Arconic as a global leader in the lightweight 
metals industry”.

What is the gender pay gap?

A measure of the difference in the average pay of men and women - regardless of 
the nature of their work - across an entire organisation, business sector, industry 
or the economy.  It can be impacted by the shape of the organisation, and by the 
number of both men and women across all roles. 
Gender pay is not the same as equal pay which deals with the pay 
differences between men and women who carry out the same, 
similar or equivalent work.
We have provided the gender pay gap number for all of our Arconic UK business 
in addition to those we are legally required to report, so that we can provide a 
clear and transparent view on the gap that exist within our business.

We currently are required to report on the following 6 key measures:
Hourly pay
• 
• 
• 

 Difference in the mean (average) hourly pay of male and female employees 
 Difference in the median hourly  pay of male and female employees 
 The proportion of males and females when the workforce is divided into four 
groups or quartiles from the lowest hourly pay to the highest

Bonus
• 
• 
• 

 Difference in the mean (average) bonus pay of male and female employees
 Difference in the median bonus pay of male and female employees
 Proportion of male and female employees who have received bonus pay

Understanding the gap
• 

 We often see males or females are over-represented in specific roles.  
For example, administrative roles, which tend to be lower paid, are traditionally 
dominated by females whilst engineering is higher paid and tends to be 
dominated by males
  Our lower quartile is the highest percentage for females, these roles tend to  
be less technical and as a result lower paid regardless of gender – 46% of our 
female population
  Our bonus schemes are gender neutral by design, but the shape of the 
workforce drives the mean bonus gap, in the same way it does the gender  
pay gap
  Bonus can be significantly influenced by the business units success each year
  Majority of our bonus schemes are paid as a percentage of salary, so the 
higher the pay the bigger the payout, but is impacted by pro rata for new 
starters and part time workers

Other considerations

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 Analysis of the data demonstrates that the pay gap is largely due to the structure of 
our workforce, specifically the limited female representation (10%) in higher banded 
operational roles and in the higher paid specialist professionals within our businesses

 The manufacturing sector predominately requires employees to work shifts, 55% of 
our employees work set shift patterns, 92% of these are male and whilst there is no 
occupational reason for male dominance in these traditional manufacturing roles, 
which offer little flexibility, it still continues to be a challenge to attract females

  Some differences can be due to us acquiring businesses but not harmonising on terms 
and conditions, we’ve had a number of acquisitions in the UK over the years

  Our pay award philosophy by design is for all based on pay for performance and same 
opportunity for the same job responsibility

  We apply a structured approach to job sizing, and attach pay ranges to our salaried 
roles within the business

Final thoughts
We recognise that this is an area of focus for us, and it’s our long-term  
view to challenge how we recruit and encourage more females to join our 
organisation, and to continue their career progression into more of the 
senior roles within our business.
We confirm that our data has been calculated according to the requirements 
of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
