Since 1936, we have helped drivers locally and further afield with our knowledge of new and used car sales, and comprehensive aftersales service. We work in close partnership with several prestigious car brands, such as Audi, Mazda, Volkswagen and Honda, and are dedicated to helping customers find their perfect car. We have a wide scope of models available, able to cater to all kinds of drivers and needs. Our new models showcase modern designs and state-of-the-art technologies, and as we are passionate about what we do, we always strive to find the latest news and information on new releases. Drift Bridge can not only provide advice and guidance on your car of choice, but we can also provide a great deal with our regular offers across each marque. Drift Bridge also has a wide selection of Approved Used models, which are all fully inspected and come with a complete warranty for your peace of mind. Our used models are like-new, and our stock is always changing. We can also provide a valuation on your current model, where you may be able to carry out a part exchange. Working closely with the Motability Scheme, we have helped many disabled drivers become more mobile. We also provide fleets to businesses, and have competitive finance contracts for individual business users. On top of our car sales in new and used models, our aftersales centre can ensure your car is always performing as it should. No matter what repair or replacement part is required, or even if you need a standard MOT, our trained technicians will get you back on the road in no time. Drift Bridge Group is proud to have helped thousands of drivers over the years, and you will find our dealerships across the south of England. Get in touch with us now by calling or enquiring online and one of our expert team members will get back to you.
