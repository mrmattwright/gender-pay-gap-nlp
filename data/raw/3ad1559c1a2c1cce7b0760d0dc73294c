Shell in the UK (Shell UK) has a mean gender pay gap of 22.2%. This gap arises because of demographics within Shell UK and the wider energy industry. We recognise that traditionally a greater proportion of men than women have studied for, and pursued, careers in the energy sector, and this trend continues today. As a result, Shell UK currently employs twice as many men as women and has a greater number of men than women in senior and technical positions. This has resulted in a gender pay gap.  Shell UK has been working to address this imbalance and continues to do so. We aim to ensure the equal participation of women and men in all areas of work, at all levels and locations ensuring equal access to the same recognition, reward and career progression opportunities.  You can read more about our progress towards gender balance and the Shell UK 2017 gender pay gap report here.  “Achieving Gender Balance is at the heart of our business plans, it is not a “nice to do” or an “add on”.”  – Sinead Lynch, UK Country Chair.
