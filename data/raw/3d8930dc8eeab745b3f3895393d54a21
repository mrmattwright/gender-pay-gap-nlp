We are therefore committed to ensuring that people are paid fairly for the work that they do and to ensuring that all staff are empowered to operate at their highest levels.  We take our equal pay obligations very seriously. We have been conducting equal pay audits regularly since 2009 and our results are below the threshold stipulated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to require further investigation.  Our gender pay gap results show that there is a difference between male and female pay at the University and we are very clear that our work in this area needs to continue and we need to improve our gender pay gap.  The following pages set out our equal pay and gender pay gap data in more detail and more importantly provide information on the work we are undertaking and have got planned to ensure equality of opportunity for all our staff regardless of gender". Professor Robert Allison, Vice-Chancellor and President of Loughborough University  The Gender Pay Gap is a concept that measures the difference between the pay of men and women regardless of the roles.  Equal Pay is a concept that measures pay between men and women in work of ‘equal value’.  Both have helpful purposes but are different concepts. We report on both here.        Equal pay   Equal pay identifies differences in pay between men and women doing work of equal value. Through our commitments to the Athena SWAN charter, since 2009, we have undertaken regular equal pay audits, and, since 2015/16, full audits of pay have been annual.  Grade 1-8  Our audits have consistently shown that across grades 1 – 8 pay is fair, and within Equality and Human Rights Commission guidelines.

Following guidance from the Equality & Human Rights Commission (EHRC) a difference of 5% or more and a recurring difference of 3% or more will merit further investigation.  Grade 9  The calculation of work of equal value for employees beyond the grade 9 minimum threshold is limited to Professors. The median pay gap of 6.9% observed in 2016 has decreased to 3.1% and is now below the EHRC threshold for further investigation.  Further investigation shows that differences in pay can be explained by length of time as a professor (including time as professor previous to employment at Loughborough).  Much of our efforts to decrease the professorial pay gap have been through our commitment to the Athena SWAN gender equality charter, further details of which are listed below.      Gender pay gap results   Loughborough University is committed to achieving equality for all those who learn and work here and seeks to develop a demonstrably fair and supportive environment which provides equality of opportunity and freedom from unlawful discrimination.  Following the Equality Act 2010 Regulations 2017 we are reporting our gender pay gap figures.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay (median and mean) between all men and women at the University on the 31st March in a given year. The data for March 2017 is as follows:  Mean gender pay gap: Women's hourly rate is 24.3% lower  Median gender pay gap: Women's hourly rate is 27.7% lower  This gap is largely attributable to the fact that female colleagues are employed in roles that are at lower grades and are not ‘equal work’ under the equal pay concept.  Proportions of men and women in each mean hourly rate quartile pay band      Quartile    Men    Women      Top    66.7%    33.3%      Upper middle    52.3%    47.7%      Lower middle    43.8%    56.2%      Lower    30.4%    69.6%      Mean bonus pay: Women’s bonus pay is 35.1% lower  Median bonus pay: Women’s bonus pay is 46.4% lower  Proportion receiving bonus: Men – 12.4% Women – 12.3%  The University is committed to reducing its gender pay gap and to monitoring equal pay. Further details are provided below.      Work undertaken to improve our gender pay gap    Since achieving our first Athena SWAN award (2009) the number of women lecturers has grown by 70%. In our STEM Schools a third of lecturers are women and a third of readers are women. We recognise that our subject mix may be a contributing factor in our low levels of women professors and are working to ensure that  the improved figures in more junior roles  will result, in time, into higher levels of women professors. Further details on our initiatives in this area are provided below.  We have introduced a University-wide PDR (Performance and Development Review) process which links more closely to reward. As a result, all staff who receive a performance rating of excellent are eligible to be considered for a reward.  We have paid particular attention this year (2017/18) to ensuring PDR for our staff in operational roles (e.g. cleaning roles which are largely occupied by women) is carried out effectively so that their performance is recognised appropriately and their development needs are considered.  We have radically changed the academic promotion criteria to support more women into senior academic positions. The revised criteria recognises contributions beyond research and caters for career breaks.  Increasing numbers of academic women are attending Aurora scheme to support progress to senior levels.  We have improved our maternity returners support guidance for  academic staff to retain our women and support their progression.  We have developed a new role to support the recruitment of senior appointments which includes dedicated support and advice on matters such as relocation, schools for dependent children and housing.  We have introduced Professorial briefing sessions, delivered by the DVC & PVCR, to encourage the progression of women to senior academic levels.  We have piloted the use of targeted advertising to drive more applications from women for academic roles at all levels through our recent and very successful academic staff recruitment campaign, Excellence 100.  All recruitment panel chairs are required to undergo Recruitment & Selection training and for all academic appointments both genders must be represented on interview panels.  From 2014, the proportions of women applying for academic vacancies has increased to 30% (from 22%), shortlisting has gone up to 35% (26%) and the proportions of offers to women has increased to 45% (from 32%) – at Lecturer level 50% of new appointment are women.  We have developed in house unconscious bias training and purchased online materials.  We have incorporated unconscious bias training into our Recruitment & Selection training.  Senior leaders of the University attend an annual E&D session which is delivered by the Equality Challenge Unit.       Work planned to improve our gender pay gap    We intend to take the learning from Excellence 100 and look to roll out to all recruitment campaigns to further encourage more women to join Loughborough, e.g. targeted advertising on Facebook.  We are conducting a thorough review of our flexible working provision and practices including the support available to women returning from maternity leave.  We will introduce in our 2018 reward rounds, a minimum excellence reward of £750 instead of the current 3%.  We aim to introduce routine reviews of academic women not recently promoted to ensure development needs are being met to enable progression to senior academic positions.  We will explore how sponsorship mentoring can be rolled out across campus.  We have recently made online unconscious bias training mandatory for all staff and all new starters.  All Schools are required to have submitted or hold an Athena SWAN award by 2022.  Our aim is to increase our percentage of women professors in STEM Schools to 20% by 2022.
