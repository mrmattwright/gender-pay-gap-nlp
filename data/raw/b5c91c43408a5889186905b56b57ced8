Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 the College has a legal duty to report on gender pay. Schedule 2 of the Regulations state “the governing body of an institution in England within the further education sector ….. are legally required to publish such information.  The figures set out in this report have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  Under the regulations there are six calculations that the College are required to report on. These are:   Average gender pay gap as a mean average  Average gender pay gap as a median average  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a bonus payment  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest to highest pay    Gender pay gap information differs from equal pay or equal pay for work of equal value.  Gender pay gap differs from equal pay. Equal pay deals with the differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value, whereas the gender pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women.   Scope of Report   The data for this exercise has been taken from the March 2017 payroll which includes the snapshot date of 31 March 2017;  The data includes all employees who are paid on a substantive or fixed term basis;  The data includes basic pay and relevant allowances but not overtime pay, redundancy or termination payments, or non-cash benefits such as those paid through salary sacrifice;    Stockton Riverside College Results  The data used for this exercise has been taken directly from the College’s HR/Payroll database and covers the snapshot period of 31 March 2017.  The mean gender pay gap  The mean hourly rate of pay for all male full-pay relevant employees is £14.41. The mean hourly rate of pay for all female full-pay relevant employees is £12.34.  The mean gender pay gap therefore equates to 16.77%.  The median gender pay gap  The median hourly rate of pay for all male full-pay relevant employees is £14.04. The median hourly rate of pay for all female full-pay relevant employees is £11.69.  The median gender pay gap therefore equates to 20.10%.  The mean bonus gender pay gap  The College does not make bonus payments  The proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  The College does not make bonus payments  The proportion of males and females in each quartile band  The table below shows, in chart form, the College’s pay profile by quartiles   Of the 117 relevant full-pay employees in the lower quartile, 15 are male and 102 are female. This means that 13% are male and 87% are female.  Of the 117 relevant full-pay employees in the lower middle quartile, 39 are male and 78 are female. This means that 33 % are male and 67% are female.  Of the 118 relevant full-pay employees in the upper middle quartile, 51 are male and 67 are female. This means that 43% are male and 57% are female.  Of the 117 relevant full-pay employees in the upper quartile, 48 are male and 69 are female. This means that 43% are male and 59% are female.      Pay Quartiles by Gender    Band  Males  Females  Description    A  13%  87%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile    B  33%  67%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at / below the median    C  43%  57%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at / below the upper quartile    D  41%  59%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile      Conclusion  This is the first time that the College has published our gender pay gap. The College’s mean gender pay gap is £ 2.07 per hour (16.77%) and the median gender pay gap is £2.35 per hour (20.10%).   Underlying causes of the gender pay gap  Under the law, men and women must receive equal pay for:   the same or broadly similar work;  work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or  work of equal value.   Stockton Riverside College is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other protected characteristic. As such:   All managers receive annual training in fair external and internal recruitment practice;  Workforce profile reports are provided to Governors on a regular basis;  Job roles are evaluated and allocated to salary bands appropriate for the duties and responsibilities of the post. An analysis of salary bands has shown that no group is disproportionately affected by the width of the bands.   The College is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.  The College’s gender profile is consistently around 2 female employees to one male and recruitment patterns reinforce these proportions.  However an analysis of the workforce has shown that the College’s cleaning staff and Learning Support Assistants are exclusively female employees and the College’s apprentices are mainly female. They all fall into the lowest salary band, which impacts upon the College’s pay averages. The Senior Leadership Team is 75% male and 25% female. This also affects the College’s pay averages.  The College will continue to take positive action to address pay imbalances between the genders in terms of its external and internal recruitment practices. In addition, the College’s management development arrangements have identified staff with the potential to progress to senior management level. There is a higher proportion of females to males undertaking the programme, and this is approximately in line with the overall gender profile of the College.
