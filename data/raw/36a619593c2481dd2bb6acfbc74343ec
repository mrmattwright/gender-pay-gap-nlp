We believe that it is important 
to not only have the right mix of 
voices within an organisation, 
but also to create an inclusive 
culture, ensuring that every 
voice is heard and valued.

Foreword

At AECOM our ambition is to build a 
better world. We are driven by a core 
belief that in order to better understand 
that world and serve our clients, we must 
harness the benefits of a truly diverse and 
inclusive workforce. 
The diversity agenda is not just a 
numbers game or a tick box exercise; at 
its heart it is cultural change whereby 
we tackle unconscious bias, set the 
bar high in terms of accountability 
and seek behaviour change right 
through the organisation. At AECOM, 
we also recognise that diversity 
needs inclusion in order to thrive. 
We believe that it is important to not 
only have the right mix of voices within 
an organisation, but also to create an 

inclusive culture, ensuring that every 
voice is heard and valued—ultimately 
we are seeking diversity of thought 
because we know this will create a 
high-performing organisation.
I am proud of the progress we have 
already made towards gender equality 
in our business, including removing 
potential bias from the recruitment 
processes to ensure a more diverse 
range of candidates, flexible working, 
mentoring programmes and our newly 
launched return to work scheme. We 
know there is no silver bullet, but by 
assessing critically each aspect of the 
employee journey from recruitment to 
development to promotion, we know 
we have the best chance of success.

I strongly believe that the incredible 
diversity of our people and our 
commitment to doing the right thing 
are some of AECOM’s key strengths as 
a company. As such, we’re determined 
that our workforce fully represents the 
communities we serve and that career 
progression reflects performance, talent 
and behaviours, and nothing else.

We know that building a fully 
diverse and inclusive culture is a 
long-term commitment and we 
have a clear ambition to do more 
as we move towards becoming 
a company that our people want 
to work for and are proud of.

I welcome the implementation of 
mandatory gender pay gap reporting 
as one important step in ensuring 
progression and transparency in the 
workplace. The philosophy behind 
creating an environment where our 
people feel that they can completely be 
themselves and valued, aligns with our 
existing diversity and inclusion strategy. 
At AECOM, we are committed to 
advancing women in the workplace and 
are proud of the progress we have  
already made towards gender equality in 
our business.  

Through our pledges and actions, in 2017, 
34% of all UK&I new hires were female; 
double the industry average. We know 
that building a fully diverse and inclusive 
culture is a long-term commitment 
and we have a clear ambition to remain 
fully engaged as we deliver on being a 
company that our people want to work for 
and are proud of.
Our STEM outreach work is also 
an important part of our long-term 
strategy—it is imperative that more 
women are encouraged to consider a 
career in the sector, right from an early 
age. And we believe the best people to 
support aspiring engineers are those 

already in the industry. It’s up to us to lead 
the charge in helping groups of young 
men and women become the engineers 
of the future. By becoming more visible in 
the work we do, we will increase diversity 
in STEM, and ultimately in our workplace.

WHY WE HAVE A GENDER PAY GAP
Like most organisations in our industry, the primary 
reason for our gender pay gap is an imbalance 
of male and female colleagues at different levels 
across the organisation. We have fewer women in 
more senior positions, as well as a higher proportion 
of women relative to men in more junior roles.
AECOM operates several different bonus 
arrangements to recognise strong business, team 
and individual contributions. Our bonus pay gap 
reflects lower female representation across the 
organisation’s more senior levels where bonus is 
a larger component of overall compensation. 
The shortage of women in STEM in what has been a 
traditionally male dominated industry also represents 
a significant challenge we share with the wider 
UK economy, resulting in under representation 
of females at all levels. In the UK, only 25% of all 
graduates in science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM) are women, and in engineering 
and technology, this figure is just 14%.
It is important to note that gender pay gap is not 
synonymous with unequal pay. The issue of pay inequity 
(i.e., unequal pay) is paying women and men differently 
for doing comparable work. This is not what our report 
and statistics indicate. Gender pay gap is the difference 
between the median average of women’s and men’s 
compensation reported in broad categories established 
by the UK government. It is not a comparison of 
compensation for comparable jobs. With that said, it is 
AECOM’s goal to close the pay gap in our company and 
industry through our diversity and inclusion efforts.
