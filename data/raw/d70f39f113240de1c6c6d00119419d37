We are pleased that MAWWFRS has a gender pay gap lower than comparable national figures. However, we accept there is more to do to fully embrace gender parity. This is not simple, easy or a quick fix; gender pay gaps are the outcome of economic, cultural, societal and educational factors, and Fire Services face a significant challenge in undoing years of misconceptions and occupational segmentation.   We are a public service organisation and need to reflect the communities we serve. There is no doubt that we are on a journey, with a long road ahead, but we are proud of the steps the Service has taken, and plan to take, to redress any imbalances. In doing so, we have witnessed the benefits diversity and inclusion bring to our organisation   Chris Davies, Chief Fire Officer                Sitemap | Accessibility | Website Terms | Privacy Policy Service Software Systems  National Training Awards Ambassador  Green Dragon Environmental Standard  Browse Aloud  Corporate Health Standard - Gold Award   (c) 2012 Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service
