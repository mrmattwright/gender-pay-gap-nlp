Virgin Media UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

At Virgin Media, we believe in creating a diverse and gender 
balanced workforce which reflects the customers and communities 
we serve and ensures our people can be their best selves at work.

We have a mean gender pay gap of 9% (average) and a median 
(middle) gender pay gap of 17.4%. This is smaller than the current 
national median average of 18.1%, but we know we still have work to 
do to close the gap. 

We believe in job opportunities for everybody regardless of gender. 
But we can and should, challenge ourselves to be more inclusive. 

We want to create a truly inclusive culture and have a willingness to 
be ‘straight up’ and have a debate about some issues which, even 
today, there is no simple answer for.

• We know that our gender pay gap is not a pay issue, but down 

to lack of female representation in certain roles, including STEM 
roles (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) and 
leadership. We have 3 times more men than women in our senior 
roles for example. 

• With a median bonus gap of just 0.05%, we know we are 

rewarding our people eligible for a bonus equally.  

• When looking at pay within each of the pay quartiles, we 
know that a difference of less than 1% exists between men 
and women. 

How we will make a difference:

Attract and nurture the widest possible female talent pool
• Continue to attract women to develop and take STEM careers
• Introducing positive action in recruitment, ensuring 1:3 women 

on shortlists for senior roles

Equip and empower our leaders to own and drive inclusion
• Bringing women leaders together through the Balanced Network 

creating opportunities for career development
• Launching an internal mentoring programme

around our gender aims, including 50/50 balance of women and 
men at all job levels by 2025

• Making sure that every policy, procedure and piece of line 

Make inclusion a normal part of who we are and what we do
• Setting ourselves ambitious measures to hold us to account 

manager guidance encourages inclusive ways of working and 
reinforces the Virgin way
