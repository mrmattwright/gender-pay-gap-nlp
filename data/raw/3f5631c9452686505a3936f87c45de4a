I confirm this information is accurate and follows the guidelines set out- John Diviney (Managing Director) 

Petrogas Group UK LTD is one of the fastest growing forecourt retailers in the UK. We combine a low fuel price 
offer with a high quality food offer across our Forecourts and Service Stations. We ensure we operate a fair 
and equitable pay structure for all of colleagues throughout the business.  

In April 2017 the government approved 
new legislation which meant that 
employers with over 250 employees in 
the UK had to report on their Gender 
Pay Gap.  

The Gender Pay Gap has been 
calculated using our people data from 
April 2017 (Snapshot Date) and the 
guidelines set out by the government.

the Gender Pay Gap” 

John Diviney, Managing Director 

Petrogas is committed to ensuring pay 
is based on the job being undertaken 
rather than any other factors, including 
gender. We acknowledge there is a 
Gender Pay Gap of 10.4% which is due 
to employing a small senior team with 
an uneven gender distribution. These 
leadership roles typically attract higher 
salaries and bonuses, however our 
gender pay gap still falls well below the 
UK average.  
 Our Median Gender Pay Gap of 0.87% 
is substantially lower than the UK 
average and we are proud and 
committed to ensuring it stays that way.
