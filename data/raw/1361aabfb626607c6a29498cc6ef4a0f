Gender Pay Gap Reporting       The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2016 requires employers with 250 or more employees to publicly disclose information regarding how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. The intention of the mandatory Gender Pay Gap Reporting regulations is to demonstrate that as a public sector organisation we are ensuring compliance with the Public Sector Equality Duty and are transparent in our disclosure of such information in accordance with the required need to publish such information about gender pay gaps by 31st March 2018.  Dudley Council is committed to the promotion of equality of opportunity and choice for all of its employees and ensures that it has a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects the community it serves.
