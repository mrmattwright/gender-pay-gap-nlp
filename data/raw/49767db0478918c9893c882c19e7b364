See how Arm creates positive change at scale through its people, innovation, investment, and leadership in four key areas.                  Ethical Business Practices  Our business practices must reflect our core values of fairness, openness, and integrity. It is how we govern the company, how we treat our people, how we engage with local communities, and how we transact business across our value chain.  Learn More                   Socially Responsible Technology  Arm technology is pervasive on a global scale and so then is the opportunity for Arm technology to “do good” — in areas like the environment, healthcare, economic development, and education — in both developed and emerging economies of the world.  Learn More                   Sustainable Healthcare  Throughout the developing world, people are experiencing the benefits of Arm’s technical innovation, financial investment, and partnerships with charities, NGOs, and governments across a wide variety of programs aimed at improving healthcare. Arm supports programs designed to have maximum societal impact and improve the lives of people who have benefitted from technology.  Learn More                   STEM Education  Arm is acutely focused on solving the shortage of young people, especially women, pursuing careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math), a problem that persists despite STEM’s proven success as a path to upward economic mobility. However our approach in education goes beyond developing the technical skills associated with these subjects to address the softer skills that will be critical for individuals to succeed in a rapidly changing and uncertain world, such as creativity, resilience, teamwork, agility and communication.
