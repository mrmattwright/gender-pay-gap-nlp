This is something we have always done - and in fact our entire salary structure is designed with fairness in mind.   Aldi's gender pay compared to the UK                  At Aldi you are paid based on the role you undertake for the business and your length of service. No other factors, including gender, come into play. For example, every Graduate Area Manager that joins Aldi starts on £44,000, irrespective of any other factors. Their rate of pay is then increased annually based on their length of service. This is the same approach we take for all other roles and it’s something we’re really proud of, because it makes us one of the few retailers that pay male and female colleagues exactly the same amount at every level of our business. Not only do we pay all our employees fairly and ensure they have access to the same opportunities, our pay and benefits are also the highest in the retail sector. We’re renowned for our graduate training scheme where we were ranked third in The Times Top 100 Graduate Employees for 2017 – the highest-ranked retailer. Our rapid growth in the UK has enabled thousands of our people to advance their careers through the opportunities that we create at all levels of our company. We pay our colleagues equally, but it is important to distinguish between equal pay and the gender pay gap. Equal pay issues arise when men and women are paid differently despite doing the same work or work of equal value - something that isn’t an issue here at Aldi. Gender pay however is a much broader concept that compares the average earnings of men and women within an organisation. This difference is expressed as the percentage difference between men and women’s pay. According to the Office of National Statistics, the UK’s current mean gender pay gap is 17.4%, while the median figure is 18.4%. The causes of a gender pay gap can be complex. It isn’t simply about ensuring men and women in the same roles are paid equally. There are a number of other factors at play, such as working hours and the number of men and women in different roles across a business. That is why the UK government has introduced a requirement for all employers to publish their gender pay gap to identify differences in pay between male and female employees across our entire business regardless of job role. The intention is that by monitoring the pay gap between men and women, organisations can better understand why any gap exists and take action to try and reduce it.  Aldi’s gender pay by quartiles As part of the Gender Pay Gap reporting process, employers have been asked to split their workforce into four groups based on pay, and to show the proportion of male and female employees in each quartile. Having looked at our results in detail we have identified that the majority of our gap is as the result of having more men than women in store management positions in the upper quartile (see Figure 2).                  Bonus Pay Aldi does not pay bonuses based on individual performance to male or female colleagues. While both our mean and median gender pay gap figures are significantly better than the UK average, we recognise that there is more that we can do to close this gap. While we have always ensured colleagues have access to the same opportunities and recognise there are a number of factors outside of our control, such as an employee’s personal choice of working hours to suit their individual circumstances, we recognise that there is more we can do to address our gender pay gap. This is something we are absolutely committed to.  Closing the gap Aldi has always been an organisation where people can thrive and develop regardless of their gender or background and we will continue to offer fair, equitable pay to all colleagues. We have established the Women in Aldi Forum to look at aspects of gender diversity and representation. We are committed to reporting our gender pay gap on an annual basis.  I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate. James Hutcheson. Managing Director - Corporate Finance and Administration.
