At Autoneum, we do this by using a comprehensive Compliance program that is based on three pillars. The aim of this is to avoid, detect early and, if necessary, react to any infringements of the law and the Code of Conduct so that we can uphold our responsibility and prevent any damage to Autoneum and third parties.  Our Compliance Program is based on an annual risk analysis. The results of this facilitate precise and efficient management of compliance activities. Our Code of Conduct as well as directives, training courses, e-learning programs and the provision of individual advice aim to support our employees in specific dilemma situations.  In addition to internal communication channels, the “Speak Up Line” reporting system is also available for identifying any potential misconduct. Reports are followed up with fair investigations. Clear responses and consequences serve to punish any misconduct and eliminate weaknesses.                  Code of Conduct Core Component of the Compliance Program As a global market and technology leader, Autoneum aims to act in an exemplary manner at all levels and in particular in its business relations. Our stakeholders, be they customers, investors, suppliers, business partners or employees, expect Autoneum always to gear its actions towards the highest ethical standards. The assumption of our ethical and legal responsibility – be this towards external stakeholders or employees – is reflected in our strict compliance with laws, provisions, regulations and internal guidelines.  The Code of Conduct is based on the corporate values of Autoneum and specifies in detail the expectations and standards applicable within the scope of our business activities and their concrete implementation. The principles set out in the Code of Conduct are binding for all employees at all locations in all countries. Management employees are expected to set an example for others through their own behavior and in doing so to create an open working environment based on trust.  All employees of Autoneum must be aware of their personal responsibility and at all times display ethically unimpeachable conduct in accordance with the Code of Conduct. Compliance with the standards set out in the Code of Conduct is of core importance for the long-term success of Autoneum. Infringements of the Code of Conduct are therefore not tolerated.  Code of Conduct | PDF         Speak Up Line We wish to encourage our employees and business partners to contact and notify us of any potential misconduct or if they have any further questions. Reliable reporting channels and protection against sanctions for internal whistleblowers help to ensure that any potential misconduct can be reported, thoroughly investigated and resolved. Various reporting channels are available for gaining knowledge of any compliance infringements.  If, as an employee, you become aware of any infringement of the law or our Code of Conduct, or if you have any questions concerning compliance, you should initially contact your supervisor, HR representative or the Legal & Compliance department.  Please send an email to the Legal & Compliance team at compliance@autoneum.com .
