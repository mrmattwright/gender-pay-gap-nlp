HSS HIRE 
GENDER  
PAY REPORT

2017

At HSS Hire Group we are committed 
to diversity in our workforce, with 
equal opportunities for males and 
females across all areas of our 
business. Here we release our gender 
pay report which shows a median 
pay gap of 8.2%. 

UNDERSTANDING THE HIRE INDUSTRY 

The hire industry is typically 
male dominated; however 
we are committed to 
attracting more women into 
our business, and rewarding 
them consistently with the 
salary, bonus and benefit 
structures of our male 
colleagues.

THE PAY GAP

We are committed to paying all our colleagues fairly, regardless of gender, and the results released in this 
report demonstrate that the gap at HSS is significantly lower than the national average of 17.4%. This gap 
is simply due to a higher number of males occupying more senior roles across the business.

ANALYSIS OF COLLEAGUES  

RECEIVING A BONUS

The majority of our senior level sales roles are occupied by male colleagues, whilst many of our female 
sales colleagues are in more junior roles which receive a lower level of bonus payment. Bonus levels are 
purely dictated by role, so where males and females are in the same role, their entitlement is the same.

WHAT ARE WE DOING TO INCREASE THE  
NUMBER OF FEMALES IN OUR BUSINESS? 

We are committed to closing the gender pay gap, and increasing the 
number of women occupying senior roles within all areas of our business. 
Each month we produce dashboard reports for the senior management 
team with gender diversity statistics, and we are actively looking at ways 
to help us improve this. 
In March of each year we undertake campaigns internally and externally 
to support International Women’s Day, which aim to promote the 
broad range of careers available to women at HSS Hire. We believe that 
increasing awareness of the range of opportunities within the hire industry 
plays a key role in attracting more women into our business. We are 
currently implementing new agreements with the recruitment agencies we 
work alongside to ensure that they are providing gender diverse short lists 
for any roles they they are helping us to recruit.

Our generous benefits package is designed to be both 
family friendly and to help women in the workplace, with a 
number of flexible working options available in many roles, 
as well as benefits such as childcare vouchers and healthcare 
cover. We also offer enhanced maternity benefits, including 
12 weeks maternity leave at 90% of earnings, doubling the 
statutory 6 weeks offered by most other employers.
