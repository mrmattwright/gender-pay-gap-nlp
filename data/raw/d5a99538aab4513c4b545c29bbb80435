REPORTING PERIOD 1ST APRIL 2016 - 31ST MARCH 2017

The New World Trading co family is inclusive of people from
all walks of life, creating diverse teams across the UK, and
pioneering gender balanced workforces within the hospitality
industry. Our company vision of creating amazing spaces to be
enjoyed by all is mirrored within our recruitment strategy
where we approach each individual with the same respect and
opportunities.  

We have a mean gender pay gap of 15.8% (average), and a
median gender pay gap of 6.8% (middle). Although, the mean
gap is reduced to 7.9% when Management Buy Out bonuses
are excluded, leaving us a more realistic representation of our
recruited workforce.  

These figures are lower than the national average, but we 
identify there is still movement to be made within The NWTC 
to close this gap for us to truly pioneer the eradication of 
gender pay gaps in the industry. 

Our family culture at New World is the very essence of the 
company, creating fully inclusive environments for all our team 
members, and nurturing and supporting each team member to 
fulfill their potential both professionally and personally. We 
pioneer real careers within the hospitality industry, and 
incredible experiences for development in work, and within our 
communities.

The lower and lower middle quartiles encompass equal values 
of male and females within the company. Our team members 
are paid equally regardless of gender, so the variances in our 
gender pay gap comes from a lack of female representation 
within the more senior roles in The NWTC (represented in 
upper middle and upper quartiles). These are representations 
of senior management roles in sites, and senior roles within our 
Head Office teams and Directors. 

The variances in the bonus pay gap is down to this current 
team representation across senior roles. Our mean bonus pay 
gap is 59.9%, but when excluding MBO bonuses this gap is 
greatly reduced to 21.8%.  

The higher male senior representation, are the roles where 
higher bonuses are paid, which explains the wider bonus gap 
and leads the direction for us to focus on bringing more 
females into senior roles. The work ahead now needs to deliver 
equal representation for our two upper quartiles, just as the 
first two quartiles are currently equally male to female. 

The median bonus pay gap sits at -139.9%, showing higher 
bonuses accrued by female team members, within mid-senior 
roles. This is a very positive analysis of our data, showing 
large numbers of engaged, ambitious and motivated females 
within The NWTC who can be supported into senior roles, 
which in turn will aid in reducing the current gaps.  

PIONEERING GENDER EQUALITY IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY 
At NWTC Equality training is mandatory for every single 
team member, this will continue to be part of our industry- 
leading training program, ensuring our future remains 
inclusive of all who join the company. 

Focusing on benefits to support working mothers is another 
channel of focus, last year we enhanced maternity packages 
and now deliver leading maternity for our industry. Our 
benefits package also includes childcare vouchers, ensuring we 
support the professional development of females with families 
equally to all other team members. 

Our Talent Managers develop inclusive recruitment projects 
and use channels that will continue to attract males and 
females equally. One new initiative The New World  
Management Academy, will offer a development platform for 
junior bright stars within the company.
