The Trust was created with the formation of an academy of six Catholic schools within the De Lisle College family of schools. They are:   De Lisle College: A Catholic Voluntary Academy  Holy Cross School: A Catholic Voluntary Academy  Sacred Heart Catholic Voluntary Academy  St. Clare’s Primary School: A Catholic Voluntary Academy  St. Winefride’s Catholic Voluntary Academy  St. Mary’s Catholic Primary School: A Catholic Voluntary Academy.   The Trust also works in close partnership with two other feeder primary schools within the family and a third Leicestershire School. They are:   St Francis Catholic Primary School, Melton Mowbray  Bishop Ellis Catholic Primary School, Thurmaston, Leicester  St Charles’ Catholic Primary School, Measham.   As a Trust and family of schools we aim to provide high quality Catholic education for children between the ages of 3 and 19. We aim to nurture, challenge and support each child to fulfil their potential, whilst recognising their individuality, gifts and talents.  Please scroll down for important Trust documents.
