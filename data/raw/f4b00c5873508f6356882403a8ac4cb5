Download the full Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 – UK                              Women have historically been under-represented in the mining industry and there remain some challenges in attracting suitably qualified women into certain roles at senior levels where significant engineering experience is required, for example. This has led to a deficit of women across much of our organisation which is further magnified at the more senior levels.  As a global company with only a small head office in the UK, we absolutely recognise the benefits to our business and to our employees of redressing this imbalance and are committed to ensuring, in the first instance, at least a 33% female representation on our ExCo and those that report to that ExCo, in line with the Hampton-Alexander recommendations.  I am committed to achieving greater gender balance at all levels. We are therefore making a series of targeted changes to a number of our recruitment, succession and talent management, mentoring and other processes to support our goal of making sure we access the widest possible talent population, both in the UK and globally.

ANGLO AMERICAN SERVICES (UK) LTD HAS A WORKFORCE OF 258      % OF MEN AND WOMEN     % OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT ROLES OCCUPIED BY MEN AND WOMEN*                        ‘HOURLY PAY’ GAP     Anglo American is a large global company, headquartered in the UK, and the majority of the senior leadership team is UK-based.  The gaps shown are largely attributable to the fact that more men than women are working in more highly paid, senior roles.                           ‘HOURLY PAY’ QUARTILES     Reflecting the ‘hourly pay gap’ described above, this chart shows that there are proportionally more male employees than female employees in the higher pay quartiles.                            % OF EMPLOYEES AWARDED A BONUS FOR 2016     The illustration opposite shows the proportion of Anglo American’s UK male and female employees that received ‘bonus pay’ in 2017 in respect of their work in 2016.                           BONUS PAY GAP     Variable performance pay structures for the most senior employees differ from those of the wider workforce, thereby further widening the gap.  As the proportion of female employees increases in more senior roles, this gap will reduce.
