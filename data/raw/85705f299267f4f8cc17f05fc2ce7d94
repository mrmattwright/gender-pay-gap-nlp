The measurement must be taken each year - on 31 March for public sector organisations and 5 April for other employers - and must be made public.  The images below show you the main figures at 31 March 2017, but you can read full details in the report, which you can download below.          This information is also reported on the Government’s gender pay gap portal and will be available for a period of at least three years.
