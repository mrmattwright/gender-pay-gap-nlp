Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy  The purpose of this policy and procedure is to provide clear guidance for the prevention and detection of bribery and corruption in the ROH. The Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy applies to all staff, artists, casuals, freelancers, contractors or sub-contractors working for or on behalf of the ROH, or when working with third parties for or on behalf of the ROH. We recognize that an act of bribery or corruption is illegal, under the Bribery Act, 2010. It is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner and we are committed to ensuring adherence to the highest legal and ethical standards, implementing and enforcing systems to counter bribery and corruption.  Data Protection Policy  This policy sets out the requirements for Data Protection at the ROH, to ensure that all personal information is treated lawfully and correctly, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and related legislation including the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.  Declaration of Interest Policy  This policy applies to Trustees, the Executive team and senior managers with procurement responsibilities and/or in receipt of hospitality and gifts. Trustees and senior staff of the ROH must ensure that their personal or business interests outside work do not conflict with those of the ROH. Accordingly we ask trustees and senior staff to declare their interests (and any gifts or hospitality received over £50) in connection with their role in the ROH. A declaration of interests form is provided for this purpose and the declaration of interests form needs is updated annually.  Development Code of Fundraising Practice  This code sets out the commitments the ROH makes to companies, charitable trusts and individuals that make financial contributions towards its work. These commitments include being transparent in our dealings, not encouraging donors to change existing donations to other organizations, respecting honesty and privacy, and applying gifts responsibly to their intended purpose. We also undertake to comply with all relevant law including tax legislation, the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Furthermore, the ROH adheres to the Fundraising Regulator’s current Code of Fundraising.  Expenses Policy  This policy ensures that the ROH Group has a clear expenses framework that balances consistency with the flexibility to meet the employee and the ROH Group’s needs. It is the ROH’s intention that employees should neither lose nor gain financially as a result of incurring expenditure on ROH business. It also sets out the procedures to be adopted when making a claim for payment.  Fraud Policy and Procedure for Investigation  The purpose of this policy and procedure is to provide clear guidance for the prevention and detection of fraud to ensure that the assets of the ROH are safeguarded. The ROH encourages a culture of honesty, reliability and trustworthiness throughout the organization and is committed to ensuring that opportunities for fraud are minimized.  Health and Safety Policy  This policy set out the steps taken by the ROH to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its employees and visitors to its premises, in according the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. To this end the ROH requires all visitors to comply with its House Rules and accepted codes of conduct. In terms of governance, the Health and Safety Committee provides the formal forum for consultation on health and safety matters with the recognized Trade Unions. It is supported by the Health and Safety Management Group, which directs the programme of health and safety activity within the organization.  Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement  Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires certain organizations to develop a slavery and human trafficking statement each year. The slavery and human trafficking statement should set out what steps organizations have taken to ensure modern slavery is not taking place in their business or supply chains.  The Royal Opera House is a large organization for these purposes and welcomes the opportunity to state very clearly its policy in these respects.  The Royal Opera House unreservedly condemns modern slavery and human trafficking wherever in the world it occurs.  The steps we have taken to ensure that they are not taking place in our business or supply chains are as follows:   We have prepared and formally adopted the Royal Opera House Modern Slavery and Ethical Sourcing Policy.  We have assessed our supply chains and will continually increase our vigilance in making decisions regarding our suppliers and potential suppliers by seeking confirmations and commitments as to the absence of these practices in their businesses.  We will withdraw from existing contracts (where we may lawfully do so), or decline to enter into or renew a contract with a supplier or potential supplier, if our counterparty is unable to give us sufficient confirmations and commitments.   The Royal Opera House is also required to publicize annually, on its website, its activities over the latest financial year aimed towards the eradication of modern slavery and human trafficking. The first relevant year for us was that which ended on 28 August 2016. This is our second statement of activities to be posted on our website.  Should there be any questions or concerns as to the implementation of these requirements, please direct them to the Director of Finance . If any staff are concerned that modern slavery or human trafficking is taking place in our business or supply chains they should raise their concerns to the Director of Finance or through the Whistleblowing policy.  Procurement Policy and Authorized Signatory Limits  The ROH is committed to best practice in the procurement of goods and services, and has particular obligations in this regard as an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organization. This policy sets out the principles which the ROH seeks to adhere to in procurement activities, including pursuing Value for Money (VfM), promoting environmental and social sustainability, encouraging transparent and fair competition, and adhering to ethical standards.  Records and Document Management Policy  This policy sets out the ROH’s commitment to managing records and documents in accordance with five key principles. These principles are that reliable records must be created in accordance with common standards, information must be shared rather than managed as a personal resource, access to confidential information must be restricted, information must be organized in a logical and consistent way and records must be retained for agreed periods of time. In accordance with the final principle, appropriate records must be passed to our Collections department to provide a historical record of the organization’s work.  Safeguarding Children and Young People (Policy and Procedure)  In this policy and procedure the ROH sets out its commitment to protecting the safety and welfare of children in its care, and to ensuring that its members of staff are kept informed, supported and protected from unfounded allegations of abuse. To these ends, the ROH operates within the City of Westminster safety guidelines for children in stage performances, and adheres to effective procedures for recording and responding to incidents, complaints and alleged or suspected incidents of abuse. Within their overall health and safety management responsibilities, the Director of Personnel has primary responsibility for child protection. This is supported by a Child Protection Committee, which oversees the policy and procedure.  Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure for Investigation  The ROH encourages all members of staff to raise any concerns that they may have about the conduct of others in the organization in relation to any suspected instances of fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing. This policy sets out the ROH’s position in these matters and lays out a procedure for individuals to raise any concerns and how those concerns will be dealt with. The procedure applies to all employees, casual staff, contractors and freelance staff.  Bullying and Harassment Policy  All individuals have the right to work without fear of harassment or abuse, whether on the grounds of sex, race or colour, disability, sexual orientation, age, religion, trade union membership or duties or indeed any ground. It is the Royal Opera House policy to make every effort to provide a working environment free of harassment and intimidation. Harassment may constitute unlawful behaviour. It is also improper and inappropriate behaviour that lowers morale and interferes with work effectiveness. It makes the work environment threatening. Such behaviour is unwelcome and unacceptable. It is against the policies of the Royal Opera House for an employee to harass another employee. Such conduct will not be condoned or tolerated. Whilst the implementation of the policy is the duty of the managers and supervisors, all employees are expected to comply with this policy and take appropriate measures to ensure that such conduct does not occur. Appropriate disciplinary action, including dismissal for serious offences, will be taken against any employee who violates this policy.
