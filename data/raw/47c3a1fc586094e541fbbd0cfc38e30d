Kongsberg Automotive ASA provides world-class products to the global vehicle industry. Our products enhance the driving 
experience,  making  it  safer,  more  comfortable  and  sustainable.    The  Group  has  three  business  segments;  Interiors, 
Powertrain & Chassis, and Specialty Products. 
 
Our  business  operates  across  41  locations  globally,  and  in  the  UK  has  three  divisions  representing  each  of  our  business 
segments.  Our people are employed within a wide range of disciplines including Manufacturing, Engineering, Research & 
Development, Purchasing, Sales & Program Management. 
 
This Gender Pay Gap Report is published in accordance with the UK Government GPGR regulations and results are based on

we are committed to understanding the impact to all of our UK businesses; the main report is based on UK group data, and 
reporting for each legal entity can be found on page 2 of this report.

  Kongsberg Automotive’s UK Gender Pay Gap is higher than the UK average of 18% 
  Analysis shows us that disproportionate numbers of male and female workers primarily drives the pay gap;  

o  Our industry relies on highly skilled engineering expertise; currently in the UK only 11% of all workers in 

Engineering professional roles are female 

o  This trend impacts that number of female workers occupying senior positions within the UK and has a 

detriment to the number of women receiving bonus payments 

  To control our gender pay gap, we operate a structured pay banding system for all our Manufacturing Operatives 

(who account for c.70% of the workforce), rewarding male and female employees equally for the same work 

  We continuously monitor to ensure that all male and female workers are paid equivalent rates of pay for carrying 

out similar roles, and benchmark rates of pay as an ongoing activity within our recruitment process.

I confirm that the information and data provided is accurate and in line with mandatory requirements.
