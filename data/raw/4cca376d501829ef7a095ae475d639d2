Our common shorthand is to talk about JLL as a ‘property 
company’. But, of course, our organisation is made up of people, 
not properties. Without the talent, motivation and energy of our 
employees, we wouldn’t have the successful business we’re so 
proud of. 

At JLL, ensuring that everyone in our business is paid fairly is 
fundamental to the way we go about things. It’s part of our 
strategy to create an inclusive environment to attract and 
retain the best people regardless of gender, age, ethnicity or 
background. But gender pay gap reporting helps to highlight 
something else: the imbalance between the numbers of men 
and women employed at different levels of an organisation. 
We are pleased that the UK Government is making businesses 
publish this information. It will help shine a light on any gender 
imbalance in our industry and across UK plc as a whole.  

Frankly, women have always been under-represented at the 
senior levels of the property sector. Indeed, it’s only four years 
since our own UK Board was exclusively male. Thankfully things 
have already changed a great deal. We believe that gender pay 
gap reporting will help accelerate these changes.

The good news is that JLL’s gender pay gap is narrowing.  
We are well into our journey, although there’s still work to be 
done. Gender pay gap reports provide a valuable benchmark 
which will help us create a more balanced industry for tomorrow. 
It’s good for society, and it’s good for everyone with a stake in  
our business too.

In collating the data for this report, we’ve identified a clear 
gap between the average earnings of men and women in our 
organisation, and the reason is clear and unambiguous:  
men hold four-fifths of the most senior roles in our organisation.  

Our mean gender pay gap is currently 36.7%. But we’re working 
on it. We believe the best way to address the gap is by having 
more women in our senior roles and we’re pleased to report 
that over the last two years, the number of women in JLL’s top 
positions has increased by around one-third. Over the same 
period, our mean and median gender pay gaps have fallen.

This is great progress but we won’t rest until our business 
reflects the society in which we operate. You can read about  
the work we’re doing to make this happen in this report. 

Helping people achieve their ambitions is at the centre of 
everything we do – and that includes supporting our employees 
to fulfil their potential.   

We welcome the requirement for companies to report on their 
gender pay gap because it fits with our global ambition to 
succeed through inclusion. We’re especially looking forward  
to sharing our progress with you in years to come as we 
continue to make strides throughout the business.

We confirm the data reported here is accurate.

Gender pay gap: 
the data

Gender pay gap vs. equal pay gap
A gender pay gap is not the same thing as an equal pay gap. 
The gender pay gap is defined as the difference in the average 
pay between men and women, regardless of the role they do. 
It usually results from there being more men than women in 
senior roles or vice versa. 

This is not the same as an equal pay gap which is caused by  
a failure to pay men and women the same for comparable work. 
Equal pay has been enshrined in UK law since the 1970s and is 
something we at JLL are committed to guaranteeing throughout 
the organisation. At JLL, our HR business partners work with our 
directors to monitor and challenge where appropriate any pay 
decisions that are being made. Our Remuneration Committee 
reviews all decisions around pay increases and bonuses to 
ensure we pay for performance with equality and fairness. 

Median vs mean averages
The gender pay gap regulations require us to report average pay 
gaps in two ways:  the median and the mean. The mean gives a 
more representative picture of our business, and is more useful 
in helping us shape what we need to do to close the gap,  
so whilst we include the median figures in our publication we 
have focussed on the mean in our supporting commentary.

Our median gender pay gap is 6.6% and is calculated by taking 
the middle number when men and women are sorted from high 
to low and finding the difference.  Whilst we are encouraged by 
our median number being much smaller and not skewed by a 
small number in high paying roles, it is the mean number that 
helps us identify that we have too few women in senior roles 
attracting the higher levels of pay and bonus. 
The figures 
Our mean gender pay gap is 36.7%. This figure is the result of 
men outnumbering women at the top of our organisation by 
a ratio of four to one. The impact of this can be easily seen 
by removing the 100 top earners in the organisation from the 
figures – the mean gender pay gap falls to 20%.

In our middle management grades, the figure is 8%, thanks to 
the strong pipeline of women coming up through the ranks 
across JLL. Nevertheless, we clearly have a long way to go 
before we are the gender-balanced organisation we want to  
be – and we’re working on it.

Mean and median pay and bonus gap: Our ‘pay’ figures are based on fixed 
salaries plus bonuses.

Quartile analysis: The quartiles are determined by listing everyone by hourly 
rate, high to low, and dividing the list as close to equally as possible by 4.   
This shows the representation of women in each of the quartiles. This approach 
is adopted by all reporting companies in accordance with the guidelines and 
therefore gives a consistent view of where women sit in organisations.

Understanding the gap
You can sum up the reasons for the size of the gender 
pay gap in our industry in one word: history.  
Although we have long been committed to equal pay, 
the property industry has been very male dominated  
for many years. 

Things have changed significantly, but even today four-
fifths of our most senior roles are occupied by men.  
The fact that the reward structure for these jobs 
typically includes significant bonus incentives widens 
the gap even further.

Over the next few pages we’ll look at what we’ve 
already achieved, and the work we’re doing to  
improve things further.

How we’re narrowing our 
gender pay gap

Data is most useful when it lets you see what’s happening over time. So, we went back over previous years to help create a picture of 
our progress. The results are encouraging – our gender pay gap went down from 58% to 50% between 2014 and 2017.*  

*In order to compare like for like, these figures exclude data from LaSalle and Integral.

Some of the initiatives which have helped us narrow the gap are shown on the timeline below, together with some of our key

Building change 
within JLL

We’ve made it a conscious priority to achieve a better gender 
balance at every grade within our business while remaining true 
to our principles of making sure we have the right talent in the 
right roles with the right values.

•  We’re working to provide even better support to women 

returning to work from maternity leave which includes 
coaching to help with the transition as well as a successful 
flexible working policy across all our teams

• 

• 

For the past three years our staffing levels have been 
broadly balanced with an equal ratio of men and women

In 2017 48% of new staff recruited were women

•  At entry level, we continue to attract and select a balanced 
mix of women and men. Over time, this will feed through 
the business to improve the gender balance at all levels

•  We recently introduced gender-balanced shortlists to 

ensure we start from a balanced pool of candidates

• 

• 

59% of people on our mentoring scheme are now female

Looking at our 2017/18 graduate applications, women 
outperformed men. 48% of successful canditates were 
female, despite only one third of women accounting for  
all applications.

Success through inclusion
The culture of the property industry has traditionally been one 
of long and unsociable working hours. This made it unattractive 
or impractical for people with caring responsibilities and 
commitments. Things have improved in recent years, but not 
fast enough for our liking. So, we set out to build a family-
friendly environment which would allow people to achieve a 
healthy work/life balance. We call this Success Through Inclusion.

•  We’re now creating a more flexible working culture across 
JLL, empowering employees to work in a more agile way. 
It’s not about the number of hours they spend at their 
desk in the office. It’s about the results they achieve

•  We’re also ensuring we offer a diverse range of client 
entertaining events that appeal to a broader audience

•  Since legislation around shared parental leave was 

introduced in 2015, we have seen a steady increase in the 
number of men taking this option 

•  We share gender data about each part of the organisation 
with our  directors and help them to address any imbalances

•  We’ve successfully enabled flexible working in client 

facing, transactional roles allowing the effective balance 
of being a successful city agent and a working parent.

Success through inclusion is embedded in our business 
globally. We were recognised among  the Working Mother  
100 Best Companies in 2017 and named one of the National 
Association for Female Executives Top Companies for 
Executive Women in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Building change in the industry
JLL has also been at the forefront of efforts to make the 
property industry more inclusive. 

We are one of the five founding members of Changing the Face 
of Property. Set up in 2012, this body seeks to improve diversity 
in the industry by focusing on disability, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, socio-economic background and gender. 

We are also keen to learn from best practice outside our own 
industry, and to share our own learnings openly. Our diversity 
and inclusivity memberships include Real Estate Balance, 
the Business Disability Forum and Stonewall, alongside 
engagement with both the Social Mobility Foundation and the 
Living Wage Foundation in 2017, when we were dual accredited 
as a Living Wage Employer.

Developing gender balance through our talent 
pipeline
Between 2015 and 2018 the proportion of women recruited 
through our graduate programme went up from 44% to 48% 
and the number of women being put forward for promotion has 
increased from 31% to 37% over the last 3 years. The make-up 
of our pipeline below senior management is encouraging with a 
good balance of men and women, in some cases more women 
than men. Looking at our wider EMEA region, 41% of employees 
in our succession plan for the most senior roles are female.

Our people: 
their say

Emma Eaglestone
Lead Director – Southampton, JLL

Richard Howling
Chief Operating Officer, JLL

“In 1996 the working environment was very different: 
I was the only woman in the Southampton office in a 
non-clerical role. 22 years and one merger later I am 
the lead director and today 50% of team leaders are 
women – and because they are the right people for 
the job. JLL has committed to changing the workplace 
dynamic with policies and programmes to attract and 
retain talent at every level.”

“JLL’s shared parental leave scheme enabled me to 
take time following the birth of my daughter, and be 
more of a part of her early months than I would have 
been with standard paternity leave. JLL supports 
working parents and – with a flexible approach on both 
sides – balancing career and parenting can be  
a reality.” 

Alex Finch
Director – Residential Development, JLL

“During my 14 years in the industry, I have seen 
a welcome shift in attitude. The senior leadership 
here at JLL are promoting and embracing a sense of 
change and recognising the key role diversity plays in 
delivering a successful business.

 “As a company, we need to ensure we keep nurturing 
and retaining talent to secure the right pipeline of future 
leaders as we continue to bridge the gender gap.”

Sophie Walker
Head of Sustainability and Lead Director,  
Building a Better Tomorrow, JLL

“My generation assumes we will be working into our 
seventies, so that affects how I think about work/life 
balance. I’ve had a sabbatical, am about to take my 
second maternity leave, and when I returned from work 
after my first child, I used a phased return and have 
continued to work from home regularly.  None of this 
has affected my progression to the UK Executive,  
and I’ve felt strongly supported along the way.”

Helen Gough 
Lead Director Project & Development Services, JLL

Christopher Walters
Director – Strategic Development Consulting, JLL

“I have been supported in my ambitions over the last 
16 years – joining initially as an Associate Director and 
now leading a business of over 160 people, being  
a member of the UK Exec and PDS Global Board.  
This support has also been outside of work, with  
a sabbatical to compete in the Clipper Round the 
World Yacht Race. Working at JLL has challenged me, 
developed my skills and broadened my horizons.” 

“As a new father it was important to me knowing that 
JLL would support me in my new challenge as  
a parent through flexible working and shared parental 
leave. Senior leaders and colleagues recognise the 
importance of flexibility. Being able to work from home 
more has definitely helped me build a bond with my 
new daughter while supporting my wife.”
