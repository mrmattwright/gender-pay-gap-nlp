Under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, the SPCB is required to report on its Gender Pay Gap before the end of March 2018 (using data at 31 March 2017). However, we decided to publish ahead of this deadline using data at 31 March 2106.  The Gender Pay Gap is based on average salaries and so can tell us more about the gender make-up of an organisation.  What that report showed was that while we have robust pay and job evaluation systems ensuring equal pay for work of equal value, we had a gender pay gap of 11.1%. This was due to there being more women than men in lower grades and more men than women in higher grades.  We have now published our second Gender Pay Gap report using data at 31 March 2017. Our gender pay gap has reduced to 3.8% which is well within the target we set ourselves of having a tolerance level of plus or minus 5%.  The main reason for the decrease is that there are now more men in lower grades but, while there are more women in G5 roles, the number of women in G6 and above has decreased by 13%. Given the size of the organisation, a small number of changes can make a significant statistical impact but it shows that while we have made good progress that we can be rightly proud of, there is still more work to be done.  The report also looks at salaries taking into account bonuses and overtime. This year’s report has highlighted a gender pay gap in awards made under the Exceptional Contribution Scheme. Far more women than men received awards but the average award paid to men was higher. We will be doing further analysis on this and undertaking a review of the scheme.  This is one of a number of actions we’re taking forward. Rather than having a gender pay gap action plan sitting separately, we’re taking this forward in a Diversity Action Plan for 2018/19 which includes actions to address issues highlighted by our Diversity Monitoring Report. In this report we review the data collected on the diversity of our workforce and to what extent our policies on recruitment, promotion and development are being applied fairly. The report analyses the staff profile with consideration of the nine protected characteristics in line with our requirements under the Equality Act 2010.  By introducing an anonymous form of reporting this year the number of staff who identified themselves with a protected characteristic increased but there are some groups still underrepresented in the workforce including young people who we are targeting through the Parliament’s Modern Apprenticeship Programme, black and minority ethnic and disabled people. The report also shows that women are doing well in recruitment and promotions but there are few black and minority ethnic and disabled people being appointed.  Whilst it is positive to note that our declaration rates has increased, it is important that for next year’s reporting this is aligned to the data collected by HR where current disclosure rates are low – so we have more work to do. We will be asking for your help when we start to gather this data later in the year.  There are a number of actions we will take to improve the diversity in the workforce. We will continue to develop our recruitment processes and work with the Diversity Staff Networks to raise awareness about the importance of diversity in the Parliament.  Access the Gender Pay Gap report and Diversity Monitoring report and action plan .  Staff will have an opportunity to discuss the Gender Pay Gap report at a Women’s Network event on 19 April and the Diversity Monitoring Report at a future snippet. More details will follow.
