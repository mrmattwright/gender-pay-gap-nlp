Gender Pay Gap: Data and Overview 
 
ODST is a multi-academy trust formed in 2012. As of 31st March 2017, there were 21 member schools and 882 
post-holders, some of whom had multiple roles within a particular school. Each school within ODST has the 
delegated autonomy to make a job offer and determine the salary rate that it offers an employee, subject to 
adhering to the agreed national pay scales for teaching or support staff.  
 
Where a post-holder holds two roles paid at different rates, the reported data includes both salaries. 
 
Overall 7.7% of ODST’s post holders as of 31st March 2017 are male; this includes 5 Headteachers (24% of the 
total) and 25 other members of teaching staff (9.5% of the total). However just 34 male post holders (5.5% of 
the total) hold non-teaching roles- predominantly premises or teaching assistant posts. 
 
 
The data required under The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 is as follows: 
 
1. average gender pay gap as a mean average:  17.85%   
2. average gender pay gap as a median average: 23.67%   
3. average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average:  n/a          
4. average bonus gender pay gap as a median average:  n/a          
5. proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a bonus payment: no 
bonus payments made               
6. proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest to highest pay:       

•  Q1          7% male: 93% female 
•  Q2          5% male: 95% female 
•  Q3          8% male: 92% female 
•  Q4          11% male: 89% female 

 
 
Internal analysis indicates that when females and males in ODST who hold the same job role are compared, 
the mean salary for female staff is at least the same as that for their male comparator, if not slightly above. 
The fundamental reason therefore for the identified gender pay gap is the disparity in proportion between 
female and male in term-time only, part-time, lower paid roles in schools such as lunchtime supervisors and 
teaching assistants. 
 
ODST is committed to equal opportunities and will continue to monitor the salary levels that are paid to its 
post holders to ensure that consistent principles are applied in line with the nationally negotiated guidelines.
