Gender Pay Gap Report and Statement Mar 2018 

Diversity and inclusion are at the core of our values and commitment to excellence.  We know that excellence can 
only be achieved when this diverse network of people works collaboratively in their ideas and perspectives toward 
a common goal. Newly Weds Foods Ltd fosters this  kind of workplace atmosphere that leads to  success for both 
the company and employee. 

People are the most important part of our  culture at Newly Weds Foods.  We offer a range of careers and seek a 
diverse group of qualified individuals  during our recruitment  process.  That approach has led to innovations and 
significant  growth  in  our  business.  Our  goal  is  for  our  employees  to  feel  they  are  respected  and  are  growing 
professionally in their careers. As our people grow, our company becomes a better workplace. 

Newly  Weds  Foods  Ltd  acknowledges  and  complies  with  the  requirement  to  publish  the  gender  pay  gap 
information  between  male  and  female  employees  as  required  by  the  Equalities  Act  2010  (Gender  Pay  Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017. 

The gender pay  gap  is the difference  in  average earnings  between men and women regardless of the  roles they 
perform. Gender pay differs  from equal pay,  which looks at the actual  pay  di fferences between people carrying 
out the same or comparable work. 

Newly Weds Foods' calculations have been carried out in accordance with the regulations using data collected on 
5th April  20 17.

Newly Weds Foods is pleased that the gender pay gap is very small. The fact that women earn slightly more than 
men  on average per hour is  a testament to our equal  pay policies. However, we acknowledge that further efforts 
may be made to address the bonus pay gap. 

I confirm that the gender pay gap data contained in  this report is  accurate.
