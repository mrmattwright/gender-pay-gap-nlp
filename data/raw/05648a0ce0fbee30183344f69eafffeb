It’s important to remember that the gender pay gap reporting figure is different from equal pay, which has been against the law since 1970.  Gender pay gap reporting assesses levels of equality in the workplace in terms of male and female participation by understanding the difference in average earnings of men and women across the entire organisation, including their bonuses.              316 Employees     316 Employees across 3 sites  116 Female Employees  200 Male Employees   “We are committed to diversity and equality of both opportunity and benefit within Aimia.  The reasons for this are obvious. The people making decisions in our business need to reflect our customer and consumer base.”  – Glenn Hudson, Managing Director              Aimia's Commitment to Treating People Equally    At Aimia we are committed to treating our people equally, regardless of their age, disability, gender, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership or pregnancy and maternity.  Our pay gap figure shows, on average our male colleagues are paid 24.41% more than the average for our female colleagues.  This gap is due entirely to the relative number of men and women at management levels within the business and is not a result of any disparity for colleagues doing the same job.  As with many manufacturing businesses we have traditionally employed more females in our front line operations. With the vast majority (77%) of our employees having 10 or more years service, our volume of recruitment is relatively low which limits our ability to rapidly re-engineer our profile.  At more senior levels 25% of our Board of Directors are female which is in line with government guidelines.
