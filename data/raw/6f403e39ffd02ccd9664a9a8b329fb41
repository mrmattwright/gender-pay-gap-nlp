“I believe that the gender pay 
inequality isn’t just a societal issue - 
equality beneﬁts us all, especially a 
company’s bottom line. WBC 
(Women's Business Council) 
estimates that equalising women’s 
productivity and employment to that 
of men could lead to a 35 percent 
increase in the UK’s GDP - that’s 
almost £600bn. By recognising that  
women should not, and will not, be 
discriminated against through their 
paychecks is an important and 
crucial step on the path towards a 
fairer UK.”

Taking Action

Brightstar is committed to reducing our gender pay gap. It is clear our gap is driven 
by a lower proportion of female people in the upper quartile. Brightstar is  
addressing the gap through co-ordinated initiatives including:

Developing our ﬂexible working practices creating a thriving
environment for a sustainable and diverse workforce.

Creating foundations for a new generation of female and male leaders
through a targeted training and development programme.

Focus on developing talent through active mentoring and support.
Allowing our people demonstrating high potential the opportunity to
progress to senior positions through fast-track development plans.
 
Create opportunities for cross company business networking
