The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s mean and median earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is represented as a percentage, where a positive number is a pay gap in favour of men, and a negative number is a pay gap in favour of women.  The University of Buckingham’s Gender Pay Gap Report is based on data from March 2018, made up of 698 employees of which 373 (53.5%) were Female, and 325 (46.5%) were Male. It primarily measures the differences in hourly mean and median earnings and in bonus pay. In keeping with the statutory data requirements, the report covers:   The Mean Hourly Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Median Hourly Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Mean Bonus Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Median Bonus Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The proportion (%) of women and men who received Bonus Pay  The proportion (%) of women and men on 4 equal population quartiles.      Gross Hourly Rate of Pay  Male  Female  Difference    Mean  £24.64  £19.50  21%    Median  £23.58  £14.82  37%        Bonus Pay  Male  Female  Difference    Mean  £-  £-  0%    Median  £-  £-  0%    Proportion of Employees receiving a bonus  0%  0%  0%        Quartiles (Gross Hourly Rate of Pay)  Male  Female    £0.00 to £9.52  45%  55%    £9.53 to £17.46  30%  70%    £17.47 to £34.74  52%  48%    £34.75 to £117.65  56%  44%     With reference to Quartile 2, this skew is illustrative of a significant proportion of female employees in junior or administrative roles. This quartile is also influenced by the majority of part time roles across the university being predominantly occupied by women.  Initiatives Helping to Address Our Gender Pay Gap  Below are some examples of action the University has taken and continue to take to address the Gender Pay Gap.  Promoting Gender Equality  The University is not currently subscribed to the Athena SWAN Charter, primarily due to its small size, the Diversity and Inclusion Group are working to implement the principles of monitoring female career progression through academic, support staff and student experiences. In time this will provide the necessary evidence base to enter the Athena SWAN Charter.  Family Friendly Support  Positive policies have been introduced around adoption leave, flexible working, maternity guides and policy and the paternity policy. Find out more about our Family Friendly initiatives in the University Policies & Procedures [Intranet] .  Transparent Promotion Processes  In response to evidence suggesting reticence on the part of women to apply for promotion, the University has implemented or is implementing initiatives such as:   Ensuring that promotion panel members are representative of the academic workforce  Unconscious Bias training for panel members  Promotion workshops, led by recently promoted staff and panel members – with some sessions ring-fenced for women  Developing online resources including case studies linked to career paths, drawn from across the protected characteristics, sharing tips   Training, Development and Networking   Assisting performance improvement and also engagement / enablement through recognition, achieved by providing detailed action plans, informed sharing of knowledge and experience and training in specific skills  Formal recognition of good teaching skills following the HEA Fellowship principles  Support function staff encouraged to follow professional and trade career paths such as the Association of University Administrators (AUA) competency approach which includes skills related to communication, people management, customer service, results orientation, and problem-solving  Re-defining job-related development paths, in, for example, information technology, marketing, HR, payroll, pensions, finance, facilities, health and safety, student support, librarianship, trade skills, etc.   Valuing comments  The University invites all staff to join the discussion about the causes and solutions to the gender pay gap:   What further analysis would help us understand the causes of the gender pay gap?  What can we do to improve current initiatives/policies to close the gender pay gap?  What potential new activity could be introduced that would contribute to reducing the gender pay gap?
