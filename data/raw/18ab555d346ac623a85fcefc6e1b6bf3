ABBVIE: GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

At AbbVie, we are committed to building talent and we strive to ensure that all colleagues reach their full potential. 
As a global organisation, we continuously benchmark our total rewards practices internally and externally to ensure 
fairness and equality.
We welcome the introduction of mandatory Gender Pay Gap reporting as this provides an opportunity for greater 
transparency and more meaningful conversations regarding equality across the organisation.

HOW IS THE GENDER PAY GAP 
CALCULATED? 
Mean and median pay and quartile pay bands are based on 
data from April 2017 calculating ordinary pay and bonus pay. 
Companies need to provide a report on both and there is 
specific guidance from government on what is in scope:
ORDINARY PAY includes salary plus other types of pay such 
as allowances and long service awards. Car allowances are 
included in this calculation, but company fleet vehicles are not.
BONUS PAY includes any additional pay outside of the 
above, for example annual bonus, sales commission and Long 
Term Incentives.

THE DIFFERENCE IN BONUS PAY 

We are proud that every colleague at AbbVie is eligible to receive a 
bonus each year.
Our reward practices are related to achievement against targets and 
are aligned with a scaled bonus plan based on seniority of role. Our 
demographic with more women than men in the lower paid quartiles 
creates a gap.

UNDERSTANDING THE GAP

There are more women at every level of the organisation, but particularly in the 
lower pay quartiles. This is what drives AbbVie’s pay gap.
Men and women are broadly equally represented in AbbVie’s upper pay 
quartile(M 46% and F 54%). Women are more strongly represented in the lower 
pay quartile (M 22% and F 78%). The high proportion of women in the lower pay 
quartile drives a gap under the official Gender Pay Reporting methodology.
As part of our analysis, we simulated what our pay gap would look like if we had a 
50:50 gender split across the entire organisation. If this were the case our gender 
pay gap would be approximately 1%.

“GENDER PAY GAP” REPORTING AND “EQUAL PAY” REFER TO 
TWO DISTINCT ISSUES:

1.  GENDER PAY GAP is the difference in average (mean 
and median) pay of men and women, regardless of role, across 
an organisation. From April 2017 it became a legal requirement 
for UK employers with more than 250 staff to publish this data 
annually. It is expressed as a percentage difference between the 
mean or median figures for each gender. 

2. EQUAL PAY means that men and women in the same 

employment performing equal work must receive equal pay. It is 
a legal requirement as set out in the Equality Act 2010. 

OUR COMMITMENTS

We are confident that any variation in pay across genders at AbbVie is based on the distribution of our demographic 
rather than any underlying issues regarding equal pay. We are committed to continuing to actively monitor and 
manage our payment practices to ensure that this remains fair and equitable by:

•  CONTINUING TO MONITOR 

•  TALKING ABOUT GENDER 

•  OUR BUSINESS LEADERS 

OUR ANNUAL REWARD 
PROCESS TO ENSURE IT

BIAS-FREE.

PAY OPENLY AND 
TRANSPARENTLY, WHILE 
CONTINUING TO REVIEW 
AND BENCHMARK OUR

INTEGRITY.

The data contained in this gender pay gap report is calculated based on a snap-shot of our UK payroll employees on 
5 April 2017. It includes analyses required by HM Government and further analyses we have undertaken to better 
understand the issue.
