We have a culturally rich working environment, with 37 different nationalities already represented, and this brings a wealth of skills and experience that is essential in tackling the most challenging problems in science and engineering. We could however do even better to attract and retain the very best people with STEM – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – backgrounds, an area that is affected by gender imbalance.  This is reflected in our own statistics, with 78% of our employees being male, as well as a clear lack of women in senior roles, so we have much to address. Diamond has a mean gender pay gap of 12.1% and we are working hard to rectify this, so that women are better represented at all levels of the organisation.  As a state-of-the-art facility, we have the highest aspirations in all appropriate aspects, and recognise that there is still much to be done to improve the gender pay gap for our organisation and across the sector. In 2018, we will be focussing on:    The review of the recruitment and selection processes as well as behaviours with a view to introduce fairer ways to support the recruitment, progression and retention of women at senior leadership levels.  The identification of the specific barriers that disadvantage certain groups of people from progressing in our workplace led by our Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Manager.  The provision of training for all our staff to mitigate bias by using expertise from leaders in the field.    We will review our approach on an ongoing basis to ensure it continues to be as effective as possible.  Andrew Harrison CEO Diamond Light Source        Gender pay gap is the difference between the average rates of pay for men and women. It reflects broad trends in employment and salaries at an organisation, rather than comparing individuals.  It’s not the same as equal pay , which is the legal requirement to pay people the same rate for the same work.  All UK employers with more than 250 staff are legally required to publish gender pay gap data by April 2018.      Download our report here .                              What we are doing to close the gap   Flexibility –We offer generous family friendly and flexible working practices and are committed to introducing more.  Diversity –We are building on the Athena Swan Bronze Award we obtained in 2016 and recently joined the Government’s disability confident scheme as part of our wider Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) programme led by a dedicated professional.  Reward & Recognition – We are reviewing reward, pay and grading policies within Diamond to ensure they are fit for purpose and that any barriers are identified and addressed to ensure fairness and consistency in recognition, career and pay progression.  Recruitment & Selection – We are developing a strong employer brand to broaden our audience and implementing systems to remove barriers and tap into a more diverse pool of candidates where possible.  Learning & Development – We have recently enhanced our management training provision to include the benefits of a diverse workforce, in addition we have increased our staff development provision to include mentoring, e-learning and other opportunities.  Outreach – Each year we welcome just under 7,000 visitors to the facility giving them the chance to view the engineering and science we deliver. We focus on inspiring everyone to value STEM, and in particular, make sure that we highlight female role models, for example, to ensure better gender balance for these subjects.
