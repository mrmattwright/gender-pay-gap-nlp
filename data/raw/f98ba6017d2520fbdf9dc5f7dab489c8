Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 – Outlook Care 

 
Introduction: 
 
The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 requires 
organisations employing more than 250 people to undertake Gender Pay Reporting and 
publish the results on both the Company’s and governments (prescribed) website within one 
calendar year of April 5th 2017. 

Gender  
Pay Gap 

Outlook Care’s report covers the “snapshot” date of 5 April 2017 and comprises of 
calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in 
our organisation, on that date. 

Outlook Care’s workforce by gender: 
Outlook Care is a diverse organisation with a predominantly female workforce.  As at 5 April 
2017 the workforce comprised 120 males & 517 females (18.84% males and 81.16% 
females).  Skills for Care report that the care sector as a whole in 2017 comprised 82% 
female and 18% male staff. 
 
Mean Gender Pay Gap: 
As at 5 April 2017 average (mean) hourly pay for males was £10.26 and average (mean) 
hourly pay for females was £9.19. 
This means that Outlook’s mean gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 was 10.43% - ie: mean 
pay for males was 10.43% more than mean pay for females. 
 
The mean average pay is calculated by adding up the pay of all in the group and dividing this 
by the number of people in the group. 
 
Median Gender Pay Gap: 
As at 5 April 2017 median hourly pay for males was £8.28 
Median hourly pay for females was £7.95 
This gives a Median Gender Pay Gap of 3.99% on the reporting date of 5 April 2017 - ie: 
median pay for males was 3.99% more than median pay for females. 
 
The median pay is arrived at by placing the hourly pay for all in the group in order of amount, 
the mid-point value in the group being the median. 
 
Bonus Pay Gap  
We are required to report our bonus pay gap.  
During the reporting period preceding April 2017 the proportion of males in the workforce 
receiving a bonus was 0% and the proportion of females in the workforce who received a 
bonus was 0.39%  
As no male staff received a bonus we cannot calculate a mean or median bonus pay gap.

Gender  
Pay Gap 

This shows a relatively proportionate split between male and female employees at each level 
within the pay scale when compared to the overall split of 18.84% males and 81.16% 
females. There is though, a progressively higher percentage of male staff in higher salary 
bands. 

Conclusions and Resultant actions: 
Outlook Care does have a gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is largely driven by the fact 
that the proportion of men in senior higher-paid roles is higher than the proportion of men in 
lower paid roles, a pattern common to most of the UK.  Outlook Care’s median gender pay 
gap of 3.99% is lower than the UK’s median gender pay gap of 18% (as reported by the 
government Equalities Office in November 2016).  Meaningful sector comparison was not 
possible at the reporting date due to a lack of published information; however the average 
median gender pay gap based on the data provided by 15 organisations (up to October 
2017) was 1.99%. 

Outlook Care’s Board of Management aspire to eliminate any gender pay gap and reaffirm 
their commitment to treating all employees equally regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, 
age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender 
reassignment or disability.  

The Board of management have already directed that staff will receive the same rate of pay 
when undertaking equivalent work and a grading structure is in place that underpins this.  

We have a variety of initiatives and policies in place whose aim to ensure equality and 
fairness and in turn reduce the gender pay gap. These include an Equality Policy and 
supporting action plan, family friendly policies such as Job sharing, Home and Remote 
Working, and flexible working arrangements.  Learning and Development initiatives also 
encourage staff to develop and move in to higher paid roles. We recognise Trade Unions 
and the role they can play in supporting staff and highlighting any potential discrimination. 

Outlook Care will work to eliminate its gender pay gap. The HR team will review current 
recruitment and development practices to ensure females are encouraged into higher paid 
roles and all recruiters are suitably trained to recognise the potential they may have for 
unconscious bias in recruitment decision making. Furthermore Management Development 
Programmes and Career Development Programmes will be explored to retain talent and this 
should assist in redressing the pay gap. 

I, Piotr Rejek, Chief Executive, confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
