                 The Aunt Bessie’s Way  When it comes to helping farmers and sourcing ingredients, we think it’s really important to do our bit.                     Our Food The Aunt Bessie’s Way About us  Community  Our people  Meet Our Team My Kitchen Get in Touch Log in              British and Irish beef and pork  Ethical Trading  Chocolate  Wonky Veg & Reducing Food Waste  Eggs  Our Packaging  Palm Oil  Our Ingredients  Gender Pay Report            British and Irish beef and pork  We’re proud to support British and Irish farmers, and use only British and Irish beef and pork in our recipes. We don’t use any mechanically recovered meat.               Ethical Trading  Aunt Bessie’s is driven to make great food, by good people, from good ingredients and the result is food that makes us proud. But it’s not just about the food we make; it’s about how we conduct ourselves in every aspect of our business As a trusted brand on the high street we believe our role is to reassure our customers that our products are ethically and sustainably sourced.  To do this, we must look beyond our operations to the wider supply chain. We’re committed to engage with our suppliers fairly, lawfully and source responsibly. We work closely with our suppliers to make sure they respect human rights, promote decent working conditions and improve sustainability across our supply base. The following provisions apply to all our suppliers: Employment is freely chosen; Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected; Working conditions are safe and hygienic; Child labour shall not be used; Living wages are paid; Working hours are not excessive; No discrimination is practised; Regular employment is provided; No harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed. We encourage all our suppliers to be members of Sedex, Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), is a not-for-profit membership group who’re dedicated to making supply chains more responsible and ethical.            Chocolate  We only buy sustainably sourced cocoa and cocoa products.            Wonky Veg & Reducing Food Waste  Vegetables come in a whole host of different shapes and sizes, and we think they’re lovely just the way they are. To help reduce food waste, we use wonky carrots and swedes to make our delicious veg range. As long as they’re fresh and tasty, they’re good enough for us. When it comes to our tasty potato range, we don’t waste a thing. We use 100% of the potato and use the peel for animal feed. Increasing your use of frozen food can lead to a reduction in food waste, benefiting the environment and your family budget. Frozen foods keep longer than fresh refrigerated foods because the freezing process suspends the enzyme activity that causes the food to rot. Most foods can be stored for several months without losing quality.            Eggs  We’re really pleased to say that we don’t use any eggs from hens that live in cages. To make sure we have enough eggs to keep this promise, we buy from carefully selected flocks. We also have the Good Egg award under our belt, which we’re really proud about. The Good Egg Award means that Aunt Bessie’s only use Cage-Free eggs (or egg products) in our products.. To date, more than 40 million laying hens are set to benefit each year because of these policies. You can read lots more about the Good Egg Award here . To make sure our hens are as happy as can be, we go and visit them on their farms when we can. We check they are well fed with room to roam, spread their wings and scratch to their hearts content.            Our Packaging  By 2025, 100% of our packaging will be made from recycled packaging and/or be recyclable/compostable in the home. We’re making good progress with this and are pleased to say we are halfway there. Where we use cardboard packaging for our food, we only use sustainably-sourced board from factories that are approved by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).            Palm Oil  100% of the palm oil we use in our food is sustainably sourced in accordance with the principles of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).            Our Ingredients  It’s really important to us that people love the food we make. As such, we make sure that our tasty products are made using great quality ingredients, and are as close to homemade as possible. We don’t use artificial colours or flavours, and we never put MSG into the food we make.
