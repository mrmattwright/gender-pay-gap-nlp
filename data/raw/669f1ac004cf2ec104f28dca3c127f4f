21 March, 2018 

 
 
INS has voluntarily chosen to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 
 
This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average 
earnings of men and women in our organisation. 
 
As part of this reporting we are publishing the results on our own website and on 
www.gov.uk. 
 
INS is a subsidiary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) a non-departmental 
public body. NDA are publishing their own Gender Pay Gap Report and this includes data 
from all of the businesses in the NDA Group. The NDA Group report can be found here:  
http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-pay-gap-report-and-data-2017  
 
These results are useful for INS because they mean we can assess: 
 

-  The levels of gender equality in our workplace 
-  The balance of male and female employees at different levels 
-  How effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded 

 
The challenge for INS, just as it is for the entire country, is to eliminate the gender pay gap.  
We’re committed to building an organisation that is equal, diverse and embrace differences 
in background, opinions and thoughts. 
 
To do that we’ll be focusing on the following areas: 
 
- 
- 
- 
-  Building a culture of improving innovation and challenging the status quo 
-  Enhancing leadership in this area 
 
The INS Gender Pay Gap data is set out over the page.
