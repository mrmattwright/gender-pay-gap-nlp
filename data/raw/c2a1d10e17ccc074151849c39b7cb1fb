Staff regularly receive training so that they understand their legal obligations and this is embedded in their day to day work.  As part of these legal obligations we are publishing this data in response to our responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which require us to report on a number of metrics as of 31st March in a given year. The gender pay gap is the difference between the average pay (expressed as both the mean and median) of men and women expressed as a percentage and should not be confused with equal pay.  2017 Metrics  Mean gender pay gap - Women’s pay is 3.63% lower Median gender pay gap - Women’s pay is 5.69% lower The mean gender bonus pay gap - n/a no bonuses paid The median gender bonus pay gap - n/a no bonuses paid   The proportions of male and female employees in each quartile pay band. (This is the percentage of men and women there were in each quarter of our payroll on 31st March 2017 with quartile 1 being the lowest paid staff and quartile 4 being the highest paid).      Quartile    Men    Women      Quartile 1    39.71%    60.29%      Quartile 2    44.93%    55.07%      Quartile 3    39.13%    60.87%      Quartile 4    47.06%    52.94%      The overall profile of our staff population on 31st March 2017 was 42.7% men and 57.3% women.  Context  The University’s commitment to equality extends into how we approach Equal Pay, and we operate a grade structure based on the New JNCHES pay scale. All roles outside our most senior staff have their roles evaluated using the HERA job evaluation scheme, and the salary of senior roles are set by our Remuneration Committees which consider a range of metrics and external data when setting pay levels.  The HERA scores are mapped to our grading structure to ensure that we remunerate staff fairly for the same role, like work and work of equal value regardless of their role within the institution. This ensures that we comply with the Equality Act 2010 and do not pay people unequally due to a protected characteristic such as their gender.  The grading structure contains a number of spine points within each grade band; and staff are usually appointed to the bottom of the grade band. Advancement through the grade band is based on a number of set criteria. Under this framework staff who have held a role for a longer period are more highly remunerated within that grade band for their work; and this remuneration reflects the experience that they have gained in undertaking their duties.  A number of factors have been identified which have impacted on data:   On 31st March 2017 a number of female (and no male) student ambassadors were working. Student ambassadors are ambassadorial roles with a limited role profile and paid on our lowest spine point. The number of ambassadors engaged on that day has impacted on the profile of the lowest quartile and the overall calculation of the average and median pay. Given our institutional size the impact of such staff working is greater than it would be with a larger institution.  Progression within bands is impacted by tenure in role and this is a factor which has influenced the calculations. A spinal point equates to around a 2.5% difference in salary from the point below. At the date of calculation we had more males at higher levels within their grade than females which has contributed towards this gap.  There is variation of the pay gap within the quartile bands when the pay gap is analysed on this basis, with men being paid less than women within the second quartile when considering both the mean and median pay gap. Within the top quartile women are paid 0.81% less than men.   Whilst these factors do contribute to the difference in salaries, this is not to suggest that as an institution we are complacent. A complete eradication of a pay gap (with either gender being paid more) may be impossible to achieve with staff turnover and a grade band structure; however we will continue to monitor the detail behind any reported figures and take action where appropriate. Prior to publication these figures have been reported to our Senior Management Team and will be considered by our Equality Diversity and Inclusion Committee.
