Alphabet (GB) Limited
2017 Gender pay gap report

A BMW Group Company

Introduction

Diversity is the engine of our success – today and in the future – because a diverse workforce is an 
important force for innovation. The BMW Group is convinced that diversity is crucial to our ability to 
perform effectively and will ensure the long-term success of our Company. 

The full Board of Management of the BMW Group established a commitment to diversity as part of 
the Company’s human resources and sustainability strategy. In 2011, the BMW Group signed up to the 
Diversity Charter in Germany and committed itself to create a working environment free of prejudices.

At Alphabet (GB) Limited, we are working hard on a corporate culture that promotes tolerance, mutual 
respect and equality of opportunity.

In this report, we provide our gender pay gap information, identify the reasons behind the gap and our 
plans to help close it.

We support the UK Government’s drive for companies to be more transparent on gender pay issues 
and confirm that the data reported is accurate and in line with The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017.

Our measurement

At the time of the reporting period, Alphabet (GB) Limited 
employed 409 people at its site in Farnborough.

The Gender Pay Gap Reporting Regulations require all 
employers with 250 or more employees in the UK to report 
their gender pay gap.

The figures reported are based on calculations set out in the 
Regulations and must be reported every year. 

The gender pay gap does not measure equal pay, which 
relates to what women and men are paid for performing 
equal work.

The principle of equal pay is enshrined in law and we are 
committed to ensuring ongoing compliance with our equal 
pay obligations.

Definitions

The principle of equal pay is:
The right for men and women to receive equal pay  
for equal work.

The gender pay gap is:
The difference in the average pay and bonuses of all 
men and women across an organisation, irrespective  
of their role or level in the organisation.

Our findings

Alphabet (GB) Limited employs 
approximately an equal number of  
men and women. However, analysis of 
our gender pay gap shows that there 
are more men in senior, higher-paid roles 
and more females in lower-paid roles. 

The bonus pay gap relates to the 
structure of our bonus arrangements, 
where bonus potential is set as a 
percentage of salary, which increases 
with grade. The higher number of men 
in the higher grades and therefore 
earning higher bonus values, has a 
significant effect on our bonus pay gap.

Alphabet (GB) Limited is an equal pay 
employer focused on supporting every 
employee to reach their full potential. 
We are confident that men and women 
are paid equally for doing equivalent 
jobs throughout our business.

Closing the gap

Alphabet (GB) Limited values the contribution of all 
employees and we seek to grow and retain a diverse 
workforce who will help deliver our strategic goals.

We are committed to delivering existing and  
new initiatives to improve our ability to attract, 
engage and develop women and to achieve more  
of a gender balance.

Many of our employees benefit from a flexible 
working environment which enables a better work-
life balance and allows employees greater flexibility 
in managing their time commitments. We are 
working to encourage more flexible working across 
all levels, including the flexibility to accommodate 
job sharing and part time working. More than 3% 
of our employees work less than full time hours 
and these are spread across all the salary quartiles, 
including our management grades.

We are investing in providing support to our 
employees to build confidence, improve internal 
networks and enhance their career development 
within the organisation, through a range of 
activities and initiatives.

We are adapting our induction and leadership 
training programmes to highlight and address the 
issue of unconscious bias during the recruitment 
and selection process, and beyond.

We are also undertaking an extensive process and 
practice review to ensure succession planning, 
performance management, recruitment and 
training programmes all support a culture of 
increased diversity and inclusion. 

This is supported by our membership of the 
Employers' Network for Equality and Inclusion.

“Moving to a business that affords 
me the time and space to learn, to 
trust my intuition, and to have the 
courage of my conviction, has been 
the biggest breakthrough in my 
career so far. Emotional intelligence 
is fast becoming the new ‘strategic 
thinking’ when it comes to people 
leadership. And it’s the most 
powerful tool we have to engage, 
encourage and deliver the best for 
our people and our customers.”
