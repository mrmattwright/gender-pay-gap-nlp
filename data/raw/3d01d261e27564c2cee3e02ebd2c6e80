SCOTIABANK LONDON
2017 GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

Our commitment
Scotiabank is committed to a diverse, inclusive environment that allows employees to reach their fullest potential.

What are we reporting on? 
This report provides the required 
gender pay gap data across 
our entire U.K. organisation 
(“Scotiabank London”). The data 
in this report is based on the 5th 
April 2017 snapshot date. 

What is the data showing?
In the gender pay gap reporting regulations, gender pay gap is defined as the 
difference between the earnings of male and female employees, expressed 
relative to male employee earnings (for example, women are paid X% less than 
men). This is different from equal pay, as equal pay requires that men and women 
who carry out the same or similar jobs, or work of the same value, are paid the 
same.

About Scotiabank London 
Scotiabank London is part of 
Scotiabank Global Banking and 
Markets, the wholesale banking 
division of Scotiabank. Overall, 
the business employs just over 
300 people in London, with 
women accounting for 35 per 
cent of the population in a 
wide range of roles, levels and 
departments. 

The pay and bonus gap, as shown in the data below, primarily results from an 
uneven distribution of women across each pay quartile of the business. This is 
because there are some departments and roles where we have few or no women. 
This is why we are committed to continuing to build a truly inclusive workplace 
with more women at every decision-making table, and in all settings across the 
Bank.

Employee demographics
Scotiabank London is comprised of two distinct business groups: revenue generating (RG) product groups and operational 
and support (OS) functions.  Within each group, there are 10 job levels, which vary widely in terms of responsibilities, skills 
and experience. Remuneration for all roles and levels, whether in RG groups or OS functions, is competitive within the local 
market. It is the gender distribution between the two groups that impacts our gender pay gap. The following chart shows 
the headcount split, overall and by group:

The charts below show the distribution of male and female employees across four equally-sized quartiles of the business, 
dividing the employee population into four groups from lowest to highest paid. The data is indicative of the fact that 
Scotiabank London has more men in senior, highly-paid positions than women.

How are we progressing?

At Scotiabank London, we understand that in an ever-evolving 
and developing world, diverse teams lead to improved 
performance and a more inclusive work environment. As 
we continue to build a better Bank, we are committed to 
continuing to build a truly inclusive workplace with more 
women at every decision-making table, and in all settings 
across the Bank. 

Scotiabank is committed to paying our employees fairly 
and equitably relative to their roles, levels, experience and 
performance. We regularly review our compensation structure 
and practices to ensure there are no gender or other biases 
that impact remuneration.

In recent years, we have implemented some key initiatives 
that focus on gender diversity to help us attract, hire, develop, 
promote and retain top talent, supporting our goal of building 

a foundation that creates opportunities for more women in 
senior and more highly-paid positions as our workforce shifts 
and changes. 

Some of the initiatives that we have undertaken to close the 
gap are:
Formation of a U.K. Diversity & Inclusion Committee;
• 
•  Development of new recruitment protocols - female 

representation on every interview panel and each job 
vacancy must include a diverse pool of both male and 
female candidates;
Establishment of a management objective to increase 
the percentage of women in front-office positions;
Launch of an Enhanced Maternity Pay Policy and an 
onsite Wellness Room to support new mothers; and
Creation of a mentorship programme with a goal of 
50:50 participation between female and male participants.
