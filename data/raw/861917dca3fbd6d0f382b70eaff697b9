According to the Equal Opportunities Commission the average full time salary pay gap for women is 17%.  The Gallery is committed to sharing its gender pay gap data and using this to underpin strategies and practices to ensure fair and equal pay in all areas of work. Throughout 2017 and 2018, important work is progressing to review the Gallery’s overall pay structure, which will ensure that all jobs offer equal pay for men and women.  2017–18 gender pay gap data   Difference in mean hourly rate of pay – mean: 14.4%  Difference in median hourly rate pf pay – median: 15.2%  Difference in mean bonus pay – mean: 100%  Difference in median bonus pay – median: 100%  Percentage of employees who received bonus pay: Male 0.3%, Female 0%  Employees by pay quartile: Upper quartile: Male 38%, Female 62% Upper middle quartile: Male 36%, Female 64% Lower middle quartile: Male 21%, Female 79% Lower quartile: Male 21%, Female 79%   Points 1 and 2: the Gallery notes this position and is currently reviewing its pay structure for implementation during 2018–19.  Points 3 and 4: the bonus payment during 2017–18 was restricted to a single employee.  Point 6: the Gallery notes this position and is reviewing its recruitment and selection procedures for 2018–19 to enhance diversity and to ensure more even distribution across the entire workforce.  Employment policies and procedures  The Gallery has for many years recognised the scope for potential discrimination in employment practices. The Human Resources Department reviews policies, procedures and practices not only to eliminate unlawful and unfair discrimination, but also to promote equality and inclusiveness for all.  The Gallery consults the trade unions as part of the development of key policies. Policies and procedures are available to staff in the Staff Handbook or on the internal network as appropriate.  Recruitment  The Gallery aims to attract and retain people who are the best in their field, with the right skills and competences, and with a range of diverse backgrounds.  As part of the improvement in monitoring arrangements, the data referred to in the section concerning our workforce profile will be collected and analysed to enable better monitoring of our recruitment processes.  Flexible working  The Gallery Flexible Working Policy is open to all colleagues. It is recognised that it is not just working parents and carers of adults who have responsibilities and interests outside of the workplace.  Our flexible working policy allows all colleagues with the requisite qualifying time in our employ to request to work flexibly, regardless of their personal circumstances.  The Gallery seeks to accommodate requests for flexible working arrangements, wherever business needs enable this. Over the past four years the Gallery has an average maternity return rate of 80%. According to the Department of Trade and Industry the national average maternity return rate is 60%.  Harassment  Tackling harassment is an important element of ensuring equality. The Gallery is committed to providing an environment in which colleagues are treated with dignity and in which genuine complaints concerning behaviour or treatment may be raised without fear of reprisals.  Our bullying and harassment statement, which is part of our terms and conditions of employment, makes clear that harassment or bullying will not be tolerated. Additionally, our disciplinary rules make clear that action may be taken against any colleague who harasses or bullies. Any colleague found to have victimised another for complaining, for supporting a colleague or for giving evidence about harassment may also be subject to disciplinary action.  The Gallery will be reviewing its policies to ensure adequate provision is made for the raising and investigation of complaints. Additionally, as part of the improvement in monitoring arrangements, we will report on grievances brought by employees including those relating to discrimination, harassment or victimisation on the grounds of sex. Confidentiality will be maintained and individuals will not be identified in any such reports.
