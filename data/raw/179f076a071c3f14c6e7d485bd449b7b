Gender Pay Gap Compliance Statement 

(For snapshot date 5 April 2017) 

The following statement shows the gender pay gap and bonus gap at the Canal and River Trust 
at the “snapshot date” - i.e. 5 April 2017 (pay) and in the 12 months reference period to 5 April 
2017 (bonus). 

The pay and bonus gaps reflect the composition of our workforce, and are due to there being a 
larger proportion of men than women working in operational and maintenance roles with typically 
lower rates of pay, alongside proportionately more women in higher-paying professional and 
management roles. 

We firmly believe in gender equality across all aspects of our employment, including pay, and 
welcome the opportunity to present our information transparently in this way. 

1.  Our mean gender pay gapi – As at 5 April 2017, the Trust employed 1,694 members of 

staff, comprising 1,236 men and 458 women. This equates to 73% men and 27% women. 
Our mean (average) gender pay gap at the Trust is -3.6%. This means that on average 
women are paid 3.6% more than men at the Trust. 

2.  Our median gender pay gapii is -13.8%.  So, the woman who is in the middle of the range 

when women are ranked by salary was paid 13.8% more than the man in the middle of 
the range when men are ranked by salary. 

3.  Our proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment in 2016/17 is as set out 

below:  

% of males that receive a bonus 
% of females that receive a bonus 

39.6% 
44.0% 

4.  Our mean bonus gender pay gap is +3.6%. This means that - of those who receive a 

bonus - the average bonus for a man is 3.6% more than the average bonus for a woman.  
This is a slight distortion of the underlying position because the measure of ‘bonus’ we are 
required to use combines our annual bonus award (in recognition of their performance in 
the previous year) with the small one-off awards we give through our ‘thank you’ staff 
recognition scheme for specific examples of good service or extra effort during the year. 

We think it is more helpful to consider the bonus payments by gender excluding these 
much smaller Thank You awards, which distort the mean bonus payment calculation - 
especially as 32% of women at the Trust received at least one Thank You award in 
2016/17 compared to 24% of men. 

Excluding Thank You awards, our annual bonus scheme awarded bonuses to 23% of 
both men and women, with a mean bonus gender pay gap of -7%. That is, for the larger 
annual bonus award alone, women were paid a 7% larger bonus than men on average, 
consistent with the trend for overall pay. 

5.  Our median bonus gender pay gap +34.5%.  This means that of those that receive a 

bonus of some sort, the median bonus payment paid to men is 34.5% higher than that 
paid to women. 

This measure, as in 4 above, is distorted by the inclusion of our Thank You staff 
recognition scheme.  The greater percentage of women receiving these small awards 
(32% vs. 24% of men) draws the median bonus payment for women down.  For the 
annual bonus award only, the gender bonus pay gap is -25%, which means that the 
bonus award given to the middle-ranking woman is 25% higher than that awarded to the 
middle-ranking man (when including only those receiving a bonus). 

6.  The proportion of males and females in each pay ‘quartile’, when ranked in order, is 

shown below. There Upper band includes the top 25% of employees when ranked by pay, 
and so on. Women are slightly over-represented in both the Upper and Lower pay 
quartiles.

I confirm that the above data is accurate.
