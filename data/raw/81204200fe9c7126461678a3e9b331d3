Here in Statoil, we are committed to providing an inclusive workplace where our people can be them-
selves and achieve their full potential.  We welcome the UK Government’s requirement for companies 
with over 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap. In the UK, our gender pay gap report covers 
307 employees of Statoil (U.K.) Limited.1)
We  will  voluntarily  disclose  figures  for  the  108  employees  of  Statoil  Production  (UK)  Limited.2)  The  
report includes local employees and those on expatriate assignments outside the UK. All data is from 
April 2017 as per the reporting requirements.

WHAT WE ARE MEASURING

requirement 

The  government’s 
for  gender  pay  gap  
reporting  takes  the  payments  to  all  men  in  the  organisation  
and  compares  it  with  the  payments  to  all  women.  This  
includes all payments such as base pay, shift pay, offshore allow-
ances, car allowances, all expatriate payments, and other allow-
ances paid in our April 2017 payroll. It does not include overtime. 

The  gender  pay  gap  is  not  a  measure  of  equal  pay, 
and  in  Statoil  UK we  are  confident  that we  pay  men  and  
women equally and fairly for similar jobs. We are committed to  
ensuring  that  this  remains  the  case  through  our  salary  
review, 
recruitment  and  development  
processes.

OUR INDUSTRY 
...has always been predominantly staffed by men, due in part to a shortage of women studying STEM (science, technology,  
engineering and maths) subjects and entering professions such as engineering and trading.  As a result we have a higher 
proportion of men than women in Statoil UK, which heavily dominates our gender pay gap figures. Our pay quartiles  
(number of men and women in each quarter of our pay distribution) illustrates the gender split in Statoil UK and Statoil 
Production UK. Overall the quartiles show a lower proportion of women to men and highlights the shortage of women in 
higher paid senior roles. Our bonus gap is driven by fewer women in roles such as trading where higher bonuses are paid.

We believe that a diverse and inclusive workplace is essential to the success of the business. We will address how to improve 
diversity and inclusion in the UK organisation, including how to increase the number of women entering the organisation and 
growing to senior positions. To make this happen, we will be taking various actions. We will engage closely with UK employees 
with the help of a leader in the field of Diversity & Inclusion to understand how the current working practices and environment 
may impact inclusivity in Statoil UK. We will examine areas such as recruitment and company policies to ensure they promote 
diversity and inclusion. We will ensure a balance of diversity in our key leadership activities.  In early 2018, we incorporated 
inclusive leadership training into our leadership development programmes and will continue to build on this.

In addition, we are passionate about encouraging children and young people into STEM subjects and have sponsorship  
initiatives across the UK addressing this, through our Heroes of Tomorrow sponsorship initiative. 

We confirm that Statoil UK’s gender pay gap calculations are accurate and meet the requirements of UK Government’s regulations.
