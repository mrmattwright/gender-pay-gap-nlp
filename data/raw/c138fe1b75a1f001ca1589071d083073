Overview  This document reports on the gender pay gap at Amnesty International’s International Secretariat in a spirit of transparency and progress. Gender equality is a critical component of the human rights issues we work on and we are committed to building an organization that reflects those values internally as well as externally. That is why alongside publishing the details around our gender pay gap, we are setting out plans to address it.  The UK’s Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 require us to publish our gender pay gap statistics for UK employees annually from 2018. However, Amnesty International’s International Secretariat has taken the decision to also include our regional offices in this analysis.  2.What is the gender pay gap?  The gender pay gap is described as:   the difference in the mean pay of full-time equivalent (FTE) men and women, expressed as a percentage;  the difference in the median pay of FTE men and women, expressed as a percentage;  the number of FTE men and women in each of four quartile pay bands (lower, lower middle, upper middle, upper).   The gender pay gap looks at differences in the average earnings of men and women regardless of their role or seniority, which can result from a number of factors including differences in the sorts of jobs performed by men and women.  It is separate from equal pay, which focuses on the pay differences between men and women performing the same or similar work, and which our pay grade system successfully protects against.  3. Findings  3.1 All International Secretariat UK employees      International Secretariat  Median gender pay gap        5.7%      UK Median gender pay gap (as at April 2017 per ONS*)        18.4%            International Secretariat Mean gender pay gap        10.6%      UK Mean gender pay gap (as at April 2017 per ONS*)        17.4%      *: ONS: Office of National Statistics  While our pay gap at the median compares favourably to the UK national average, we are not complacent about the need to further understand the reasons for the gap and to set clear targets to further close it. Further information and analysis is set out below.  NB: In line with UK gender pay gap reporting regulations, we have published both the median and mean figures. These metrics give an idea of the distribution of pay across our organization. While the median gives the best representation of the “typical” gender difference, the mean helps to show how varied higher or lower salaries are at the top or bottom of the sample.  3.2 Number of men and women in quartile pay bands  Of the 356 UK staff, 64% are women. This is broken down across the four equally sized quartiles as follows:          % of men    % of women      1st quartile    27    73      2nd quartile    25.6    74.4      3rd quartile    34.5    65.5      4th quartile    46    54      Note that although the Senior Leadership Team are covered in the 4 th quartile, some members are employed outside the UK and are thus not included in this data.  In Amnesty International’s particular circumstances, the gender pay gap is partly attributable to the fact that women staff members tend to have fewer years of service than men. Salary levels in Amnesty are directly linked to years of service and this is illustrated by the table below showing the distribution between men and women per grades and steps. The table shows the service disparities and enables us to consider how we might influence this in order to address gender pay disparity (see “What next?” below).      Grade    Percentage of women in first 3 steps    Percentage of men in first 3 steps    Percentage of women in last 3 steps    Percentage of men in last 3 steps            Grade 1    0.0    0.0    0.0    100.0        Grade 2    37.5    62.5    25.0    75.0        Grade 3    80.8    19.2    73.7    26.3        Grade 4    75.0    25.0    76.3    23.7        Grade 5    64.3    35.7    75.0    25.0        Grade 6    55.0    45.0    50.0    50.0        Grade 7  & Senior  L’ship Team    85.7    14.3    45.5    54.5        3.3 Gender pay gaps for any bonuses paid out during the year  Amnesty International pays no bonuses to any staff members.  3.4 Regional offices (staff based outside the UK)  The implementation of our strategy to “move closer to the ground” means that almost 50% of our staff will be employed outside the UK by the end of 2017 and we have undertaken a similar analysis of the pay gap in each office employing more than 15 staff.  The data is set out in the table below.  As it is based on a statistically smaller number of staff than for the UK staff population described above, the data naturally shows larger disparities which can be influenced by one or two individuals moving between the defined quartiles (e.g. in Dakar or Johannesburg). It also shows locations where all/the majority of the management are women (e.g. in Beirut or Mexico where the gender pay gap relates to men).      Regional Office    Median gender  pay gap %      Mean gender  pay gap %          Beirut    11.6    1.02          Brussels    -0.51    -0.88          Dakar    28.27    26.23          Hong Kong    14.05    18.32          Johannesburg    10.45    27.39          Mexico City    0    -24.74          Nairobi    5    3.82      NB: a) a negative number indicates a gender pay gap in favour of women; and b) unlike for the UK, there are no national statistics for these countries to enable comparison.  4. What next?   We will work with staff, our union (Unite) and others to consider ways in which we can further decrease the pay gap, where it is relevant and appropriate to do so, and to report on actions taken.  Our first target is to monitor the reasons for women leaving in the first three years of their employment and to take steps to address this where practicable. Statistically, if the tenure of women increased by one year, the median pay gap would fall by c.50% from 5.7% to 2.9%.    The figures will be published officially in 2018 using the UK government’s template and annually thereafter. Analysis for the whole of the International Secretariat (UK and staff employed internationally) will continue to be available on amnesty.org.
