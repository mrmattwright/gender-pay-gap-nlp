(Huawei UK) has a strong long-term commitment to promoting equality and diversity in our business. The UK Government has introduced a requirement for all organisations with 250 or more employees to report their gender pay gap each year.  The company welcomes the opportunity to report its gender pay gap figures and to share our activities promoting equality and diversity. The Senior Management Team at Huawei UK recognises the value a diverse organisation brings and is committed to promoting an inclusive culture and environment where everyone can flourish regardless of gender.  Huawei UK Gender Pay  The figures below the UK Government’s requirements based on the position as at April 2017.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the hourly rate of pay of men and women expressed as a percentage of the hourly rate of the male employees. The bonus pay gap shows the difference in bonus payments paid to male and female employees expressed as a percentage of the male figures. The report also includes the proportion of male and female employees who received bonus payments in the relevant 12 month period. Overall pay distribution shows the proportion of men and women in each quartile by pay band.  Pay Gap Results:  Table 1 Mean and Median hourly gender gap and bonus gap      Mean  Median    Hourly Pay  24.28%  29.09%    Bonus Pay  34.59%  33.64%    Actual bonus payments for UK employees made in the 12 months ending 5th April 2017, as specified by the UK regulations.  Table 2 Percentage of men and women who were paid bonus pay within a 12-month period      Men  Female    Bonus  77.59%  74.63%    Table 3 Gender distribution across Huawei UK in four quartiles      Top  quartile  Upper-middle  quartile  Lower middle  quartile  Lower  quartile    Men  90.4%  88.8%  84.6%  71.8%    Women  9.6%  11.2%  15.4%  28.2%    Insights  At Huawei UK, we have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure that men and women who are undertaking the same jobs or jobs of equal value are paid the same.  Huawei UK is a performance-driven organisation and our pay and incentive strategies reflect this.  Gender plays no role in decisions taken relating to pay and benefits.  Our gender pay gap is predominantly due to the substantially more men than women are working at all levels of our business, but particularly in the more senior roles.  And those in engineering, technical and sales which are the higher paid roles. Over half of the female employees work in support functions (Legal, Finance, HR, Administration).  It is important to recognize that these factors are not unique to Huawei UK, this is a challenge facing the ICT Sector as whole, both here in the UK and elsewhere.  Our Commitment  The Senior Management Team at Huawei UK recognises the value a diverse organisation brings and is committed to promoting an inclusive culture and environment where everyone can flourish regardless of gender. We believe there is more we can do to help reduce the gender pay gap across our business, principally by encouraging more women into senior and other higher paid roles. The following are some of our initiatives:   We are planning to put in place a coaching and mentoring scheme to support women to achieve their full potential within the business;  We are looking to build partnerships with external organisations focused on promoting female representation in the workplace;  Our Graduate Recruitment and Seeds for the Future Programmes both aim to increase the proportion of female intake year on year;   Huawei UK welcomes the opportunity to regularly report our gender pay gap and the steps we plan to take towards reducing the gap.
