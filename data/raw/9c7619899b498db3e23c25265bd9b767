GENDER PAY GAP 
REPORT 2017

Introduction

Women make up less than 12% of those employed in the construction 
industry and wider industrial sectors, many of whom are in 
administration and back office roles. With increasing awareness of 
the benefits of having a diverse and gender balanced team, we have 
supported many campaigns over the years to increase the number of 
women in construction. 

Danny Sullivan Group drives the agenda by 
various means such as its Gold Partnership 
with the Supply Chain Sustainability School and 
through its 30+ Fairness, Inclusion and Respect 
(FIR) Ambassadors and STEM Ambassadors.  
We work closely with Kath Moore’s initiative 
‘Women into Construction’ in partnership with 
CITB and were recently awarded for our support 
and excellent contribution that has directly 
resulted in increased participation of women in 
the construction industry.  

As a Partner of Women into Construction, we will 
continue to create new opportunities for women 
seeking careers in the construction industry 
by supporting them with training, placements, 
mentoring and development opportunities to 
promote their success. 
 
I confirm that the gender pay gap data contained 
in this report is accurate, reliable and complete 
and has been produced in accordance with the 
guidelines published by Advisory, Conciliation 
and Arbitration Service (ACAS).
