GENDER PAY 
GAP REPORT 
2017

Introduction

As an employer, the University of Suffolk seeks to provide a safe, healthy and inspiring work 
environment, and create the conditions that allow colleagues to develop their careers and 
fulfil their potential. We do not tolerate discriminatory practice and work to deliver a positive 
environment for the conduct of all our activities. We are committed to ensuring gender equality and 
cultural diversity.  

We undertook an equal pay review during 2016, focusing on gender, ethnicity and disability. 
The review identified key factors affecting the gender pay gap. A number of steps have been taken 
to begin to address these and we continue to work to get a better understanding of the broader 
factors which contribute to pay disparity and build on our efforts to foster a secure and caring 
environment which is welcoming to all and free from prejudice and discrimination.

Overview

The University is committed to equality of opportunity and to equal pay in employment. The 
central tool in delivering this is a sector specific, nationally supported job evaluation process 
- HERA (Higher Education Role Analysis). This is based on objective criteria, free from bias and 
provides a transparent basis for the grading of all posts. With the exception of the Executive, all 
posts are aligned to a nationally negotiated, single pay spine, implemented during 2007-8 as part of 
the National Framework Agreement. 

The following analysis is based on the University’s workforce in scope as at the snapshot date of 
31 March 2017. 

Our gender balance  
at the University is:

Although this compares to the median gender pay gap data for all employees in the HE sector 
based on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings data of 14.8% 
in April 2016, the University is committed to improving its gender pay gap.

Bonus payments within the institution are only payable in very exceptional circumstances. 
One bonus payment was made during the reporting period. This was to the Vice-Chancellor in 
recognition of the University achieving HEFCE designation and independent university title. 

Work on removing the Gender Pay Gap

1.  Equal Pay Review

  An equal pay review was undertaken during 2016/17. This identified the key factors affecting the 

gender pay gap as being:

i)  The top three most senior roles within the institution are held by men, with these three posts 

excluded from the calculation, the gender pay gap in the: 
n  Mean  = 11.04% 
n  Median = 13.69%

ii)  A disproportionate number of females employed in grades 2 – 6, which pulls down the 

average female salary.

2.  Flexible Working

 

The University is committed to providing a flexible working environment for all employees 
regardless of their role and level of seniority. 

  We are a member of Working Families, and for the second year running the University of Suffolk 
has been listed in the top 30 national employers for working families. This is a reflection of our 
flexible working policies and practices.

  All of our job adverts include the statement that we consider flexible working requests for all 

our vacancies.

  We actively support women returning from maternity or adoption leave so that they feel 

supported and welcomed back into the workplace. We have a suite of family friendly policies 
which underpin this.

  We have recently committed to seeking national recognition with the Alzheimer’s Society 

as a Dementia-Friendly organisation. Amongst other actions this will include reviewing and 
developing policies and processes that enable the needs of University staff (and students) living 
with dementia or caring for a person with dementia to be taken into account. Whilst the initial 
focus relates to dementia, this initiative will benefit those staff (and students) living with a wide 
variety of conditions or providing care for others. 

  We have introduced a number of staff support networks, including a Family network group which 
meets regularly. In addition to the informal networking and mutual support, the group considers 
issues impacting on those with caring responsibilities and the ways in which the organisation 
might support these.

3.  AthenaSWAN

  We are currently reviewing the AthenaSWAN framework with a view to making a submission 

during 2018. This accreditation focuses on gender equality and ensures that action plans are in 
progress to address areas of imbalance as far as possible.

4.  Gender KPI

  As one of its Key Performance Indicators, the University has committed to achieve a gender 
balance between 45%-60% within the Board, senior staff and management groups by 2021.

5.  Recruitment and Progression

  We continue to review and monitor our recruitment and promotion procedures to ensure there 

is nothing adversely affecting any particular group. That we have sound policies and practices in 
place to support our staff, in particular flexible working, staff development, succession planning 
and leadership development.
