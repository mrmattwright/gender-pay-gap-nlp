visits its Web Sites and any information collected about you will be 
used to firstly fulfil any service you might request and secondly 
improve how as a company we serve you. We do this by making appropriate 
use of the information. This information will not be disclosed to anyone outside of the 
Allen Ford group, its affiliated or associated companies, its agencies, 
dealers or licensees, and other companies with which Allen Ford has 
arranged services for your benefit. It will be treated in accordance 
with the relevant legal provisions concerning data protection and may be
 initially stored and processed inside or outside the European Union 
anywhere in the world. You have the right as an individual to find out what information we 
hold about you and make corrections if necessary; you also have the 
right to ask us to not use the information. We will make all practical 
efforts to respect your wishes. However certain legislation, especially 
related to safety issues or financial regulation (e.g. when dealing with
 Ford Credit) might prevent this. If you have any specific questions that are not covered in the FAQ 
section please mail your enquiry to Allen Ford, Tachbrook Park Drive, 
Warwick, CV34 6SY. Please note: all calls placed to telephone numbers shown on this site may be recorded for quality and training purposes. This document was last updated on June 25, 2015 Accreditation Statement We are a proud member of The Motor Ombudsman
accreditation scheme and are accredited to the CTSI-approved Service and Repair
/ New and Used Car Code of Practice, ensuring we operate to the highest
standards of service and offering peace of mind for customers. What are cookies? There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide you 
with tailored information from a Web Site. A cookie is an element of 
data, a file which is nothing but a line of text that a Web Site can 
send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Allen
 Ford pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return 
to our Site. For example a cookie might help you to avoid having to 
re-enter data you have given us before. You can set your browser to 
notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide 
whether or not to accept it. Which cookies does the Allen Ford website use and are they allowed by the new EU cookie laws? Not many, and we believe so, are the short answers. We use cookies to
 help you store used vehicles in the "My Showroom" page, and we use 
Google Analytics to help us understand how people use our site. (Neither
 of these collect ANY information that could be used to  personally 
identify you or your computer.) And that's it. The "My Showroom" 
cookie contains only vehicle reference numbers and details of pictures 
for that vehicle. It is NOT a "tracking" cookie. Full details about the purpose and actions of the Google Analytics cookies can be found here. What are the benefits to me of Allen Ford collecting my information? Collecting this information will help Allen Ford to achieve the following; 1. To make the Site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once. 2. Help us to provide information faster. 3. To help us create content more relevant to you. 4. To help you quickly find services or information available from Ford. 5. Using information to make improvements to the Site. 6. Assessing general trends within the Web Site and its use. 7. To alert you to new products, special offers, updated information and
 other new services that Ford considers to be of interest to you. Where 
you have given us your permission we might authorise other companies to 
contact you directly. What information might be collected by Allen Ford Web Sites? At Allen Ford, we intend to give you as much control as possible over 
your personal information. In general, you can visit Allen Ford on the 
Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about 
yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from 
you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know 
before we collect information from you on the Internet. Even before registration we will collect anonymous information 
about how you have used the Web Site. This is a common standard 
procedure for any Web Site on the Internet. The information collected 
does not personally identify you but may be helpful to us for marketing 
purposes or improving the services we offer. How will Allen Ford collect and store this information? The Site can collect information about you in a number of ways; either 
directly requesting it from you (as on a registration form) or by 
automatically recording information about your visit to this Site. For example we might collect data regarding your journey through the Site or record the options that you have chosen to take. Information is stored in a secure environment protected by a 
combination of physical and technical measures. There is no general 
public access to this information. For how long will Allen Ford store this information? Allen Ford will store this information in a secure and protected 
environment for as long as we believe it will better help us to 
understand how we can serve you, and respect your wishes. In addition 
legislation might oblige us to store this information for a certain 
period of time. To understand how you can amend, or update information stored about you 
then please refer to the appropriate question in this section. Who does this policy apply to? This policy applies to web sites designed for the use of individual consumers; it does not apply to corporate visitors. Allen Ford's Commitment to Children's Privacy? Protecting the privacy of children is important. For that reason, we 
never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we 
actually know are under 17 years of age. What about Internet & Site Security? The Internet is not a secure system and you should always be cautious about the information you disclose whilst on-line. Personal Information collected by Allen Ford Sites is stored in secure 
operating environments that are not available to the public. In some 
cases, such as the transmission of credit card numbers, the Personal 
Information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction, using 
appropriate secure technology. We will sometimes collect anonymous information about how you have used 
the Web Site. This is information that does not personally identify you 
but which may be helpful for marketing or improving the services we 
offer. Under what conditions might this Privacy Policy not operate? In addition to directly providing information to an Allen Ford Web Site,
 you might also provide Personal Information through e-mail exchanges 
made available to you on Allen Ford Web Sites. The Privacy Policy does 
not cover this type of transfer of your Personal Information. You should
 always be careful when distributing your Personal Information in this 
manner. How do I contact you? If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, you can contact us at : Allen Ford, Tachbrook Park Drive, Warwick, CV34 6SY ___________________________________________________________ Gender Pay Gap                         Back    Book A Service    Vehicle Valuation      Compare Saved Vehicles      Top          Close            Welcome to Allen Ford.
