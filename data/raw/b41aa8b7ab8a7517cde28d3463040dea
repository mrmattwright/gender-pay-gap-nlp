Shaping a better world through our actions and influence  - Cox Automotive, Corporate Responsibility Council    Corporate social responsibility in the UK  At our core we're a family business.

We're proud to say that this is a tradition we continue to this day.    Ethical purchasing policy – suppliers  Cox Automotive purchases a wide range of goods and services required in the operation of our business and we rely on a number of key suppliers for the delivery of our core services. Good working relationships with our suppliers are therefore central to the success of our business. Our purchasing policy ensures that our business standards are integrated throughout the supply chain. •    We are committed to obtaining and retaining competitive goods and services, whilst also ensuring they are from sources which have not jeopardised human rights, safety or the environment •    We are a member of the MSDUK network, We Connect, and are committed to  actively seeking diversity in our supply chain •    We aim to develop strong relationships with our suppliers, based on mutual trust, understanding and respect plus shared ethical values  Statement on preventing human labour exploitation (modern slavery)  Cox Automotive are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or any part of our business. Modern slavery is a crime which results in the abhorrent abuse of the human rights of vulnerable workers.

We will implement effective systems and controls to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place either within our own business or in any part of our supply chain, in compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The company expects the same high standards from all of its suppliers, contractors and other business partners, and as part of its contracting processes includes specific prohibitions against the use of modern slavery: in turn we expect our suppliers to hold their own supply chains to these high standards.

Cox Automotive Foundation     At Cox Automotive, we're all big supporters of local and national charities. Each year, the business chooses a Charity of the Year for its primary fundraising activities.  Our teams enthusiastically unite across the entire business to find fun and innovative ways to raise thousands of pounds in support.  Teams from every one of our auction centres are encouraged to choose local charities and community organisations to support. Their efforts never cease to be amazing.  In 2014, World Cup fund-raising fever helped inspire our teams to run through mud, climb obstacles, raffle cars, brave ice-cold sponges, bake a mountain of tasty buns and cakes, and even undertake a 92 hour relay marathon – all to help raise an eye-popping £45,000 for over 30 different charities.  Another great example of this includes the amazing national and local initiatives we ran during 2012, in support of the NSPCC. Inspired by the 2012 London Olympics Torch Relay, our national Golden Gavel fund-raising drive saw teams of Manheim colleagues run, jump, cycle and bake their way to raising thousands of pounds.
