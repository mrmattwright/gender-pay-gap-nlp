GENDER PAY GAP
REPORT APRIL 2017

SUCCESSION GROUP : 
ONE TEAM, ONE SUCCESSION

At  Succession  we  are  committed  to  equality,  diversity  and 
inclusion. During 2017 Succession made a major investment 
in  its  Human  Resources  function  and  implemented  a 
programme to develop our Vision and Values:

To BE THE BEST independent wealth management business 
in the UK

We want:

-   To attract and retain talented and diverse individuals who 
will  represent  our  core  values  and  strive  to  achieve  our 
business vision.

-   Our clients to be happy with what we do for them.

-   Both our clients and our people to share with others how 

good we are.

-   As a result become: One Team, One Succession.

The  clarity  of  our  vision  and  its  purposeful  execution  will 
ultimately  bring  us  success,  and  therefore  this  programme 
led to the launch of some significant initiatives:

OUR CLIENT VALUES

We  refreshed  and  defined  our  Group  Values  which  run 
throughout  our  organisation  -  it  is  a  constant.  One  major 
change 
is  that  our  Appraisal  Process  now  measures 
colleagues performance against the CLIENT values.

2

We  hope  that  by  building  an  organisational  foundation 
which is based on these Values our colleagues are focused 
on both their own development but also meeting the needs 
of current and future clients.

CLIENT FOCUSED

Our actions will always be for the benefit and in 

support of our clients.

LONG TERM & SUSTAINABLE

We will create sustainable teams and services that 
secure long term financial security for our clients.

INTEGRITY

RECRUITMENT AND TALENT MANAGEMENT

Our Recruitment and Talent Management processes ensure 
equality of opportunity and reflect CLIENT. Doing so, makes 
certain those colleagues that we recruit and promote are best 
placed to deliver our strategy. Our new Talent Management 
process  also  helps  the  Executive Team  and  Senior  Leaders 
across  the  business  to  identify  diverse  talent  with  potential 
and to put in place a development and career plan.

SUCCESSION ENGAGEMENT SURVEY

In September 2017 we had our very first Engagement Survey. 
This  provided  insight  into  how  we  can  improve.  89%  of 
colleagues completed the survey and the key messages are:

Our work and decisions will always be conducted 

with upmost integrity.

-   78% of Colleagues are engaged

EFFICIENT

-   88% of Colleagues have trust in our leadership

-   73%  of  Colleagues  would  recommend  us  as  a  great 

We will continuously evolve what we do and how we

place to work

NIMBLE

Our thinking, process and leadership will be nimble

This survey will be run regularly and the results will continue to 
inform how we can improve.

-   Succession Group’s Gender Pay Gap has improved during 

2017 and is below the financial services mean of 34%.

-   Our Gender Pay Gap is as a result of less women being 

employed at the most senior level.

-   There are more women than men that work for Succession 

but in roles that attract a lower salary.

-   The Gender Pay Gap is not driven by unequal pay. Our 
Recruitment process ensures we offer equal pay for equal 
work regardless of gender or background.

SUCCESSION GROUP : 
THE FUTURE

What are we doing to reduce our Gender Pay Gap?

in  both  our  pay  and  bonus  pay 
Succession’s  gap 
demonstrates  that  there  is  work  to  be  done.  Whilst  there  is 
not an equal pay issue, Succession will take steps to reduce 
its pay gap.

We  are  already  seeing  progress  in  this  area  with  our  mean 
Pay Gap reducing to 33.9% as at December 2017, which is 
an  8.1%  improvement.  This  is  below  the  Financial  Services 
National mean of 34%*.

OUR COMMITMENT IS AS FOLLOWS:

-   From  2018  Executive  member,  Simon  Charles  Group  HR 
Director, will be responsible and accountable for gender 
diversity and inclusion.

-   At  April  2017,  30%  of  our  Senior  Leadership  Team  were 

female and we will continue to focus on improving that.

-   Our Talent Management process will identify and nurture 

a pipeline of women.

-   In 2018 we have launched Flexible working options at all 

levels.

-   We  will  continue  to  gain  insight  on  our  gender  diversity 

through our annual Engagement Survey.
