Executive Summary  

Introduction and purpose 

This report contains Knowsley Council’s Gender Pay information for 2017.  In April 2017 section 78 of the Equality Act 2010 was enacted. This 
requires any organisation that has 250 or more employees to publish and report specific information on the make-up and pay of their 
workforce.  The Gender Pay Gap Report is a valuable resource to help monitor the workforce and provide year on year benchmarking 
information to assist workforce planning.  The Gender Pay Gap Report also supports the Council’s Equality and Diversity Policy Statement and 
provides intelligence and evidence for the Council’s Workforce Development Strategy, which is currently being drafted.    

Background 

As a public sector organisation, Knowsley Council has been publishing Workforce Monitoring reports since 2010.  These reports cover: - 

  The number of part-time and full-time staff;  
  Recruitment, promotion and performance review information; 
  Access to training;  
  Redundancy and leavers information;   
  Grievances and dismissals, including reported incidents of harassment;  
  The rates of return to work of women following maternity leave;  
  Public office holders such as members of boards or committees; 
  Gender pay gap information, for part-time and full-time employees;  
  Black and minority ethnic (BME) pay gap;  
  Disability pay gap;  
  Success rates of job applicants; breakdown of applicants; shortlisted and successful; applications for promotion and success rates;  
  Leavers details; 
  Length of service; and 
  An indication of any issues for trans-sexual staff, based on our engagement with trans-sexual staff or voluntary groups. 

Data limitations  

The data contained in this report is a snapshot of the relevant pay period; that is the pay period that includes 30 March 2017.  As detailed in 
the guidance the data used to make the calculations includes both headcount and salary, not all staff included in the head-count data will have 
counted as full pay relevant employees, for the pay gap data.   

Pay Calculations 

These calculations include two types of averages: - 
 

  A mean average involves adding up all of the numbers and dividing the result by how many numbers were in the list;  
  A median average involves listing all of the numbers in numerical order. If there is an odd number of results, the median average is the 

middle number. If there is an even number of results, the median will be the mean of the two central numbers.  

 

What is the Gender Pay Gap?  

The Equality and Human Rights Commission defines the difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap as follows: - 

1.  Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive equal pay, as set out in the 

Equality Act 2010; 

2.  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across an organisation or the labour 

market. It is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.  Men working full-time continue to have higher median hourly and weekly 
earnings than women. The median full-time gender pay gap is the difference in percentage terms between the median earnings of 
women and men working full-time. 

According to the Office for National Statistics in April 2017, the national median gender pay gap was 18.4%.  In respect of Knowsley, the pay 
gap based on median hourly earnings for full-time employees decreased to 9.1%, from 9.4% in 2016. This is the lowest since the survey began 
in 1997. In respect of Knowsley, the median part-time gender pay gap is 5.1%. The national mean pay gap is 23% and for full time workers it is 
14%.

Gender Workforce Profile 

As of 30 March 2017 Knowsley Council’s workforce headcount was 2,934 staff.  The majority of the Council’s workforce at this date was female 
(72%); and the majority of these female employees work part-time 42%, with 15% on a casual contract.  92% of the part-time workforce at this 
date was female, meaning that any policy that affects more part-time staff than full-time staff will have a disproportionate impact on women.

Total Workforce Demographic 

Local Government is unique in that the services Knowsley Council provides cross a number of sectors, including transport, leisure, education, 
health and social care, business development, community development, communication and finance.  These cover some but not all of the 
wide range of services that the Council provides.  This is important to note as each of these different sectors attracts a different workforce.  
Many of the jobs that women are employed in across the country are low paid and part-time, this is known as occupational segregation.  The 
ratio of women to men across the organisation is 21:8.  The ratio of part-time women to part-time men is 12:1; the ratio of full-time women to 
full-time men is 18:13.   The graph below shows the number of Council staff by gender and contract status: -

Median Gender Pay Gap  

The median gender pay gap is the difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female 
full-pay relevant employees.  The average median hourly rate across the council is £12.75; for women the rate is £11.95 and for men it is 
£13.52, meaning there is a median pay gap of 11.62%. 

This is an increase on the pay gap reported in the Council’s 2016 report and is due to the way the 2017 guidelines re-defined the criteria for 
the data set to be used to calculate the figures.  It is significantly lower (i.e. better) than the national median, gender pay gap of 18.4%1.
