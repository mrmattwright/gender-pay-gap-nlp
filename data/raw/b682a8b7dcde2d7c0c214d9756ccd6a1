The gender pay gap is different to equal pay which is the legal requirement that men and women are paid equally for doing the same job under the Equality Act 2010.  Gender pay reporting involves carrying out calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation. It will not involve publishing individual employee's data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website every year by the 30 March for the previous year's data.  How we calculate gender pay gap  There are six basic calculations. The calculations are:   our mean gender pay gap  our median gender pay gap  our mean bonus gender pay gap  our median bonus gender pay gap  our proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  our proportion of males and females in each quartile band   Note: We do not pay bonuses so calculations 3, 4 and 5 are not relevant.  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace  the balance of male and female employees at different levels  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded   Mean and median gender pay gap  The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the mean or median hourly rate of pay that male and female colleagues receive. The mean pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings of men and women. The median pay gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly earnings of men and women. It takes all salaries in the sample, lines them up in order from lowest to highest, and picks the middle-most salary.  Our results show that for males, mean average earnings are 2.1% lower than for females. Male median average earnings are 14.3% less than for females.    Proportion of male and female colleagues in each pay quartile  This chart shows the gender split when we order hourly rate of pay from highest to lowest and group into four equal pay quartiles.   Why we have a gender pay gap  The main reason for our organisation-wide gender pay gap is an imbalance of male and female colleagues across the organisation. The mean and median pay gap figures show that overall male employees have lower pay than female. However when the gender distribution is looked at by pay quartiles a more detailed picture is revealed which shows that at the moment there are fewer women in senior roles than men, and a higher proportion of men relative to women in the lower scales.  How we are addressing the gender pay gap  The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap. We have the current Human Resources and company policies in place to address gender inequality:   recruitment policy: promotion of equal opportunities and diversity, employees recruited and promoted on the basis of ability and other objective criteria, external job advertising where possible, gender balance reflected in interview panel members (i.e. comprised of males and females).  maternity support leave and paternity leave available for fathers/partners.  parental leave  shared parental leave  special leave  flexible working  training in recruitment and other Human Resources practices to encourage equality and diversity for managers  fair, equal and transparent pay and reward system: all jobs are subject to job evaluation using a job evaluation scheme that has been tested for ensuring equality  training programme for aspiring managers open to all: candidates assessed on ability  equality and diversity policy that is part of employees induction  more training courses planned on equality and diversity topics which will be open to all   Gender pay reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing Human Resources and payroll records.  All employees can confirm and update their records if they choose to by updating their details on the internal system or by contacting Human Resources  Learn more about gender pay reporting         Contact details:   Contact: Human Resources  Email:  human.resources@southlakeland.gov.uk  Telephone: 01539 733 333  Address: South Lakeland House, Lowther Street, Kendal, Cumbria LA9 4DQ              South Lakeland District Council Offices South Lakeland House Lowther Street Kendal Cumbria LA9 4DQ   01539 733 333  customer.services@southlakeland.gov.uk    Open hours Monday to Friday, 8.45am to 5pm             Please rate this page              Copyright © 2005 - 2017  Data Protection overview  About this site  Use of cookies on this site  Site map
