A diverse business  
is a better business

The best ideas come from  
a rich variety of perspectives 
and backgrounds – it’s how  
we innovate and it’s integral  
to our culture and values.

See more about our 
values on page 03

Women are an important part of RB’s business.
They represent almost 75% of our consumers,
both online and in store. It is just one of the many 
reasons why we overwhelmingly support equality  
and diversity across the organisation.

RB believes our gender and inclusion policies deliver 
tangible results. They lead to a better workplace,  
better decision making and better execution because 
of the diversity of our people, their cultures and,  
more importantly, their unique perspectives.

“A diverse 
workplace goes 
to the heart of 
our passion to 
innovate and 
outperform.”

We recognise we 
need to do more 
to retain women 
in senior roles

When it comes to gender and gender pay, we believe  
in equality. We practise equal pay for equal work. This 
report focuses on our UK gender pay gap, setting out  
the difference in average hourly pay between men and 
women across the organisation, as at the snapshot date  
of 5th April 2017. It shows that RB has a median gender pay 
gap of 0.1%, lower than the UK national average of 18.4%. 

However, we recognise there is a gap in the overall number 
of women in senior management, which leads to the 
gender pay gap, measured on a mean average basis, and 
also to RB’s gender bonus gap. Simply stated, while men 
and women have the same bonus earning opportunity,  
we have more males than females in senior management 
roles. Clearly, we must focus on increasing the proportion 
of women in these positions. In this report we outline our 
actions to address such imbalances.

We want women and men to have equal opportunities in 
the workplace because we believe it is in society’s interest. 
We want to be a business that puts women at the heart  
of its leadership and decision making. In this way, we  
serve not only our employees, but our consumers and 
shareholders, while also living up to our aspiration to  
be a truly inclusive organisation.

Equal pay  
for equal work

 

What is equal pay? 
Equal pay is a legal requirement, set out in the  
Equality Act 2010, to ensure that men and women 
performing like work or work of equal value are treated 
the same. It is the law and all employers must observe it. 
Equal pay applies not just to salary, but to all contractual 
terms and conditions of employment. For example, 
holiday entitlements, contractual bonuses, pay and 
reward schemes, pension payments and other 
contractual benefits. Equal pay law does not require that 
everyone doing the same job or an equal value job must 
earn exactly the same. There are a number of legitimate, 
non-discriminatory reasons why individuals performing 
the same duties may be paid differently – for example, 
factors such as experience, performance and relative 
competency may all be relevant.

All UK companies with legal entities employing 250 or more 
people are required to report the gender pay and bonus gaps 
across their business. This reporting covers six measures:
1.  Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay
2. Median gender pay gap in hourly pay
3. Mean bonus gender pay gap
4. Median bonus gender pay gap
5. Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment
6. Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile

Our 

approach to  
pay is gender 

neutral 
by design

How is the gender
pay gap calculated?

The MEDIAN  
gender pay gap
The median represents  
the mid-point or middle  
of a group/population.

The median  
gender pay gap  
is the difference 
between the hourly pay 
for the middle male 
compared with the 
middle female in  
a company.

Commentators consider 
the median to most 
closely represent the 
experience of the typical 
man and the typical 
woman when it comes  
to workplace pay.

The MEAN  
gender pay gap 
The mean represents the  
‘average’ in a group/population.

The mean gender pay gap  
is the difference between the average  
hourly pay for men and average hourly  
pay for women in a company.

RB overview
RB has several UK entities. To help our 
stakeholders understand RB’s overall UK  
gender pay gap, we have aggregated all  
this data here. This provides a complete  
gender pay picture across our UK businesses.

Our RB 2017 gender pay data has 
been independently assured by Deloitte. 
The individual UK entities’ data are 
shown on page 7.

UK Gender  
Pay picture continued

Favourable comparison 
According to the Office for National Statistics,  
in 2017 the UK’s median gender pay gap for full  
and part-time staff combined was 18.4% in favour  
of men. Our overall UK median gender pay gap  
for the same period was lower than this at 0.1%.  
Our mean gender pay picture for 2017 was 12.8%, 
which compares with the ONS national average  
for the UK of 17.4%. 

Outperformance
As part of our approach to recognising and 
rewarding outperformance, senior RB leaders  
have access to both short and long-term incentive 
plans. This means we face a challenge with our 
gender bonus gap as we have more male than 
female senior managers. 

Based on the average annual gross bonus paid,  
the RB 2017 bonus gap is 81.7% (mean) and 29.7% 
(median). While men and women have the same 
bonus earning opportunity at RB, we recognise the 
uncomfortable reality of this imbalance.  

RB is committed to closing this gender balance gap 
and has already implemented several initiatives  
in this area.

To understand the gap, it is important to note that  
the bonus gap is made up of annual bonus (short 
term) and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIPs). 

Annual bonus
Our annual bonus scheme operates in the  
same way for all participants. It incentivises top  
line revenue growth and a bottom line measure of 
profit growth. This is important as it is gender 
neutral and objective. All those in the same roles 
are offered the same opportunities to receive 
bonuses, irrespective of gender. 

RB supports part-time working, so that our 
employees can balance their personal and
professional lives. Pay and bonuses are adjusted 
accordingly. However, this is not recognised in the 
calculation of the gender bonus gap and more 
than 90% of RB’s part-time employees are women. 

Long-term incentives
LTIPs reward long-term performance and  
share price growth. At RB we have a strong pay  
for performance culture and alignment to 
shareholder value. An increase in share price leads  
to a corresponding value in terms of LTIP payout. 
LTIP allocation is gender neutral, which means that 
people at the same level in the organisation  
receive the same allocation of shares. 

And yet there are more men than women in those 
roles that offer higher incentive opportunities, 
including eligibility for LTIPs.

Finally, it is worth noting that the LTIP rewards 
long-term performance, with three and a half years 
between an award being made and it potentially 
paying out. As we are required to include the 
payouts during the 12 months to April 2017, which in 
RB were paid in May 2016, this year’s gender pay 
analysis reflects LTIPs awarded in 2012, when the 
number of women in senior roles was 24%. The 
proportion of females in such positions now stands 
at 28%.

What are quartiles?
Quartiles refer to the division of data into four 
equal-sized groups. When calculating gender pay data, 
the quartiles are calculated by listing all employees’ 
earnings in order (from highest to lowest), and splitting 
them into four even groups. This then allows you to 
calculate the proportion of men and women in each 
quartile.

Towards greater  
gender balance

A growing number of  
female leaders in the UK
Our leadership pipeline is solid and our focus 
is on increasing our retention rate for women  
at middle and senior management levels. 

Improving our gender balance  
is a strategic imperative.  
It starts with our hiring  
policies through to our  
leadership development  
and succession planning.

Our business in the UK is improving  
in terms of gender balance, but it is 
still some way from our goal of doubling 
the numbers of women in senior 
management. 

At RB we take gender and diversity  
very seriously. We are working hard  
on improving both metrics. A diverse 
workforce goes to the heart of our  
passion to outperform.

DARE to be different
In 2015, we introduced our DARE initiative  
to Develop, Attract, Retain and Engage  
talented women.
DARE positively supports work-life balance,  
dual careers and international mobility. We  
provide a generous maternity policy and female 
colleagues benefit from access to mentoring and 
tailored leadership development programmes.
Male colleagues champion gender equality  
at RB. Leading by example, last year our  
CEO Rakesh Kapoor was ranked in the Top 10 
Champions of Women in Business by the  
Financial Times and HERoes.

Towards greater  
gender balance continued

We aim to achieve greater balance through these 
3 actions:

1

Driving better balance  
in senior management 

•   Recruitment and selection practices to ensure all open positions 
have a gender-balanced shortlist and we attract a broad range of 
applicants. This means we always focus on selecting the best 
person for the job.

•   Provide mentoring and tailored development programmes for 

senior female leaders to improve retention rates.

2

Improving  
Work-Life Balance

•   We encourage flexible working arrangements to suit the changing 

needs of our employees.

•   Further embedding RB’s LiveyouRBest wellbeing programme.

Comprehensive global  

maternity policy:

16 weeks

paid leave and up  
to 12 months off

 
 

3

Nurturing Careers and  
Ensuring Career Progression

training and mentoring across the wider organisation, to help create  

•  Focus on career progression for women via specific leadership  
 
  a more equal distribution of gender at all levels. 
•   Undertake independent quantitative and qualitative research among 
female staff and our DARE* network to assess and better understand 
their views about working at RB, professional development and career 
progression opportunities.
* DARE is RB’s initiative to Develop, Attract, Retain and Engage talented women.

Conclusion 
There is much we can be proud of in this, our first 
report on gender pay:

• 

• 

 Equal pay for equal work and all bonuses based 
on company performance.
 Gender balance at graduate level and improved 
representation at senior management level in  
the UK.

•  Comprehensive global maternity/paternity policy.
• 

 DARE programme focusing on improving our 
retention rate of female senior leaders.

And yet, as this report points out, there are still 
areas where we acknowledge we need to do more.
 
In line with our aspiration to be a truly inclusive 
organisation, we want more women at the heart of 
our leadership and decision making.
 
In true RB spirit, we will apply our uncompromising 
determination to minimise any disparities or gender 
and pay gaps which exist.
