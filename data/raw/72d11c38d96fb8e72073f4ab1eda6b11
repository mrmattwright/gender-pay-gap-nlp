The figures attached have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  Under the law, men and women must receive equal pay for:   the same or broadly similar work;  work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or  work of equal value.   The Company is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability.  It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above).  As such the Company evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure.  The Company is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.  While the Company’s gender pay gap is generally comparable with that of organisations within the holiday home manufacturing sector, this is not a subject about which the Company is complacent, and it is committed to doing everything that it can to reduce the gap. However, the Company also recognises that its scope to act is limited in some areas – it has, for example, no direct control over:   the proportions of men and women applying for jobs;  the proportions of men and women applying for and obtaining promotions;   To date, the steps the Company has taken to promote gender diversity in all areas of its workforce include utilising the Pathway to Employment Initiative to employ female workers within the workforce and on equal pay to equivalent male counterparts.
