Marine Harvest (Scotland) Ltd: 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

As part of the Equality Act 2010, all UK companies employing 250 people or more are required to report on their gender pay gap
statistics. The gender pay gap is the difference in the average pay and bonuses of all men and women across an organisation.
This is different from Equal Pay, which focuses on whether men and women are paid the same for carrying out the same or
similar jobs. Across the UK, the gap shows that the average hourly earnings are 18.4% (median) and 17.4% (mean) (ONS 2017)
lower for women than men.

The statistics are inevitably influenced by a number of external and internal factors, not accounting for (among other things)
length-of-service, position, role or location; and should therefore be treated with a degree of caution. We are confident that we
have equal pay for work of equal value, rewarding our colleagues for their role not their gender; and that our approach to
recruitment, engagement, development and reward helps us to move towards closing the gap in the future.

Marine Harvest (Scotland) Ltd has a mean gender pay gap of 18.3% and a mean gender bonus gap of 21.2%. This gap is not
indicative of our pay policies and practices, but has arisen from finding fewer women than men in the senior leadership positions
that attract higher levels of pay and bonus. In part, this is a reflection of the progression of employees with most experience in our
farming sector, which historically has been male-dominated.

Our policy and aim is to base employment, recognition, reward and career development opportunities on the basis of job
qualifications (eg education, prior experience) and merit, in order to maintain consistency and fairness regardless of gender. We
are continuing to review and develop our people strategies to deliver this aim.

I can confirm that the data contained in this report is accurate
