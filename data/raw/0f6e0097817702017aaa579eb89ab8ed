Fawcett Report  In October 2011 Bristol Fawcett produced an impact assessment of public spending cuts on women in Bristol.  They concluded that many of the spending cuts underway in Bristol would have a disproportionate impact on women.  The report identifies that many cuts will lead to greater inequality between women and men and for some women may have a negative impact on their human rights.  A copy of the report can be found on the Bristol Fawcett website .
