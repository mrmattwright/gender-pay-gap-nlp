The gender pay gap describes the difference between the average earnings of all the women in an organisation compared to the average earnings of all the men in that organisation. This is not the same as equal pay, which is about ensuring men and women doing the same or comparable jobs are paid the same.  We are required to publish the following:   Gender pay gap (mean and median averages)  Gender bonus gap (mean and median averages)  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure   CPFT produces an annual Equality Report highlighting a number of workforce trends including gender balance, which is approved at Board level and published on the Trust website. In our organisation, Clinical Excellence Awards apply to consultant level medical and dental staff, these are defined as a bonus within the Gender Pay definitions. As a healthcare provider, a high proportion of CPFT’s workforce is female, working within the community in a range of health related roles. CPFT will ensure an inclusive approach is maintained including recruitment and career development for all staff.  The Trust’s gender pay information is also published on the Government website, you can view our overview here.
