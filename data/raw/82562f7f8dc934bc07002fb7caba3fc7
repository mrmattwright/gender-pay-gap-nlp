                                            Gender Pay Statement   Gender Pay Statement 2018  We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and the government gender pay website. We will do this within one calendar year from April 5 th 2017.  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace.  the balance of male and female employees at different levels.  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.  The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.   Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing HR and weekly PAYE payroll records.      1    Average gender pay gap as a mean average        8.9%      2    Average gender pay gap as a median average        0.0%      3    Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average        53.3%      4    Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average        24.4%      5    Proportion of staff eligible for bonus, actually received it    Male  6.0%    Female  8.0%            6    Proportion of men and women in the four banded pay groups    Male    Female          Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile      33.8%      66.2%          Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at or below the median      25.0%      75.0%          Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile      30.8%      69.2%          Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile      39.1%      60.9%        The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  Gretna Green Ltd is an equal opportunities employer and has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, irrespective of gender. We currently employ more women (68%) than men (32%).  All trainees and new staff are recruited under the same structure and their earning ability depends on their success and career progress. All employees are encouraged to grow and earn to their full potential. Any pay gap difference shown will be a result of differing roles and bandings, however, all employees working in the same bandings will be earning the same rewards. Measures will take time to show, however through training, mentoring and support we will aim to reduce any pay gap figures so that it represents a more balanced and equal situation.  Gretna Green Ltd is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.  We strive to continually improve our gender gap and will publish the results again in April 2019 as a requirement of the government initiative into equal pay.  I confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
