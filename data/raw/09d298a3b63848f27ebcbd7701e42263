TOWERGATE’S GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017
Towergate is one of the UK’s largest independent insurance intermediaries and is committed 

to transparency, equality and the fair treatment of all our employees.

UNDERSTANDING THE GENDER PAY GAP

From April 2017, all organisations with over 250 employees are required to report their gender pay gap annually. Gender pay 
compares the average (mean1  and median2) hourly earnings of male employees and the average earnings of female employees in 
a company, regardless of their job role.  The difference between those average earnings is known as the gender pay gap, which is 
expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.  

Gender pay is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay looks at whether men and women receive equal pay for equal work. A gender 
pay gap may exist where there is equal pay. For example, there will be a gender pay gap where more men than women are 
employed in higher earning roles. 

ANALYSING TOWERGATE’S GENDER PAY GAP

Towergate has over 4,000 employees across several employing companies. 

We are only legally obliged to report on the four of our Group companies that have more than 250 employees. However, we have 
gone further because we agree with the Government’s principle that greater transparency is key to accelerating the closure of the 
gender pay gap, as it promotes consideration of the complex reasons for it and drives action and change. Therefore, the main body 
of this report gives information on the gender pay gap for employees across our entire Group. Separate figures are produced in 
Appendix A in relation to the four companies we are legally obliged to report on individually.

INDUSTRY

Figure 2 shows the distribution of relevant male and female employees in four quartile pay bands by dividing the Group’s workforce 
into four equal segments. The higher proportion of men within the top pay quartile (73.7%) indicates that our gender pay gap exists 
because there are more men in senior roles which attract a higher rate of pay. 

In 2016, a higher percentage of women received a bonus than men. However, we recognise that there is a gap in the average bonus 
paid to women and men. Towergate has a number of bonus schemes which are tailored to different roles to compliantly incentivise 
and reward employees. Sales and management roles (a greater proportion of which are undertaken by men) typically attract higher 
annual bonuses due to the impact and responsibility of those roles.

In addition, 2015 was an unusual year for Towergate which completed a financial restructure and recapitalisation. This triggered 
exceptional one off payments (which have been included in these figures) to some senior sales and management employees which 
significantly contributes to the gender bonus gap for 2016. When we exclude the exceptional one off payment, our mean bonus 
pay gap drops to 57.2% while our median bonus gap drops to 24.8%.

TACKLING OUR GENDER PAY GAP

We are proud that 50% of our workforce is made up of women and a growing number of women carry out senior and board level 
roles within our business. Currently 33% of our Senior executive team are female leaders, as are 23% of our senior managers.

PWC 6, the professional services firm, reports that in the insurance industry women represent only 12% of executive committees. 
Towergate bucks that trend already and continues to challenge this position by carrying out some key actions outlined over the 
following pages. 

 

OUR ACTION PLAN

Following detailed analysis of our gender pay gap and research into national and international trends, we are being proactive  
in taking action to address our gender pay gap by seeking to minimise the impact of limiting factors and promoting positive factors 
including: 

• 
• 
• 

• 

Strengthen our flexible working policy – all vacancies and opportunities will be offered on flexible working terms
Improving enhanced maternity pay – we have increased enhanced maternity pay to 100% of basic salary for 3 months
Develop female senior leaders of the future – allocate 10% of the learning and development budget to leadership training and 
personal development for female talent.
Eliminate unconscious bias in our recruitment processes.
