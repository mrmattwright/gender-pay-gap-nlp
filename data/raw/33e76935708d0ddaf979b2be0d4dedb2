Context 
 
From April 2017, all organisations with over 250 employees at 31 March 2017 are 
required to report on their gender pay gap.  The gender pay gap is defined as the 
differences in the average hourly earnings of men and women over a standard time 
period, regardless of their role. 
 
The Blackpool Sixth Form College’s workforce consists of significantly more females 
than males. This reflects industry trends and also our student profile. Our gender pay 
gap results should be considered in the context of this distribution as the predominance 
of females to males has a significant influence on our overall gender pay gaps.

Mean 
Median 
 
The median rate is calculated as a halfway point for females and a halfway point for 
males. The percentage difference is therefore representative of the significant 
proportion of female employees we have in part time support roles such as in-house 
cleaners, which tend to be on the lower points of the Sixth Form Colleges (SFC) pay 
scales. For the purposes of this report, casual workers have not been included.

Bonus breakdown 
 
No bonuses were paid at the extraction date or in the 12 weeks preceding, therefore 
there are no bonus gaps. 
 
Summary 
 
The Blackpool Sixth Form College believes in creating a diverse and gender balanced 
workforce which reflects our students and our community.  Our pay scales are 
determined nationally by the Sixth Form Colleges Association and we work within the 
parameters of these scales.   
 
New teaching staff are employed at the rate relevant to their number of years teaching 
and new support staff are employed on a rate (within the SFC pay scales) applicable to 
their role and any relevant experience.   
 
We are keen to ensure that we promote applications to new roles to all members of our 
community in order that we are as inclusive as possible.
