Services include:   Adult mental health  Forensic and specialist mental health  Older people’s mental health  Children’s mental health  Children’s community  Older people and adult community  Specialist learning disability  Primary care and liaison psychiatry  Substance misuse  Social care  Research and development   We support a population of just under a million people and employ nearly 4,000 staff. Our biggest bases are at the Cavell Centre, Peterborough, and Fulbourn Hospital, Cambridge, but our staff are based in more than 50 locations.

We will maximise life opportunities for individuals and their families by enabling them to look beyond their limitations to achieve their goals and aspiration. In other words:  ‘To offer people the best help to do the best for themselves’  Our values - PRIDE   Professionalism - We will maintain the highest standards and develop ourselves and others... by demonstrating compassion and showing care, honesty and flexibility Respect -  We will create positive relationships... by being kind, open and collaborative Innovation - We are forward thinking, research focused and effective... by using evidence to shape the way we work Dignity - We will treat you as an individual... by taking the time to hear, listen and understand Empowerment - We will support you... by enabling you to make effective, informed decisions and to build your resilience and independence  Our vision  We want to give those people who need our services the best possible chance to live a full and happy life, despite their condition or circumstances.  Recovery  – we will adopt the principle in all our services of empowering patients to achieve independence and the best possible life changes removing dependence and giving them and their families (in the case of children) control over their care.  Integration – we will work closely with providers along pathways to deliver integrated person-centred care and support to local people close to their homes, principally in non-institutional settings. We will integrate with key partners to improve efficiency and effectiveness and simplify access.  Specialist services  – we are one of England’s leading providers of key specialist mental health services with particular expertise in eating disorders, children and young people’s mental health, autistic spectrum disorders and female personality disorders.  ​​All of the above will be supported by our IT and estates strategies.
