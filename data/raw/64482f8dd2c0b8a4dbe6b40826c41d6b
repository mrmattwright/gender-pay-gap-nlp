Gender Pay Gap – Summary  
 
Under  the  Equality  Act  2010  (Gender  Pay  Gap  Information)  Regulations  2017  and  the 
separate but parallel gender pay gap reporting provisions for public sector employers, which 
are  contained  in  the  Equality  Act  2010  (Specific  Duties  and  Public  Authorities)  Regulations 
2017 (the public sector Regulations), in force from 31 March 2017, relevant employers in the 
public sector are required to publish gender pay gap information by reporting the percentage 
differences in pay between their male and female employees.  
Employers must publish the information within 12 months of the "snapshot date" of 31 March 
meaning that the deadline for first publication is 30 March 2018. The prescribed information 
must be published on an annual basis thereafter.  

For the reporting obligations to apply, the employer must employ 250 or more employees on 
the snapshot date of 31 March in the year to which the required information relates. In relation 
to  the  threshold,  the  figure  of  250  is  not  a  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  figure,  but  a  total 
headcount. 

Employers must publish six metrics for 2016-17, and each subsequent year, in respect of the 
"relevant pay period" in which 30 March falls. The six metrics are set out in the Regulations 
as: 

the difference in the mean hourly rate of pay between male and female full-pay relevant 
employees (reg.2(1)(a)); 
the difference in the median hourly rate of pay between male and female full-pay relevant 
employees (reg.2(1)(b)); 
the proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in each of the four quartile 
pay bands (reg.2(1)(f)); 
the  difference  in  mean  bonus  pay  between  male  and  female  relevant  employees 
(reg.2(1)(c)); 
the  difference  in  median  bonus  pay  between  male  and  female  relevant  employees 
(reg.2(1)(d)); and 
the  proportions  of  male  and  female  relevant  employees  who  received  bonus  pay 
(reg.2(1)(e)).

Gender Pay and the Olympus Academy Trust 
 
At the snapshot date of 30 March 2017, the Olympus Academy Trust had 550 employees. 426 
(77.5%)  were  female  and  124  (22.5%)  were  male.  We  are  a  flexible  and  family-friendly 
employer, offering a significant number of roles on a part-time and/or term-time only basis. A 
substantial number of our employees who take up this flexibility are female.

No bonuses were paid to any member of staff for the reporting period.  
 
We  have  a  higher  proportion  of  females  in  every  quartile,  including  the  upper  quartile.  
Although we have a majority of females in the junior pay grades, we also have a majority of 
women in the upper leadership pay grades.  

 
Breakdown of Gender Pay Across The Olympus Academy Trust  
 
Teaching Staff:  
244 teaching members of staff. 181 (74.2%) are female and 63 (25.8%) are male.  
 

Support Staff:  
306 support members of staff. 245 (80%) are female and 61 (20%) are male. 
 
Across  The  Olympus  Academy  Trust  there  were  24  teaching  staff  paid  on  the  Leadership 
scale  (as  Assistant  Head  Teachers,  Deputy  Head  Teachers  and  Head  Teachers)  and  13 
(54.2%) of these were females. This shows that females make up the majority of the more 
senior levels in The Olympus Academy Trust. 

 
General Pay Principles 
 
The  Olympus  Academy  Trust  is  committed  to  ensuring  staff  are  remunerated  in  a  fair, 
transparent  and  consistent  manner,  ensuring  the  retention  of  quality  staff  and  equality  of 
opportunity for all1.  
 
The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. The gender pay gap measures the differences 
between the average pay of male and female employees, irrespective of job role

or seniority. Equal pay concerns look at pay differences between male and female employees 
performing the same or similar work, or work of equal value.  

The Olympus Academy Trust is, therefore, confident that its gender pay gap does not stem 
from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender 
pay  gap  is  the  result  of  the  roles  in  which  men  and  women  work  within  the  Trust  and  the 
salaries that these roles attract. 

Although not bound by the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions document (STPCD)2, the 
Trust ensures that terms and conditions of employment for all teaching staff will be no less 
than those provided for within the STPCD which is entirely irrespective of gender.  
 
The Trust ensures that terms and conditions of employment for all support staff will be no less 
than  those  provided  for  under  National  and  local  agreements  for  school-based  staff,  as 
outlined  in  the  Green  Book  and  local  conditions  of  service  for  schools  which  is  entirely 
irrespective of gender.  
 
Pay Determination 
 
The Board of Trustees is responsible for determining the policies relating to the salaries of all 
staff. All decisions on pay are made within the context of the Trust’s pay policy.  
 
The Trust is committed to being an employee of choice and the intention of this policy is to 
support this ethos by providing for all staff to be valued and to receive appropriate financial 
recognition  for  the  duties  undertaken.  There  will  be  equality  of  opportunity  for  all  staff  and 
decisions will be made on a non-discriminatory basis.  
 
To  ensure  fairness,  transparency  and  consistency  across  all  schools  within  the  Trust, 
assessment of performance, and the subsequent pay recommendations that are made, will 
be supported and rooted in evidence. Scrutiny by the Trust’s Remuneration and Nominations 
Committee  will  ensure  equality  of  application  across  the Trust.  Staff move  through the  pay 
scales for their grade  based  on  a thorough  and robust  performance management  process, 
meaning earnings are based on performance outcomes, irrespective of their gender.
