The requirement is to carry out six calculations which show the size of the gender pay gap between our male and female employees. Using the Gender Pay Gap legislation, the relevant figures have been calculated and are set out in the report below.  There is a gender pay gap within the company, as there is in most UK companies, however one of the main reasons for this is that we employ more men in service engineer/technician roles and more women in administrative roles.    399 Male Employees   54 Female Em ployees    (Employees eligible to be included in the Gender Pay Gap calculations)     GENDER PAY GAP RESULTS  Our MEAN gender pay gap is 27.6 % (Compared to a UK average of 9.4% in 2016)  Our MEDIAN gender pay gap is 28.3 %     Pay Quartiles  A summary of how men and women sit within quartile pay bands.  QUARTILE  PERCENTAGE OF MEN  PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN  Lower Quartile  69.03 %  30.97 %  Lower Middle Quartile  92.92 %  7.08 %  Upper Middle Quartile  96.46 %  3.54 %  Upper Quartile  93.86 %  6.14 %       Bonus Payments  The figures below show the number of men and women who were eligible for a bonus as a percentage of the total headcount.   67.1 %  Percentage of Men receiving a Bonus   87.7 %  Percentage of Women receiving a Bonus     The MEAN Bonus pay gap =    43.4 % (Men receiving a higher MEAN bonus than Women)  The MEDIAN Bonus pay gap = -33.9 % (Women receiving a higher MEDIAN bonus than Men)    Analysis  Konecranes Demag UK Ltd is committed to the principles of equal pay for all our employees. Female Service Technicians are paid the same as male Service Technicians and male administrators are paid the same as female Administrators.  In our business, it has historically been a male dominated workforce and this is still true to this day. The company encourages applicants from women for all job roles especially the Service Technician roles but the vast majority of applicants for these roles, continue to be from men.  The gender pay gap is at a figure of 27.6 % - virtually all our Technicians are men and most of our administrators are women - the difference in pay between these job roles goes some way to explain the gender pay gap percentage. Also, men make up a larger proportion of higher roles within the company.  67.1 % of men were eligible to receive a bonus whereas 87.7 % of women were eligible.  Again, this comes down to job roles and a higher percentage of roles filled by women were eligible for a bonus.  Although the MEAN Bonus pay gap was 43.4% in favour of men, the MEDIAN bonus pay gap was 33.9% in favour of women - this is due to a large number of small operative bonus payments made to men.
