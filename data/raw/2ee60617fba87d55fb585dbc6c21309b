What is a gender pay gap?
A gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in average pay of men and women, regardless of the number of male vs. 
female in the organisation or the nature of their work.
How is it calculated?
Median Pay - if all employees were lined up in 
a female line and a male line, in order of pay 
from highest to lowest, the Median gender 
pay gap compares the pay of the woman 
in the middle of their line and the pay of the 
middle man.
Mean Pay - the Mean gender pay gap shows 
the difference in the average hourly rate of 
pay between men and women.
How is this different to Equal Pay?
Equal pay is the is the difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs. The Gender Pay 
Gap does not give us a measure of Equal Pay. Having conducted some analysis of like for like roles we are confident that 
we practice Equal Pay within CDK Global.

The large difference between the Mean and Median can be 
attributed the higher proportion of men vs. women in our 
most senior level roles.

Pay Quartiles
As you can see there are fewer women in upper middle 
and upper quartiles and our action overleaf is intended to 
address this imbalance.

Taking Action

We are focused on reducing the gender imbalance within CDK Global by attracting, developing and engaging female talent 
in an industry that has historically been male dominated. There is lots to be done, but here is a snapshot of some of the 
action we have already taken:

Putting Diversity On 
The Agenda
At the start of last year we 
launched a new Diversity & 
Inclusion strategy focused 
initially on addressing gender 
representation within CDK Global. 
Each month we share an update 
on our progress with this work, 
and encourage Associates who 
are passionate about this topic to 
get involved in existing networking 
groups or form new ones. This 
has since led to the creation of a 
Women’s Network and Parenting 
Forum in the UK. On 8th March 
2018 we held our first Diversity 
& Inclusion Event to celebrate 
International Women’s Day with a 
full calendar of events planned for 
the year ahead.

Listening and 
Taking Action
Our Associates views are 
important to us, and last year’s 
engagement survey highlighted 
that our Maternity and Paternity 
policies could be improved to 
better support new parents. As a 
result, last summer we launched 
new policies, with increased leave 
and maternity  and paternity pay. 
In addition we created a number 
of guides designed to help our 
Associates and their Managers 
navigate what can be both an 
exciting and challenging time. 
We have just received the results 
of our 2018 survey and continue 
to be committed to taking action 
in response to the feedback we 
receive.

Developing Careers
In Technology
Over the last 12 months our 
STEM Programme has delivered 
two successful events working 
with local schools to encourage 
young people to consider a 
career in technology. Each of our 
Executive Leadership Team (ELT) 
have been paired with a female 
within our business as part of our 
new Mentoring Programme, and 
hold monthly sessions Both the 
mentors and mentees had fed 
back that they have benefitted 
from this relationship. Our ELT 
have also been asked to nominate 
a female to deputise for them at 
their monthly Board meetings to 
give more exposure to this level of 
the business.

Building Future
Leaders In Technology
In 2017 our first female Executive 
Leadership Team member was 
appointed which though a small 
feat is a positive step in the 
right direction. In addition, as 
of today we have seen an 11% 
increase in the representation of 
women in senior roles vs. 2016. 
Our recruitment team have been 
focused on ensuring that, where 
possible, all roles have a balance 
of male and female candidates. 
Ensuring our job ads use gender 
neutral language and we widen 
the search net to capture those 
outside of conventional career 
paths.

The Future

OUR FOCUS 
ON DIVERSITY & 
INCLUSION AND 
ADDRESSING GENDER 
REPRESENTATION 
WITHIN CDK GLOBAL 
IS ONGOING.

In addition to the initiatives shared, this year we will launch a series of 
‘Unconscious Bias’ training Programmes. These are designed to ensure our 
recruitment team, Hiring Managers, Executive Leadership Team and wider 
Associate population feel equipped to approach their interactions without 
bias or pre-judgement.
Our Mentoring Programme will be extended to reach a wider population of 
our business who would benefit from this type of relationship. Our existing 
mentee group have also been invited to take part in a Peer Coaching 
Programme to share learnings, and invited to become mentors themselves to 
create more visible female role models within CDK Global.
