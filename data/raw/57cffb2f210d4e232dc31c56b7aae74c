What we believe  Equality  We believe that everybody should be treated impartially and given a fair chance.  Diversity  We value individual differences. We aim to create an inclusive, nurturing environment where everybody can achieve their potential. This strengthens our community and encourages innovation through sharing different perspectives and ideas.  Inclusion  We know that positive social change takes actions, not words. That’s why we work to improve social inclusion and close the opportunity gap through work experience, apprenticeship and recruitment programmes. This supports wider society and our work community, and means that we recruit the best people for the job.  Respect  We are proud to have signed the FIR ‘Better for Everyone’ commitment  As well as treating people fairly and being supportive of people’s differences, we insist on respect for everyone. Our policy of continual development and internal promotion benefits everyone: people, teams, clients and communities.  We have a number of fairness, inclusion and respect (FIR) ambassadors. Our HSQE team delivers toolbox talks on respectful language and we encourage discussion on personal gender pronouns .  Decision-making and measurement  To ensure we meet our commitments to equality, diversity and inclusion, we measure, monitor and review our activities, and those of our suppliers and subcontractors.  Achievements   We won a Crossrail Sustainability award for ‘maximising employment opportunities’.  In an inspection by the National Skills Academy for Rail (NSAR) VGC scored “Outstanding” in the field of equality and diversity.  VGC is a signatory to the REC Youth Employment Charter.  Our apprenticeship programme offers NVQ level 2 and 3 placements in areas including general construction operations, human resources, procurement and general business administration.  Our work experience programme allows school pupils to gain an appreciation of the career opportunities in the industry.  We offer internships and summer work placements to college students.  We were awarded equality accredited employment status by the Equality Accreditation Service, following our achievements on the Olympic Park.
