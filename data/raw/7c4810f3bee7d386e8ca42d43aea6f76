Gender Pay Gap Report 2017
IKEA UK

A message from Gillian and Carin

 

 

2

Across the UK, around 10,900 people work in our 
stores, distribution centres and offices. It is their 
uniqueness and diversity that drives our success. 
Together, we uphold the IKEA values and work 
towards our vision to create a better everyday life  
for the many people.

We want to create a diverse and inclusive environment where 
every co-worker can express themselves and is treated 
equally, regardless of gender identity, age, ethnicity, beliefs, 
or any other aspect of their identity. As part of this, we believe 
that everyone should be fairly rewarded for the work that they 
undertake and we are proud to pay all UK co-workers the real 
Living Wage as a minimum.
In 2017, the UK Government introduced regulations that 
require businesses with over 250 employees to publish 
their gender pay gap and gender bonus gap. We welcome 
this legislation which will lead to greater transparency and 
encourage action to reduce the gender pay gap. This report 
covers our Retail business and our Distribution operations – 
responsible for the movement of IKEA products between our 
warehouses, stores and customers. It details key data and our 
approach to achieving gender equality across IKEA in the UK.
Today, the gap in our Retail business is smaller than the UK 
average and that of the retail sector, and in our Distribution 
operation the gap is reversed, with the mean and median for 
women higher than that of men. But there is still more to do – 
to understand why the gap exists and to close it.
We aim to achieve an equal split of men and women at every 
level. Creating this report has helped us to identify where 
to focus our efforts. In April 2017, when the data for this 
report was collected, we had more men than women at store 
management level and senior country management positions. 
Since then we have hired more women to our country 
management team, bringing the total to seven women and 

    IKEA UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

five men. This is just one example and we will now look to 
develop a holistic approach towards gender equality across  
the organisation.
We have a huge opportunity to extend our impact far  
beyond IKEA, using our scale and influence, and partnering 
with others: 
•   In the UK, we are part of the Retail Week Be Inspired 
initiative – working to develop future female leaders. 

•   IKEA is represented on the UN Secretary-General’s High-
Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment and has 
contributed to the UN’s Standards for Business to prevent 
discrimination against lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex 
people. 

•    On 26 February IKEA Group CEO, Jesper Brodin, signed the 
Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), a joint initiative 
of UN Women and the UN Global Compact, that provide a 
framework for business on how to empower women in the 
workplace, marketplace and community.

We are determined to lead by example – securing the success 
of IKEA and sharing our successes and challenges with others. 
This is how we will achieve a lasting impact that truly reaches 
the many people.

Introduction

Creating an inclusive culture
The IKEA vision is to create a better 
everyday life for the many people. This 
starts with our co-workers. We put our 
people at the heart of everything we 
do – caring for people, diversity and 
inclusion are embedded in the IKEA 
vision and values. 
We want to create an inclusive culture 
where all co-workers are treated 
fairly, have equal opportunities and 
can be themselves, regardless of their 
background or identity. We do not 
tolerate any kind of discrimination – 
whether it is based on age, gender 
identity, sexual orientation, physical 
ability, ethnicity, race, nationality, 
religion, marital or family status or any 
other dimension of a person’s identity. 
These values are supported by formal 
standards such as our Human Rights and 
Equality Policy. 
Promoting equality and inclusion is 
not only the right thing to do, it also 
benefits our business. Diverse and 
inclusive teams are more creative and 
innovative, benefitting from a wide range 
of viewpoints and experiences, and the 
unique contribution of each co-worker.

    IKEA UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

What is the gender pay gap?
Throughout this report we want to 
clarify that the gender pay gap and 
equal pay are two different things. 

Gender pay gap is the difference 
between the average (mean and 
median) hourly earnings of men 
and women across an organisation, 
expressed as a percentage of men’s 
earnings. 

This is different from an equal pay 
comparison: a direct comparison 
between people doing the same or 
similar work, or work of ‘equal value’. 
Equal pay for equal work is a legal 
requirement, as set out in the Equality 
Act of 2010.

Why is this an issue?
The gender pay gap is influenced by 
many structural and social factors. For 
example, the ways in which different 
types of work and roles have traditionally 
been viewed and valued, leading to 
disproportionate amounts of men in 
higher-paid jobs. Without a concerted 
effort to address these issues, historic 
disparities will persist. At IKEA we’re 
committed to addressing this and 
ensuring a gender-equal and inclusive 
workplace for all.

Our approach to gender 
equality
Our ambition is to achieve gender 
equality, taking a holistic approach.  
This means that as well as aiming for 
gender balance in all levels and positions, 
we want to create an inclusive culture 
where both women and men are valued 
for their unique contributions. 
At IKEA UK, we recognise that holding 
leadership positions and being involved 
with family life don’t have to be mutually 
exclusive. We believe that organisations 
have an important role to play in 
supporting and enabling women and 
men to do both. We are determined 
to play our part in contributing to the 
development of a fairer society.
Our Gender Equality Plan guides us to 
take practical steps towards a gender-
equal workplace, based on our broader 
Diversity and Inclusion Approach. It is 
integrated within our business plans 
and HR practices, shaping our approach 
to employee benefits, recruitment, 
succession planning, and learning and 
development.

Results for 2017 

The figures are calculated for all IKEA operations in  
the UK, which are divided between Retail and Distribution. 
Period data is comprised of ordinary pay, calculated from 
a monthly sample from April 2017, as required by the 
regulations. Ordinary pay includes paid leave, but does  
not include overtime pay, payments in lieu of leave or  
non-monetary benefits.

Pay quartiles 
Quartiles are calculated by 
listing the pay rates for each 
co-worker, from lowest to 
highest, splitting the list into 
four equal-sized groups and 
calculating the percentage of 
men and women in each.

Mean and median
In line with the UK Government’s gender pay gap reporting 
regulations, we provide data on both the mean and median 
gender pay gaps. Both are important. The mean is a good 
way of comparing across the entire organisation, taking into 

Median 

account total hourly pay and number of co-workers. The 
median is useful as it is less skewed by extreme values (for 
example, if one person is paid significantly more than others 
in the organisation).

Bonus headcount
We offer an annual bonus through the One IKEA Bonus scheme, 
available to all co-workers, regardless of their level or department. 
The bonus percentage varies from year to year, based on the 
performance of each unit and the co-worker’s annual salary. 
(See page 6 for details).

Our performance

At IKEA UK we have an equal pay approach and an almost 50/50 
gender split across the organisation. However, in April 2017 we had 
more men than women at store management level and in senior 
country management positions. In addition, a higher proportion  
of our female co-workers work part-time in our Retail organisation. 

This affects both the gender pay gap and bonus pay gap results.
The figures for Distribution show a reversed gap. Although men 
tend to be significantly overrepresented in the industry, most 
of the women that work in our Distribution organisation are in 
managerial roles, which are higher paid and more likely to be  
full time.

Working towards gender equality

6

We want to eliminate the gender 
pay gap and continue to nurture an 
environment where each co-worker 
receives the support they need to 
develop their career and reach their 
potential, and has the opportunity 
to thrive.
We are already making good 
progress towards a more equal 
workplace through a number of 
initiatives, both in the UK and 
globally.

One IKEA Bonus scheme
The One IKEA Bonus recognises the 
contribution that all co-workers make 
towards growth and success. Subject  
to meeting goals and targets, it is 
awarded each year to everyone who 
has been employed for six continuous 
months, regardless of their level or 
the function they work in. For how it is 
calculated, see page 5. 

50/50 gender split target
We have robust 50/50 gender split 
targets, against which we monitor 
our performance. At the end of FY17,2 
52.5% of all co-workers were female, 
including 49.8% of managers across 
Retail and Distribution. 

2   FY17 is the period between 1 September 2016 

and 31 August 2017

Real Living Wage
As well as being an accredited Living 
Wage employer, IKEA UK has been  
a Principal Partner of the Living Wage 
Foundation since April 2016. All our 
co-workers are paid a meaningful  
wage that truly supports the cost of 
living, regardless of their age or gender 
– currently £10.20 in London and  
£8.75 in the rest of the UK.
 

    IKEA UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

Enhanced maternity leave 
We pay 100% of the average weekly 
earning for the first six weeks for  
co-workers with over 26 weeks’ service, 
with an extra 12 weeks at 50% of pay 
for those who have been at IKEA for at 
least two years. And we want to make 
it easier for new mothers to return to 
work. That’s why we offer them their full 
salary while working half their hours for 
the first three months back at work.

Learning and development
The Performance and Development 
Process supports the individual 
performance and development of  
all co-workers. Each co-worker is 
supported by their manager to set 
goals, discuss their development  
and evaluate their performance.  
This unlocks opportunities for growth 
and new experiences, enabling  
co-workers to improve and contribute  
to our overall success. 
Every year we hold a talent week  
across all stores and units, supporting 
and motivating our co-workers to lead 
their own development by providing 
advice and information.

Inclusive policies and 
flexible working
Our policies and employment offer  
are continually reviewed to help all  

co-workers feel respected, 
acknowledged and included in the 
workplace, and to live a full and 
balanced life.

Inclusion and unconscious 
bias e-learning and training
As part of our Diversity and Inclusion 
approach, all co-workers undertake 
mandatory e-learning, as well as 
broader diversity and inclusion  
training to help identify and address 
unconscious bias, particularly in 
recruitment and development. 

Recruitment
Diversity and inclusion are anchored  
in our recruitment approach, from 
selecting the sources of recruitment, 
screening applications and interviewing 
and hiring, to on-boarding, ongoing 
support mechanisms and development. 

Networking, support and 
mentoring
We believe in creating an inclusive and 
encouraging environment anchored in 
formal and informal support networks. 
We have plans to develop a women’s 
network to strengthen links between 
women working across IKEA, improve 
communication and support, and 
increase engagement.

Senior leadership 
representation in women’s 
empowerment network
Gillian Drakeford, Country Retail 
Manager IKEA UK and Ireland, has been 
part of the Retail Week Be Inspired 
Initiative since 2016. With the support of 
over 50 senior retail ambassadors, the 
initiative aims to develop future female 
leaders. The network provides support, 
contacts and mentorship, and monthly 
events equip new talent with the skills 
to turn inspiration into action.

Conclusion
Going through the process of 
preparing for the gender pay 
gap report has improved our 
understanding of our gender pay  
gap  and what we need to do to  
close it. Although our pay gap is 
smaller than the averages for the  
UK and the retail industry, we know 
there is still work to do. Through 
the holistic approach across IKEA 
Group and building on our inclusive 
culture and values, we are committed 
to finding new ways to achieve and 
maintain equality for every co-worker, 
no matter their gender, identity  
or background.
