Investing in our people ...  Our goal is to make A.G. BARR a great place to work, both now and in the future.  The safety of our people is our number one priority. We operate a thorough and varied safety management programme designed to keep safety at the top of our agenda.  Our activities range from safety awareness initiatives and behavioural safety training to site safety audits and reporting.  Underpinning everything that we do is our belief in performance through people.  We have developed a simple behavioural framework central to who we are and how we operate.  The four behaviours - Being Brilliant, Always Learning, Results Driven and Relationships that Deliver - represent the heart and soul of A.G. Barr and how we should work together to enhance performance in our developing business. Whether recruiting new employees or developing our existing teams, our Barr Behaviours are core to our thinking and ensure we are all focused on our performance potential.  Some of our People highlights include:   Living Wage Employer accreditation  Investor in People silver status across all our sites  78% overall engagement score in our most recent “Your Voice Matters” employee survey  Over 6,000 hours of learning delivered across our workforce in the last year supporting each employee’s Personal Development Plan.   Our Gender Pay Report 2017 is now available by clicking here . This report has been compiled in line with government legislation which requires all companies with 250 employees or more to publish a range of gender pay statistics.   The report outlines our results for Barr Soft Drinks, setting out where progress has been made in terms of diversity and inclusion, and areas where there is still work to do.  Every year we update on our recent corporate responsibility activity within our Annual Report. To learn more about "our people" progress please access our Annual and interim reports page.
