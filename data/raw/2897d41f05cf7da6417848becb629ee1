Contact                       Home /  About Us /  Social Responsibility /  Diversity     Diversity             Our People  At Irwin Mitchell, we celebrate the diversity of our people, our clients and the communities in which we operate. We know that our people are our biggest asset and as such, we are committed to creating an inclusive and supportive working environment in which our employees can flourish and our clients can prosper. The Our People strand is all about making this happen.  Overall, our aims are to:   Make Irwin Mitchell a â€˜great place to workâ€™ for all our people.  Create an inclusive and supportive culture  Build commitment to the diversity agenda throughout all levels of the firm  Provide our people with the opportunity to develop   If you're interested in joining us, visit our recruitment section .  Diversity  Irwin Mitchell is proud to be different.  We have a Partnership Diversity Board that is responsible for overseeing the practical implementation and continued development of the firmâ€™s diversity strategy. The Diversity Board is headed by Stuart Henderson, Regional Managing Partner and Board member.  Alongside this group, a number of internal listening groups have been established to focus on sexual orientation, age, gender, disability and race. Each group is led by a senior member of the Partnership andÂ work with external agencies and networks to explore a range of issues and initiatives that will contribute to the inclusiveness of Irwin Mitchell.  In August 2015Â we were shortlisted for the the 2015 Excellence in Diversity & Inclusion category at the Law Society Awards.   Wellbeing  It is important that the firm provides a working environment that nurtures employee wellbeing and so there are a number of policies/benefits in place that ensure the wellbeing of all our employees. These include:   Flexible Working  Health and safety  Holidays & Other absence  Sickness  Career Break  Family related absence  Staggered working  Bullying/Harassment  Maternity and Paternity  Health insurance  Discounted gym membership   We regularly facilitate â€˜stop smokingâ€™ clinics in our offices, supported by the NHS and local City Councils. We also provide our staff with the tools to maintain their financial wellbeing and have hosted the FSAâ€™s â€˜Make the most of your moneyâ€™ sessions at our offices across the country.  Our Future  Irwin Mitchell employs people from all areas of the community with varied academic or professional backgrounds. Unusually for a law firm, candidates applying to our Trainee programme are not screened by their academic qualifications.  Every one of our people plays a key role in developing the firm for the future, regardless of whether they are a lawyer or a member of the support team. For this reason, we provide structured career paths for both legal and non legal employees, giving the latter the opportunity to progress to the level of an Associate and Associate Director (equivalent to Partner level). For employees who are legally qualified non solicitors, we have also introduced the title of Partner as opposed to Associate Director recognising the key role that they play in the firm. This structure emphasises the value we have for all of our people.  We believe that it is good to celebrate success and so in addition to the annual performance review, employees are recognised and rewarded for going the extra mile via the Irwin Mitchell Employee Recognition Scheme.  Stonewall  The firm has been ranked in the top 100 businesses in the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index. In addition, we also hold a Star Performer award which recognises the fantastic work our employee network group, IMEqual, undertakes both internally and externally to raise awareness on key issues.Â We are a Diversity Champion for Stonewall and the firm is taking part in the Workplace Equality Index.
