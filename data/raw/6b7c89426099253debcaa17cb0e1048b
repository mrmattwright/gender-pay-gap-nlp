We are required by law to publish an annual gender pay gap report, based upon a snapshot date of 5th April annually.  The figures below have been calculated using the standard format required by legislation – the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. This is WESC’s report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.  Mean Gender Pay Gap  The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of men and women is 7%.  Median Gender Pay Gap  The difference between the median hourly rate of pay for men and women 0%.  Understanding our Gender Pay Gap  WESC Foundation’s workforce consists of 76% female employees and 24% male employees which is representative of the care sector. We have 49% of female employees working on a part time basis compared to just 13% of males working part time.  WESC Foundation is committed to the principle of equal opportunities for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability.  We operate a performance related pay system, the aim of this system is to ensure that pay reflects performance. Our principles are to pay our staff a fair salary that is competitive with the charity sector, proportionate to the complexity of each role and responsibility and in line with our charitable objectives.  We are therefore confident that the gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather the gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.
