Siemens has 11 legal entities which are in scope to report and we have prepared a consolidated report which covers Siemens 15,000-strong UK workforce.                Download report as PDF                      Download report as PDF                   You are here:   Overview                                                     We welcome the government regulation to report Gender Pay Gap data and we strive for significant improvement.          As a leader in digital infrastructure, industrial software, technology and engineering and in spite of our efforts to encourage women into science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) careers, we have an imbalanced population of employees with 79 per cent men and 21 per cent women. In addition, particularly in our more traditional businesses, we have more men in senior management and technical roles.         More  Close           ”    It’s crucial that we increase the number of women in our organisation and reduce the gender pay gap. With 46 per cent of the country’s working population being women, we are far from where we want to be. We need to hire, develop and grow everyone.       Simone Davina,  General Counsel, Diversity & Inclusion Ambassador, Siemens plc         Welcoming the publication of gender pay gap data, Juergen Maier, Chief Executive, Siemens plc said: “Publishing our gender pay gap is a great opportunity to use the data to set goals, share best practice and measure progress as every business leader in our company strives for significant improvement.”          ”    With all the tremendous progress we have made there is still much to do. We must be inclusive in everything we do. Anything else is just wrong and also a massive missed opportunity for business in driving high performance organisational cultures that foster innovation, customer focus, creativity, respect and responsibility at all levels.
