Gender pay is looking at the difference between the average earnings of men and women and we are confident that the systems we have in place ensure that men and women doing the same job receive equal pay.  For gender pay we are required to report on the following:   The average gender pay gap (using the mean and median)  The average gender bonus pay gap over a 12 month period  The proportion of males and females in each pay quartile   At Berneslai Homes we are committed to the fair treatment and reward of all staff irrespective of their gender.  For a full breakdown of our Gender Pay Gap, click here.
