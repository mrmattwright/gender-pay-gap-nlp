To determine the gender pay gap, the difference between the mean and median hourly rates of pay that men and female colleagues receive has to be calculated.  The mean pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings of men and women.  The median pay gap is the difference between the mid points in the ranges of hourly earnings of men and women.  It takes all salaries in the sample, lines them up in order from lowest to highest, and picks the middle salary.  Adare SEC’s Mean and Median Gender Pay Gap  Adare SEC’s mean gender pay gap is 20.88% and its median gender pay gap is 19.41%.  Within Adare SEC, there were more men at senior levels and a significantly larger proportion of women in our more junior roles in April 2017.  This means our average male salary at that given time (mean and median) was higher than our average female salary.  The charts below show the gender distribution across Adare SEC in four equally sized hourly pay quartiles, each containing approximately 116 employees.   Overall, women represent 31% of Adare SEC employees but there are 54.7% of women in the lower pay quartile.  This shows there are more women in junior level roles.   Women are less represented in the higher pay quartiles due to proportionally more men being in senior level roles.  The majority of our bonus payments are due to an operations attendance bonus scheme which is equally open to men and women.  This has resulted in a 0% median bonus figure.  However, there are also bonus payments for sales staff where there is a higher proportion of senior men than women which affects the gender pay gap, giving a mean bonus pay result of 31.8%.   Going Forward  We are working hard to address the Gender Pay Gap imbalance through inclusive and diverse recruitment, including recruitment and selection training for managers to remove any unconscious bias and to ensure recruitment is based on the appropriate competencies required for the role.  We also offer flexible working and are considering extending this to benefit more people including at senior levels in the business which may help to address the gender imbalance at this level.  Addressing the disparity in gender representation at senior levels will take time but it will help to close the current gender pay gap within Adare SEC.
