This data is published below and also on the central Government Portal where it is stored and comparisons can be made with all other organisations across the country.  Gender Pay Gap Data  In addition to complying fully with our legal responsibilities for reporting, this data will also form part of our ongoing commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion as demonstrated through our organisational values which are Ambition, Integrity, Inclusion, Responsiveness and Courage. The following data was gathered following the ACAS guide to managing gender pay reporting and the legislation that requires us to publish. The ‘Mean’ Gender Pay Gap To reach the figure of the Mean (average) pay gap between males and females, the hourly rates of male and females employed by us at 31st March 2017 were used to calculate the average hourly salary for each. The gap between then is the mean gender pay gap. For Oldham College the mean pay gap is 10.41% which The ‘Median’ Gender Pay Gap The Median (mid-point) pay gap is calculated by listing all hourly rates for males and females from the highest to the lowest, and then selecting the hourly rate that is at the mid-point of that list. For Oldham College the median (mid-point) pay gap is 14.55% which means that the hourly rate at the centre of our salary ranges is 14,55% higher for males in the College. Pay Quartiles The proportion of males and females in the four quartiles of the pay bands is calculated by listing all salaries (hourly rates) from highest to lowest. This list is then split into four equal sections. A breakdown of the proportion of males and females in the four quartiles is as follows:    PAY QUARTILES How many men and women are in each quarter of the employer         Males  Females    UPPER QUARTILE  39.5%  60.5%    UPPER MIDDLE QUARTILE  46.6%  53.4%    LOWER MIDDLE QUARTILE  28.0%  72.0%    LOWER QUARTILE  21.9%  78.1%    What will we do now? For many years, the College has had a clear and transparent pay framework, with the aim of being clear and fair when rewarding staff. Whilst our pay gap is similar to many organisations and close to the national averages, we will continue to review this and to report the data on an annual basis.
