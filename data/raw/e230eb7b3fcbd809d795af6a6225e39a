Nowadays, more than one billion people put their trust in the safety of our products on a daily basis, and this means we bear a special responsibility that extends to all aspects of our business – not just the provision of safe, reliable and efficient products and technologies but also our manufacturing processes, which have to meet the most rigorous safety, quality and environmental standards. As a globally operating company, we also see it as our task to ensure compliance with human rights and recognized work standards at all our sites and to demonstrate global social commitment. As a family-owned company, we have always looked to the future - which is why we are determined to make a contribution in our field towards sustainable economic, environmental and social development. We understand sustainability to be the incorporation of financial, social and environmental aspects into our business activities. This means that as a company we not only assume social responsibility but also strengthen our long-term business orientation. Responsible conduct is an important element in securing the company’s future.
