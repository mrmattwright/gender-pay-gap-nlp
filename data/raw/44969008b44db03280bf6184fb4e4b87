We welcome the Government’s efforts to improve transparency in gender equality and pay in the workplace. Understanding what drives our gender pay gap is just one step on our journey to continually improve the diversity of our global team. In the words of our Chairman and CEO, Dave Ricks; “Diversity and Inclusion are business imperatives at Lilly. It’s up to all of us to respect diversity and be more inclusive so we can continue to make life better and better for patients and our customers.”  The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men and women across all roles and is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings. All UK companies with 250 or more employees are required to report their gender pay gap annually, beginning April 2018. It is important to remember that “gender pay” is not the same as “equal pay”, which is the right of men and women to be paid at a similar rate for work of equivalent value and has been law in the UK since 1970.  At Lilly UK, our mean gender pay gap is 3.9% with a median pay gap of -0.3%. On average this means that across Lilly in the UK, women are paid 3.9% less than men, and at the median slightly more than men.
