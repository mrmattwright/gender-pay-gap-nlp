Our analysis shows that the overall difference between men and women’s earnings is 19.4% (mean) or 17% (median), based on hourly rates of pay at the snapshot date of 5 April, 2017. Like many others, our gap is primarily caused by having fewer women in senior grades and highly paid technical roles. When we compare pay for equal or similar work across our organisation, the gap is significantly lower at 1.6%.  While we have a way to go, we are making good progress – from boosting our UK Board of Directors to 43% women to welcoming in our first 50% female graduate intake. We are confident that as we make progress towards achieving greater gender balance in our senior roles and technical roles, our gender pay gap will reduce.
