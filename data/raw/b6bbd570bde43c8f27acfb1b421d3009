It is our Policy to recruit the best person for each vacancy regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership. The Trust is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination and to the equal treatment of all employees and job applicants, and requires all staff to abide by this principle. It is the duty of all employees to accept their personal responsibility for the practical application of the policy, but the Trust acknowledges that specific responsibilities fall upon management, supervisors and individuals involved in recruitment. The Trust believes that people should be valued as individuals and is committed to all employees being able to achieve their full potential in an environment characterised by dignity and mutual respect and where individual differences and contributions of staff are recognised and valued. The Trust is committed to the promotion of equal opportunities and building equality and diversity into its policies, procedures and practices. It will keep under review its policies, procedures and practices to ensure that people are not disadvantaged. The Trust recognises that equality in the workplace cannot be achieved through an Equal Opportunities Policy alone. The policy forms the core statement of the Trust’s philosophy and underpins commitments to achieve equality and fairness at work and other relevant policies are in place to support this policy. Workforce profile The link on this page provides an overview of the composition of staff employed by Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust. This information has been extracted from the Trust Electronic Staff Record System. The information found here is likely to change over time, so please be  mindful that this is a living document and the data is only correct at  the time of publication. Workforce Race Equality Standard The NHS Equality and Diversity Council has announced a series of measures, starting in April 2015,  to be taken across the NHS to ensure employees from black and ethnic minority (BME) backgrounds have equal access to career opportunities and receive fair treatment in the workplace. This follows recent reports which have highlighted disparities in the number of BME people in senior leadership positions across the NHS, as well as lower levels of wellbeing amongst the BME population. The Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) is one of these measures. It requires Trusts to demonstrate progress against a number of indicators of workforce equality, including a specific indicator to address the low levels of Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Board representation. The standard will highlight any differences between the experience and treatment of White staff and BME staff in the NHS with a view to closing those metrics. We have  published our  baseline 2015 position on the metrics,  which can be seen in the ‘useful downloads’ above, as well as at the end of this section. We are working to understand the issues, and to address the areas for improvement  identified by the indicators, and we will be updating the website with the position at April 2016 for comparison.

Gender Pay Reporting The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 set out a public authority’s gender pay gap reporting duties, which form part of its public sector equality duty under the Equality Act. These duties mean that we are obliged to publish information about the gender split of our workforce, the differences in mean and median hourly pay rates between genders, the gender profile of the organization split into quartiles, and the differences in bonus pay between genders. The data has to be published by 30 March 2018 and is at a snapshot date of 31 March 2017 . We are required to publish the information on the Gov.uk website – which only enables us to publish the statistical information. We are also required to publish the information on our own webpages, and here we can add a narrative to describe the statistical information. Our Gender Pay reporting statistics and narrative can be seen in the ‘useful downloads’ above. What is the difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap? The gender pay gap differs from equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value . It looks at individuals. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. Because the NHS uses structured national pay frameworks, it is unlikely that we will identify any equal pay issues. The gender pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women . If a workplace has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with, and the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are. It may be that there is an uneven distribution of genders at different levels of the organisation.
