The information below is based on the requirement date of 5 th April 2017.    Our overall mean gender pay gap is 7.7%    Pay Information     Mean hourly pay difference between male and female employees  7.70%    Median hourly pay difference between male and female employees  2.70%       Florette UK & Ireland’s gender pay gap is significantly lower than the National Average of 18%. The factory team are paid the same rate according to which job they do. There is no difference between the rates paid to men and women. Night workers receive 20% uplift on the day rate. As the night teams are predominantly male this contributes towards the median hourly pay difference.    Gender split – pay quartiles     Gender split  Lower Quartile  Low Mid Quartile  Upper Mid Quartile  Upper Quartile  Total    Male  53%  81%  63%  71%  67%    Female  47%  19%  37%  29%  33%       The pay quartiles on the left show the proportion of male and female employees in each of the quartile pay bands. At entry level the split between male and female is fairly even.   At a senior level there is a higher representation of males versus females.  This is an area of focus for the business.    Bonus information     Mean bonus difference between male and female employees  16.6%    Median bonus difference between male and female employees  8%    Percentage of men and women who were paid bonus pay within a 12 month period  100%       Bonuses based on Key Performance Indicators are paid to all employees.  For those on maternity or part time it is pro rata. This explains why the median is different for male and female.  Mean bonus difference is related to higher percentage of male employees in upper quartile roles.    What have we done so far  The Company has worked with the KornFerry Hay Group to undertake a job evaluation programme across sites to enable us to assess the value of each role in the business.  A simple grading scheme has also been put in place in the factory, with pay rates allocated to each grade.    What we are doing next  We are actively looking at ways to address the gender split throughout the business.Pay benchmarking is to take place in line with the Korn Ferry Hay evaluation. As an employer we want to employ the best person for the job and pay above average rates to attract talent. We are also looking at flexible working options to encourage new ways of working.    I confirm the information published above is accurate.    Signed: D.
