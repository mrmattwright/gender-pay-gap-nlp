Understanding the gap
Countrystyle’s gender pay gap reﬂ ects trends in employment within the Waste Management sector. 
Operational roles (including drivers) which represent a high percentage of jobs within Countrystyle have 
traditionally been ﬁ lled by male members of staff. 

I conﬁ rm that the data reported is accurate.
