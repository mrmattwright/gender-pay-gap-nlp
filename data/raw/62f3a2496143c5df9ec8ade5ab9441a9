The above table shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date 5 April 2017.  
It also shows the mean and median difference in bonuses paid to men and women in the 12 months reference period to 5 April 2017.

Our overall company specific gender pay gap is 15% (below the UK average of 18.1%). This is largely driven by the greater number 
of men that we have in the upper quartile and conversely the larger proportion of women that hold corporate support clerical 
positions in the lower quartile.

Our bonus is predominantly commission based with a more traditional bonus scheme operating in corporate support roles. 
The bonus gap is explained by two predominant factors:

 A higher proportion of men work in our technology practices 
where industry salaries are greater; this leads to a higher 
commission being paid on a like for like placement in other 
practices

 18% of the women who were paid a bonus work part 
time hours; this inevitably reflects in the amount of 
commission they can earn.

The corporate support bonus scheme did not pay out during the reference period. If we adjust for this factor the proportion of 
men and women receiving bonus changes to 84.6% and 82.8% respectively. 

Our commission system is transparent, straight-forward and inclusive.

We are confident that men and women are paid and bonused equally for doing equivalent jobs.  

Inclusion of temporary workers provided to our clients

As a recruitment business we are required to report data inclusive of the temporary staff that we provide to our clients although 
we have little control over the pay and bonus rates of this group of people. The combined statistics are shown below.
