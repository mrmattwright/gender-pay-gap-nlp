In April 2017 the ‘Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017’ for private 
and voluntary-sector employers came into force requiring all private and voluntary-sector 
employers with 250 or more employees to publish prescribed information about their gender pay 
gap results. 
  
We set out below that information along with a brief commentary about the data. 
 
1.  The mean gender pay gap is 16.5% 
2.  The median gender pay gap is 14.8%  
3.  The mean gender bonus gap is 21.8% 
4.  The median gender bonus gap is 62.5% 
5.  The percentage of: 

  male employees receiving a bonus is 3.6% 
 

female employees receiving a bonus is 1.2% 

  
6.    The pay quartiles percentages (number of employees in each band) are:

 Explanatory Notes: 
 
A Gender Pay Gap is not the same as an Equal Pay Gap. The latter refers to the difference between 
men and women’s pay for the same job and is illegal. The Gender Pay Gap relates to the difference 
calculated between average earnings irrespective of roles. 
 
The Group employs more women than men in total and in each pay quartile. However, a high 
proportion of women work in administrative (broadly, non - teaching) or T.A. roles which are 
generally lower paid than many teaching positions. This underscores the importance of the type of 
role a person is in as being a significant cause of the overall Gender Pay Gap. 
 
The Group only pays a small number of bonus payments in any one year and so a slight change in 
the bonus profile in any one year has a significant impact on the distribution.
