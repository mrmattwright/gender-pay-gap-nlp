Gender Pay Gap Statement as of 5th April 2017 

Introduction 

The Gender Pay Gap report shows the difference between the average earnings of men and women across 
the workforce, irrespective of role, seniority or length of service.  As such this is a different calculation to 
equal pay, which compares the salary paid to men and women carrying out the same job.   

We are confident that we pay men and women the same for carrying out the same roles and we are 
confident, through our review process, that we are advancing colleagues without reference to gender.  

Acturis data 

The mean (average) pay gap between men and women at Acturis by pay quartile is: 

Mean (where positive numbers favour men)  

 
This shows that there is no meaningful difference in the lower three quartiles (in fact in the upper middle 
quartile the female average pay is higher than the male average pay) but the gap in the upper quartile is 
largest due to the male/female balance at the most senior levels in the company.  Our overall mean gender 
pay gap of 18.19% is in line with other technology companies; the ONS benchmark mean gender pay gap for 
2017 for companies in the sector “Computer Programming, Consultancy and related activities” is 19.6%. 
 

The ratio of male to female colleagues in each pay quartile at Acturis is:

Males 
86.30% 
78.08% 
69.44% 
64.38% 
74.57% 

Females 
13.70% 
21.92% 
30.56% 
35.62% 
25.43% 

This overall ratio of male to female colleagues is in line with other companies in the technology sector and 
reflects the proportion of graduates studying STEM subjects and pursuing a career in software.  In fact, at 
the lower quartiles Acturis has a better representation of females than UK STEM graduates, but this drops at 
the most senior levels. 

The percentage of colleagues who receive a bonus is:

Females

This shows that Acturis does not have a difference in bonus approach based on gender. However, again the 
male/female balance at the most senior levels in the company results in a mean bonus gap of 48.01%, and a 
median bonus gap of 16.32% as more senior colleagues have a higher overall bonus opportunity. 

As of 5th April 2017, our gender pay gap information is shown below:

While there is a gender pay gap in terms of both hourly pay and bonus payments, further analysis as 
discussed above shows that virtually all of this gap arises because women hold fewer senior positions and 
have, on average, shorter tenure within the company than men. This difference in tenure and seniority flows 
directly into base salary levels and target bonus percentages since target bonus increases with tenure and 
seniority in the company.  
 
Our plans for the future 
 
Acturis is committed to helping our colleagues achieve their potential throughout their career and we are 
already focussed on actively supporting the professional development of our talent, regardless of gender.  
We recognise that any gender pay gap is disappointing, and we are determined to reduce our gender pay 
and bonus gaps.  We are reviewing our approach to retention and development with a view to closing the 
gaps over time. 
 
 
I confirm the gender pay gap data to be accurate.
