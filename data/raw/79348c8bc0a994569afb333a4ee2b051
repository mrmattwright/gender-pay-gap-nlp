 
GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

 

GreenZone  Cleaning  &  Support  Services  is  required  by  law  to  publish  an  annual  gender  pay  gap 
report. This is its report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017. 

We are committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, 
regardless of  sex,  race,  religion or belief,  age,  marriage  or  civil  partnership,  pregnancy/maternity, 
sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. We  have a  clear policy of paying employees 
equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out 
above).   

We are confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently 
for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men 
and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.  

The  figures  set  out  below  have  been  calculated  using  the  standard  methodologies  used  in  the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  

 

Summary 

  The mean Gender Pay Gap is 3.1% 
  The median Gender Pay Gap is 2.6 % 
  The mean bonus Gender Pay Gap is 11.1 % 
  The median bonus Gender Pay Gap is 0% 
  The proportion of males receiving a bonus payment is 6.5% 
  The proportion of females receiving a bonus payment is 5% 
 
  Proportion of males and females in each quartile

Breakdown by Categories 

 

 

At the snapshot date of 5 April 2017 GreenZone Cleaning & Support Services employed a total 308    

(42.2 %) males and 420 (57.7%) females across the organisation in a variety of roles. 

 

1.  Gender Pay Gap 

 
Mean 
Median 
 

Male 
£8.71 
£7.50 

Female 
£8.44 
£7.70 

Difference 
3.1 % 
2.6 % 

On average female employees earned 3.1% less than men overall including Head Office staff.  The 
difference  is  even  lower  when  we  look  at  the  numbers  for  our  core  business  group  –  cleaning 
operatives where the mean average of 1.8% and the median is 0%.  

This is a positive result considering that the national UK Gender Pay Gap currently stands at 9.1 %.   

 

2.  Bonus Pay Gap 

 
Mean 
Median 
 

Difference 
11.1% 
0.0% 

Whilst the Mean Bonus Pay Gap shows a difference of 11.1% between male and female employees, 
the Median Bonus Pay Gap shows a 0.0%.  

Across the UK economy as a whole, men are more likely than women to be in senior roles (especially 
very senior roles at the top of organisations), and this is also the case in our organisation as reflected 
on our mean bonus pay gap (11.1%). However,  the median bonus pay gap (0.0%) shows that overall 
across  the  company,  bonuses  are  balanced  and  reflect  no  difference  between  male  and  female 
employees.

3.  Proportion of Men/Women Receiving a Bonus 

 
Number receiving 
bonus 
 

Male  
6.5% 

Female 
5% 

 

It should be noted that only Head Office employees, following successful completion of the 
probationary period, qualify to earn a bonus.  On 5th April 2017, all qualifying employees received 
their bonus payment (20 males and 21 females) 

Based on this, we can say that 100% of Head office employees, both male and female, received a 
bonus.

We can see a higher percentage of women across the quartiles which appears to be in line with the 
overall employee female/male demographics.  

The Lower, Lower middle and Upper middle quartiles include cleaning operatives earning NMW and 
therefore these three categories  could be treated as one.  The Upper Quartile includes operatives 
earning above NMW,  operatives  earning  LLW  and  Head  Office  employees.  It is  worth  noting  that 
higher wages in certain contracts, including LLW are dictated by the client and not by the Company.

What is GreenZone doing to address its gender pay gap? 

 

While our gender pay gap compares favourably with that of organisations both across the whole UK 
economy and within our sector, GreenZone is committed to doing everything that it can to reduce 
the gap. However, GreenZone also recognises that its scope to act is limited in some areas - it has, 
for  example,  no  direct  control  over  the  subjects  that  individuals  choose  to  study  or  the  career 
choices that they make. 

 

I, Steve Trew, Managing Director, confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
