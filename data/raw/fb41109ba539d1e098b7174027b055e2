2018/23

LUNG CANCER PATHWAY – QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

Dr Anant Patel, consultant respiratory physician, and Ms Juliet Shavin, senior 
operations manager, respiratory, diabetes & endocrinology were in attendance 
for this item. 

Dr Patel noted that lung cancer had previously been a Cinderella service 
nationally, often assigned to the most junior consultants in a department.  It was 
currently the biggest cancer killer in the UK and he was pleased to say had in 
recent time received more attention and investment and there was now a much 
higher level of clinician engagement. 

The lung cancer pathway had been complex, with a high number of referrals 
meaning that clinics were overbooked, with limited time to give patients the 
information they needed.  The pathway work had centred on the aim of patients 
being diagnosed, understanding and being able to decide on the best treatment 
by day 38 so that they could be treated by day 62.  A strong multidisciplinary 
team was in place and Dr Patel commented that part of the success of the 
project had been due to the very effective way that clinicians and operational 
staff had worked together. 

Rather than all patients referred being seen initially at an outpatient clinic, the 
first step of the new pathway was for the patient to have a CT scan; following 
which the patient would be placed on the appropriate pathway.  This had 
resulted in patients with a non-cancer diagnosis receiving this within an average 
of 12 days from their referral.  It had also resulted in less congested clinics 
allowing more time for discussions to take place with patients and had reduced 
the number of ad hoc (extra) clinics saving probably £50,000. 

Ms Goldwag, non-executive director, asked about the impact on the other 
services to which patients were being diverted.  Dr Patel responded that this was 

2            

Paper 2 

primarily respiratory physician colleagues, who had been involved in the 
pathway redesign and who were very happy with the patients being seen in the 
right clinic. 

The group chief medical officer noted that the changes did not appear to have 
created supply led demand and therefore there was potentially some spare 
capacity.  He asked if there was a conversation to be had with primary care 
about increasing referral rates given that late referrals was one of the key issues 
with lung cancer. 

Dr Patel responded that discussions had taken place with colleagues in 
Camden.  The lung cancer team also provided a telephone advice line for GPs.  
He added that the future for early lung cancer diagnosis lay in screening.  The 
trust would be participating in a trial which was taking place shortly at Finchley 
Memorial Hospital which would involve approximately 100,000 people being 
scanned.  He also mentioned referrals from other specialties within the hospital, 
which took place if anything suspicious was noted on x-ray or scans. 

Ms Owen, non-executive director, was pleased to hear that there would be an 
audit of patient experience and asked about any plans to make patient 
experience part of the service design process rather than being brought in 
nearer the end.  Dr Patel responded that three patients had been approached to 
do precisely this.  Ms Shavin added that there was a national cancer patients’ 
survey the results of which were reflected in pathway redesign. 

Mr Ainger, non-executive director, asked about communications between quality 
improvement (QI) and clinical practice group (CPG) projects and Ms Shavin 
responded that there was contact between the groups as part of the project.  
The group chief executive added that the group director of quality was currently 
mapping QI and CPG projects, reviewing how to better incorporate patient 
engagement and how to ensure learning between projects. 

The chairman thanked Dr Patel and Ms Shavin for attending.  The presentation 
had been a great demonstration of the real benefits of QI for patients, for staff 
engagement and for cost reduction.   

2018/24

GO SEE VISITS

Group chief 
finance 
officer 

The director of corporate affairs reported on her go see visit to the eating 
disorders service, which was part of the child and adolescent mental health 
service (CAMHS).  The service took a holistic approach to the treatment of 
children and young people (between the ages of 6-18) suffering from eating 
disorders.  The service had recently moved to new accommodation at Queen 
Mary’s House which had been an improvement on their previous base; however 
they missed the proximity to departments in the main hospital.  The service 
received great feedback from patients and families, and had received no 
complaints for some years. 

Ms Owen, non-executive director, then fed back on a visit she had undertaken to 
the QI project on reducing urinary tract infection (UTI) which was a topic that she 
had been raising when the board discussed infection prevention and control.   
This was interesting work using the QI methodology.  The team had developed a 
reduction strategy including a daily nurse assessment of catheter use and a 
patient passport. This was currently being piloted on 5 East at the Royal Free 

3            

Paper 2 

Hospital and Cedar ward at Barnet Hospital.  There was now 100% compliance 
with catheter stewardship at the Royal Free Hospital and 97% at Barnet Hospital 
and Chase Farm Hospital. 

The future challenge was that although there was a target reduction across the 
health economy, there was no resource/input from CCGs and therefore no reach 
into nursing homes or to assist people at home.  Another frustration was having 
to collect data manually and the aspiration was to move to a paperless system 
with real time data. Finally, some patient engagement had taken place but there 
was a recognition that it would be beneficial to build engagement into the design 
phase of the work as well. 

The board then had a discussion about whether the board should continue to 
hear patients’ stories and it was agreed to do this in addition to feedback from 
the go see visits. 

The group chief finance officer would present the patients’ stories item next time. 

2018/25

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPORT

The group chief finance officer presented this report, noting that at the end of 
January, the trust had reported a deficit of £6.3m for the month and a year to 
date deficit of £15.2m, which was £40.9m favourable to plan. This reported 
position was before the impact of sustainability and transformation funding 
(STF).  Better than planned performance was due to early receipt of profit from 
sale of Parcel B and £0.9m of winter pressures funding.  She added that 
financial performance was very similar in January to December with continuing 
underperformance on elective and day case activity and the impact of marginal 
rate being paid on some over activity.   There was also under recovery of private 
patient income resulting in a loss in contribution of £2.5m.  Finally, there was 
slippage against the financial improvement plan (FIP) target and insufficient 
recurrent cost was being driven out.  

She reported that performance improvement meetings had taken place with the 
hospital executive teams the previous day to discuss recovery plans and actions 
for the last two months of the financial year.  She noted that the FIP contained 
the usual ‘hockey stick’ at the year end with a number of non-recurrent items to 
be brought into the accounts in month 12.  These included a number of balance 
sheet and provision measures which were detailed in the report.  

She noted that the 2017/18 financial plan included delivery of £44.7m FIP 
savings. At the end of January, the trust delivered £26.0m of FIP against a year 
to date target of £34.1m. The trust was currently forecasting to deliver £44.2m of 
FIP including £5.6m recovery actions. 

The group chief finance officer noted that the trust had started the year with an 
underlying deficit of £120m, with a plan to reduce this to £90-95m.  However, her 
view was that the trust would finish the year with an underlying deficit higher 
than £95m. 

Finally, the team was working hard on  for 2018/19.  

The group chief finance officer then advised the board that, as part of the Chase 
Farm Parcel B sale, the trust had agreed to hold £1m in an escrow style account 
as security to ensure vacant possession of the site was provided. This had been

discussed and agreed at the group services and investment committee (GSIC) in 
December 2017.  The £1m would only be repaid from the account when the trust 
provided vacant possession (July 2019 or as a long-stop March 2020.  She

Approved the setting up a new bank account to be held jointly with the Education 
and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). 
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE REPORT

2018/26

The group director of planning presented this report and noted that, because of 
the timing of the report and of the meeting, the January referral to treatment 
(RTT) and cancer figures were not yet available.  The trust had met the cancer 
62 day standard (85% of patients should receive a first definitive cancer 
treatment within 62 days of their urgent GP referral) in December and for quarter 
3 as a whole.  The backlog had been 103 at the last meeting and was now 87; 
however the trust’s internal target was for the backlog to be no more than 46 
cases.  As previously reported to the January board meeting, the remaining 
backlog meant that the January and February performance was likely to be in 
the range of 81-83%.  Regular meetings were taking place with the cancer 
teams and the backlog was being managed to an individual patient level.   

The group director of planning then reported on the position on referral to 
treatment time (RTT), which had been 86.7% in December.  The January figure 
was not yet known, but was likely to be lower than this.  Strong governance was 
in place, along with an action plan and trajectory and it was currently anticipated 
that the trust would return to compliance in August this year.  The trust continued 
to focus on treating the longest waiting patients and all patients who had waited 
more than 52 weeks were being individually tracked.  It was hoped that the 
majority of patients would be treated by the end of February, leaving a small 
number to be treated in March.  The chief executive – Royal Free Hospital noted 
that the clinical harm process was in place and so far 107 reviews had been 
undertaken, with no harm or low harm identified in all cases.   

Regarding A&E, the target for which was that at least 95% of patients attending 
an A&E department must be seen, treated, and admitted or discharged in under 
four hours, trust performance for January was 86.1% which was an improvement 
on the December figure.  The overall trend continued to one of slight 
improvement but sustainability remained the issue. 

Mr Ainger, non-executive director, asked for more information about the data 
warehouse failures.  The group chief information officer advised that the data 
warehouse was programmed for replacement.  The group chief executive added 
that this was a high risk situation but that all possible mitigations had been put in 
place. 

The board noted the current operational performance of the trust.

CHAIR’S AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT

Paper 2 

The group chief executive highlighted the achievement of 70% of staff having the 
flu vaccination which was a first and reflected very hard work and commitment 
by the nursing leadership.  However, this was more than a target; lives would be 
saved and the number of infections would be reduced.  He also noted that the 
Pears building construction would start on 12 March 2018 and the slip road 
would close on 27 February 2018.

QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC 

Mr Bedford, patient governor, asked about ambulance handover times as he had 
recently waited an hour and a half to be transferred from an ambulance to the 
emergency department, although every other aspect of his inpatient stay had 
been excellent.  The group chief executive apologised for his poor patient 
experience and said that reducing ambulance handover times was a real priority 
for the trust, both in terms of improving patients’ experience and enabling 
ambulances to get back on the road to attend to other patients.  Recent figures 
from NHS England indicated that the Royal Free London was the most improved 
trust in London for ambulance handover, and as a result one of the best in 
London.

GO SEE VISITS 

Executive summary 

The board agreed to a new approach to go see visits at its December 2017 meeting, building 
on the previous programme of go see visits designed to increase visibility and engagement 
between trust leaders and governors with staff.  

Go see visits are open to all group directors, including site chief executives, non-executive 
directors and governors. They will take place monthly and ‘visit’ all areas of the trust, 
including corporate support services. Prior to the visits, a fact sheet will be provided giving 
some key information about the areas. This will include information on staffing and where 
appropriate, patient or client feedback. The current sheet is in the process of being reviewed.  
Visits are not designed to be inspections, but opportunities to listen to staff and where 
appropriate, meet patients.  

While non-executives will continue to be paired with governors, executive directors will visit a 
separate set of areas.  

Three key questions will be asked: 

1. 
2. 
3. 

What is working? 
What is not working? 
What would you like to change? 

This information will be fed back verbally at the following trust board meeting. Logistically 
this will mean there is feedback from more than one area. This will be dealt with by a list of 
areas visited being circulated in the papers and the chairman asking for any specific areas to 
be highlighted. 

The following visits have taken place since the last board meeting.

National Staff Survey 2017 – summary of results  

Executive summary
This paper provides the Board a summary of the 2017 national staff survey results. A more detailed report 
and recommended actions will be discussed at Quality Improvement and Leadership (QIL) committee on 
26th March 2018.  

Overall the trust’s performance can be described as ‘average’ in a year where overall NHS performance in 
the survey has declined in 2/3rds of the 32 key findings examined and in the majority of questions (58 out 
of 94). The trust continues to see a long term trend of improvement, but this has not been sufficient to 
have taken us into above average performance in more areas. The issues raised in the 2017 report do not 
differ substantially from those reported in 2016.  

The main change has been a 5% reduction in the reported rate of appraisals which is thought to be linked 
to the re-organisation into the group model. 

Key areas of focus in improving staff experience remain: 

•  Bullying and harassment 
•  Teamworking 
•  Appraisal, feedback and development 
•  Management support form immediate managers 
•  Health and wellbeing (including flexible working) 

Action required/recommendation
The Board is asked to note the report and that a detailed discussion will take place at QIL on 26 March 
2018.

Paper 61. Introduction 

The national staff survey 2017 was conducted between the dates of 3rd October 2017 – 1st December 
2017. Of 8823 eligible staff, 4157 staff completed the survey. The response rate was 47.1%, which is 
is 5% higher than 42% in 2016. 

Across the NHS the response rate for Acute Trusts in 2017 was 45.4%, 1% higher than 2016 (44%). 

This  report  outlines  briefly  the  NHS  national  picture,  early  comparison  with  other  NHS  trusts,  the 
Royal Free London (RFL) overall results position. The internal hospital unit comparison for 2017 and 
detailed  analysis of each ‘key finding’  will be shared  with the Quality Improvement and Leadership 
committee (QIL) and hospital leadership teams.  

2. National picture 

2017 was the 15th annual national survey of NHS staff. Approximately 1.1million NHS employees 
were invited to participate. 309 NHS organisations took part. 487,227 staff responded (45% response 
rate). 

A summary of the national picture is shown below: 

The  national  findings  show  a  decline  in  staff  engagement  (to  3.79  from  3.8  in  2016)  for  all  three 
components at a national level:  

  KF1 –  Staff recommendation of the trust as a place to work or receive treatment: 3.74(down 

  KF4 –  Staff motivation at work: 3.90(down from 3.92) 
  KF7 –  Percentage of staff able to contribute towards improvements at work: 69.6% (down 

from 3.75) 

from   70.3%) 

This  is  the  first  decline  in  engagement  since  2014.  Acute  specialist  trusts  have  the  highest 
engagement (3.93), although this has declined since 2016 (3.9)

Paper 63. The RFL NHS staff survey results  

3.1 Staff engagement 

The trusts staff engagement score of 3.81 is average when compared with other trusts. There has 
been  a  small  increase  in  the  staff  engagement  score  from  3.8  (2016)  to  3.81(2017)  against  a 
background of a small national decline.

Paper 65. Overall summary 

The trust has a goal of being top 10% of peers in staff recommending the organisation as a place to 
work and generally delivering best in class performance on workforce development, health and 
wellbeing and staff satisfaction.  

The context of the 2017 survey has been a challenging national background with dissatisfaction about 
pay, inexorable rise in demand and significant focus on the ‘strain’ the NHS is under. 

Locally the trust embarked on the launch of the RFL group, the establishment of group and hospital 
leadership teams and the associated re-organisation of structures and managerial responsibilities. 
There were also a number of other change programmes (eg payroll outsourcing, pathology transfer to 
HSL, new RFH ED etc), which, on top of the general operational pressures facing all trusts, have 
created an environment of regular change in which improving staff engagement and satisfaction 
remains challenging. The programmes of clinical practice group (CPG) work, quality improvement (QI) 
initiatives etc which are new areas where staff engagement can be supported to improve were just 
getting started. 

Overall, in that context, the results are not surprising and certainly do not represent any significant 
deterioration in performance. There are some modest improvements in some particular questions that 
may point to initiatives on bullying and harassment and ‘speaking up’ starting to impact – the 
percentage of staff/ colleagues reporting most recent experience of harassment, bullying or abuse 
has increased - but should be taken only as an early indicator. 

Appendix 1 is an analysis conducted by ‘Listening into Action’ which plots trusts against their scores 
above and below average and number of scores with an improving trend. The RFL has a good rate of 
improvement (in 20 key findings) but has further to travel to get more scores above average.   

The next steps are for QIL to consider in detail the survey findings (including details for each key 
finding, results analysed by hospital/unit and some of the themes from narrative submitted by staff) 
and to update planned actions on staff engagement and retention – it is meeting is on 26th March.

Paper 6Appendix 1: 2017 Listening into Action blog Scatter Map of National Staff Survey results for all 
Acute Trusts 

The  trust  has  remained  within  the  second  worst  quadrant  'bottom  right'  for  2017:  below  median 
outcomes but with encouraging level of improvement year on year. All trusts' results are reflected at a 
grid reference on a 32 by 32 ‘Scatter Map’ that shows how staff have rated the trust’s leadership and 
culture  over  the  past  year.  The  higher  up  you  are,  the  better  your  trust  is  performing  against  your 
peers in the eyes of your staff. The further to the right you are, the more positive your trend, year-on-
year. So, the best quadrant to find your trust in is 'top right': an above average performance and a 
positive trend.

Paper 61. Introduction to this report

This report presents the findings of the 2017 national NHS staff survey conducted in Royal Free
London NHS Foundation Trust.

In section 2 of this report, we present an overall indicator of staff engagement. Full details of how
this indicator was created can be found in the document Making sense of your staff survey
data, which can be downloaded from www.nhsstaffsurveys.com.

In sections 3 and 4 of this report, the findings of the questionnaire have been summarised and
presented in the form of 32 Key Findings.

Appraisals & support for development
Equality & diversity
Errors & incidents

These sections of the report have been structured thematically so that Key Findings are grouped
appropriately. There are nine themes within this report:
•
•
•
• Health and wellbeing
• Working patterns
•
• Managers
•
•
Please note, two Key Findings have had their calculation changed and there have been minor
changes to the benchmarking groups for social enterprises since last year. For more detail on
these changes, please see the Making sense of your staff survey data document.

Job satisfaction

Patient care & experience
Violence, harassment & bullying

As in previous years, there are two types of Key Finding:

-

-

percentage scores, i.e. percentage of staff giving a particular response to one, or a
series of, survey questions

scale summary scores, calculated by converting staff responses to particular
questions into scores. For each of these scale summary scores, the minimum score
is always 1 and the maximum score is 5

A longer and more detailed report of the 2017 survey results for Royal Free London NHS
Foundation Trust can be downloaded from: www.nhsstaffsurveys.com. This report provides
detailed breakdowns of the Key Finding scores by directorate, occupational groups and
demographic groups, and details of each question included in the core questionnaire.

The scores presented below are un-weighted question level scores for questions Q21a, Q21b,
Q21c and Q21d and the un-weighted score for Key Finding 1. The percentages for Q21a – Q21d
are created by combining the responses for those who “Agree” and “Strongly Agree” compared
to the total number of staff that responded to the question.

Q21a, Q21c and Q21d feed into Key Finding 1 “Staff recommendation of the organisation as a
place to work or receive treatment”.

Paper 62. Overall indicator of staff engagement for Royal Free London NHS Foundation
Trust

The figure below shows how Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust compares with other
acute trusts on an overall indicator of staff engagement. Possible scores range from 1 to 5, with 1
indicating that staff are poorly engaged (with their work, their team and their trust) and 5 indicating
that staff are highly engaged. The trust's score of 3.81 was average when compared with trusts of
a similar type.
OVERALL STAFF ENGAGEMENT

This overall indicator of staff engagement has been calculated using the questions that make up
Key Findings 1, 4 and 7. These Key Findings relate to the following aspects of staff engagement:
staff members’ perceived ability to contribute to improvements at work (Key Finding 7); their
willingness to recommend the trust as a place to work or receive treatment (Key Finding 1); and
the extent to which they feel motivated and engaged with their work (Key Finding 4).

The table below shows how Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust compares with other acute
trusts on each of the sub-dimensions of staff engagement, and whether there has been a
significant change since the 2016 survey.

others as a place to work, and would be happy with the
standard of care provided by the trust if a friend or relative
needed treatment.)
KF4. Staff motivation at work
(the extent to which they look forward to going to work, and
are enthusiastic about and absorbed in their jobs.)
KF7. Staff ability to contribute towards
improvements at work
(the extent to which staff are able to make suggestions to
improve the work of their team, have frequent opportunities
to show initiative in their role, and are able to make
improvements at work.)

3.1 Top and Bottom Ranking Scores

This page highlights the five Key Findings for which Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust
compares most favourably with other acute trusts in England.

TOP FIVE RANKING SCORES

KF3. Percentage of staff agreeing that their role makes a difference to patients / service

users

KF13. Quality of non-mandatory training, learning or development

KF12. Quality of appraisals

KF27. Percentage of staff / colleagues reporting most recent experience of harassment,

bullying or abuse

KF2. Staff satisfaction with the quality of work and care they are able to deliver

Paper 6This page highlights the five Key Findings for which Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust
compares least favourably with other acute trusts in England. It is suggested that these areas
might be seen as a starting point for local action to improve as an employer.

BOTTOM FIVE RANKING SCORES

! KF21. Percentage of staff believing that the organisation provides equal opportunities
for career progression or promotion

! KF20. Percentage of staff experiencing discrimination at work in the last 12 months

! KF26. Percentage of staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in last
12 months

! KF17. Percentage of staff feeling unwell due to work related stress in the last 12 months

! KF23. Percentage of staff experiencing physical violence from staff in last 12 months

For each of the 32 Key Findings, the acute trusts in England were placed in order from 1 (the top ranking score) to 93
(the bottom ranking score). Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust’s five lowest ranking scores are presented
here, i.e. those for which the trust’s Key Finding score is ranked closest to 93. Further details about this can be found
in the document Making sense of your staff survey data.

Paper 63.2 Largest Local Changes since the 2016 Survey

This page highlights the two Key Findings where staff experiences have deteriorated since the
2016 survey. It is suggested that these areas might be seen as a starting point for local action to
improve as an employer.

WHERE STAFF EXPERIENCE HAS DETERIORATED

! KF11. Percentage of staff appraised in last 12 months

! KF25. Percentage of staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from patients,
relatives or the public in last 12 months

Because the Key Findings vary considerably in terms of subject matter and format (e.g. some are percentage scores,
others are scale scores), a straightforward comparison of score changes is not the appropriate way to establish which
Key Findings have deteriorated the most. Rather, the extent of 2016-2017 change for each Key Finding has been
measured in relation to the national variation for that Key Finding. Further details about this can be found in the
document Making sense of your staff survey data.

Paper 64. Key Findings for Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust

Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust had 4157 staff take part in this survey. This is a
response rate of 47%1 which is above average for acute trusts in England (44%), and compares
with a response rate of 42% in this trust in the 2016 survey.

This section presents each of the 32 Key Findings, using data from the trust's 2017 survey, and
compares these to other acute trusts in England and to the trust's performance in the 2016
survey. The findings are arranged under nine themes: appraisals and support for development,
equality and diversity, errors and incidents, health and wellbeing, working patterns, job
satisfaction, managers, patient care and experience , and violence, harassment and bullying.

Positive findings are indicated with a green arrow (e.g. where the trust is in the best 20% of
trusts, or where the score has improved since 2016). Negative findings are highlighted with a red
arrow (e.g. where the trust’s score is in the worst 20% of trusts, or where the score is not as
good as 2016). An equals sign indicates that there has been no change.

Gender pay gap (GPR) report 

Executive summary
This paper informs the trust board of the trust’s current position on the ‘gender pay gap’ (GPG). 
It shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men and women in 
the workforce. This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.  
As an employer of more than 250 staff the trust is obliged to publish its GPG analysis by 30 
March 2018. 
This report has also been discussed at the quality, improvement and leadership committee. 

Action required/recommendation
This paper is for information, discussion and approval to publish on the government’s pay gap 
reporting service by 30 March 2018.

1. Gender Pay Gap: introduction and legislative requirements 

1 

 
The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 requires all 
public sector organisations with 250 or more employees to calculate and publish details of 
their  gender  pay  gap  (GPG).  This  must  be  published  on  the  Trust’s  website  and  the 
Government Equality Office website by 30th March 2018. The Trust must maintain 3 years of 
data on a rolling basis thereafter.  

Paper 7 

The GPG is calculated comparing the average hourly pay of all men in an organisation in 
comparison to the average pay of all women in the same organisation.  

The  objective  of  GPG  reporting  is  to  identify  if  there  is  disparity  in  earnings,  bonuses, 
overtime etc and the reasons for these.  

The GPG pay is not equal pay. Equal pay relates to paying male and female employees in 
the  same  or  similar  jobs  the  same  pay  rate  for  work  of  equal  value.  The  GPG  may  be 
influenced by other elements such as the ability to undertake work in overtime or premium 
time  periods,  the  distribution  of  bonus  payments,  time  taken  out  of  employment  etc.  The 
GPG reflects the overall differences in pay received by men and women. 
a. To comply with the gender pay regulations the Trust must: 

•  Publish its GPG data and a written statement on its public facing website; 
•  Report its GPG data on the government’s online gender pay reporting service.  
•  The figures must be calculated using a specific reference date called a “snap shot 
date”. The first snapshot date is 31st March 2017 and 31st  March yearly thereafter. 
The data must be published within one year of the snap shot date ie by 30th March 
the following year. 

b. The gender pay data must contain the following: 

•  Mean GPG in hourly pay 
•  Median GPG in hourly pay  
•  Mean bonus GPG  
•  Median bonus GPG  
•  Proportion of males and females receiving bonus payment 
•  Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile. 

2. National overview 
The  Office  of  National  Statistics  (ONS)  publication  on  17th  January  2018  noted  that  the 
majority  of  the GPG  in  the  UK  cannot  be  explained  just  by  differences between  men  and 
women and the types of jobs they do. There are many underlying factors that may cause 
differences including: average length of service, career breaks, family structures, education, 
childcare commitments and ability to work (eg in premium hours or overtime). The purpose 
of  GPG  reporting  is  to  better  understand  the  reasons  for  differentials  and  to  establish 
barriers to reducing the GPG. National data suggests the following GPGs:  

•  Median Public Sector gap – 13.1%  
•  Median Private Sector gap – 15.9%  

3. Overall gender pay gap in hourly rate  

The Royal Free London’s GPG data shows female employees earn a mean hourly average 
pay of 17.68% less than men. The median difference is 13.32%, see Table 1 below. This 
data is inclusive of all staff groups.  

Table 1: The overall GPG based on the basic hourly rate for all employees is as follows:

Mean hourly rate

Further  analysis  highlights  variation  in  the  rate  of  GPG  within  staff  groups.  The 
administrative and clerical (13.85%) and the medical and dental staff group (17.38%) have a 
higher differential than the Allied Health Professions groups eg Pharmacists, Psychologists 
etc (-2.52%) and Additional Clinical Services (Healthcare support workers) (-1.79%) where 
the GPG is in favour of women. 
4. GPG for bonus payments  

All employees are paid under Agenda for Change (AfC) term and Conditions except medical 
and  dental  staff groups and  some  senior  and  very  senior  managers. The  only  staff group 
paid bonus payments are consultant medical staff, who receive Clinical Excellence Awards 
and Distinction Awards/Discretionary points. Table 2 below highlights a 22.13% mean pay 
gap overall for bonus payment.

5. Proportion of male and female employees receiving bonus payments 

5.91%  of  male  employees  in  the  Trust  receive  bonus  payment  compared  to  1.16%  of  all 
female  employees  -  and  these  are  solely  medical  staff  (Table  3a).  The  CEA  awards  are 
determined locally in the Trust while national awards are determined nationally and funded 
by Department of Health. Table 3b below highlights the Trust has a higher proportion of men 
in  its  Consultant  grade  and  that  men  receive  a  higher  proportion  of  the  CEA  and 
discretionary point bonus payments.

7. Future action  

The  Trust  is  committed  to  eliminating  discrimination  between  men  and  women  based  on 
gender but also discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, nationality, 
age, disability etc. The GPG provides a useful analysis of differences in pay but the reasons 
for  these  need  to  be  further  explored.  Steps  that  may  help  reduce  the  GPG,  and  any 
differentials  in  pay  identified  between  groups  with  other  ‘protected  characteristics’  will 
include: 

•  Promoting  opportunities  for  career  progression  and  ensuring  fairness  in  processes 

and procedures 

other groups 

plans. 

•  Best recruitment practices to attract applicants from all backgrounds 
•  Creating opportunities for all employees to progress 
•  Challenge systems and mind-sets to ensure that they do not disadvantage women or 

•  Appropriate senior role models 
•  Promoting flexible working and staff support 
•  Review of the CEA process 
•  Gender  equality  to  continue  to  form  an  integral  part  of  the  Trust’s  equality  action 

It is proposed that a gender pay gap working group is established to develop further GPG 
analysis and recommend actions. 
8. Recommendations

•  The Trust Board and the Quality, Improvement and Leadership Committee are asked 
to  approve  the  reporting  requirements  for  Gender  Pay  Reporting  and  Trust 
supporting statement in appendix A and B to be published by 30th March 2018. 

•  Note further actions to be taken by the Trust to address gaps identified.

Appendix B - Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust 

Gender Pay Gap Supporting Statement  

The Trust is committed to supporting an equitable and fair pay and reward system that 
recognises the contribution of all staff irrespective of gender. We will take steps through best 
recruitment practices to attract applicants from all backgrounds, create opportunities for all 
employees to progress once in employment, challenge systems, processes and mindsets to 
ensure that they do not disadvantage women or any other group. 

As an NHS trust, Agenda for Change national pay system is in place for all staff except 
medical and dental staff occupational groups. Where gender pay gap is identified, we will do 
further analytical work to better understand the data and engage all stakeholders in the 
organisation as we move forward to address gender equality. 

The Trust’s bonus payment is solely paid to medical staff and constitutes of both national 
and local elements paid from Clinical Excellence Awards (CEA) and Distinction Awards 
(DA). Over the years, the length of service of male consultants has led to gender pay gap in 
this staff group and will require more female consultants applying for these awards in the 
future to make a shift. Further work will be undertaken locally to raise and promote 
awareness of the CEA and DA processes to engage more female consultants in addressing 
these areas of gender imbalance. 

Future action 

The Trust will ensure that gender equality is an integral part of its equality, diversity and 
inclusion action plan.  

We will review our local CEA processes to ensure we focus on how to attract more female 
consultants to apply for CEA and DAs. In addition, we will continue to roll Unconscious bias 
training to staff and managers in the Trust to enhance best practice in our employment 
practices.

Finance Report for February 2018 (M11)

Executive Summary
At end of M11, the trust reported a year to date deficit of £18.5m which is £49.3m favourable 
compared to plan. Better than planned performance at the end of M11 is due to early receipt of 
profit from sales (£46.2m) and impact of recovery actions.  

Overall,  pay  costs  remain  flat  at  around  £44m.    Whilst  the  group  has  made  significant 
improvements  in  variable  spend,  we  still  have  a  sizeable  agency  bill,  spending  £1.3m  in 
February on agency staff.  We have seen a switch to bank, where monthly spend is regularly in 
excess of £4.5m.  Non pay monthly spend is more variable, although February was marginally 
lower than the previous quarter.   

Excluding  profit  from  Parcel  B,  the  year  to  date  favourable  variance  is    £3.1m.  Factors  
contributing to variance from plan are outlined in the report. 

The cash balance on the 28th February was £50.2m.

Forecast outturn and 
emerging risks  

1  At end of M11, the Trust reported a year to date deficit of £18.5m which is £49.3m favourable compared to plan. Better than 

planned performance at end of M11 is due to early receipt of profit from sales (£46.2m) and impact of recovery actions.  
 
Overall, pay costs remain flat at around £44m.  Whilst the Group has made significant improvements in variable spend, we still 
have a sizeable agency bill, spending £1.3m in February on agency staff.  We have seen a switch to bank, where monthly spend is 
regularly in excess of £4.5m. 
 
Non pay monthly spend is more variable, although February was marginally lower than the previous quarter.   
 
Excluding profit from Parcel B, the year to date favourable variance is  £3.1m. Factors  contributing to variance from plan are 
 
• Underperformance in elective and day case 
• Under recovery in private patient income of £3m 
•
 

Impact of non-recurrent recovery actions 

2  Although the Trust is forecasting to deliver and potentially exceed the plan for FY18, there are some significant risks included in 

Slippage on PPU contribution 

Slippage in FIP & recovery actions at group and site level identified 

this forecast. Some of the key risks that are being managed include: 
• CQUIN risk reserve  
•
• Chase Farm transition costs 
•
 
FY18 plan includes delivery of £44.7m FIP. At end of M11, the Trust delivered £30.6m of FIP. The Trust is currently forecasting to 
deliver £44.2m of FIP including recovery actions.  Clearly there is a significant level of non-recurrent improvement in this position 
which remains a concern.

–  Delivered £30.6m 
YTD   

3 

Cash position –  
£50.2m at end of 
February 

4  The cash balance on the 28th February  was £50.2m. 

   

This continues to be high due to the Parcel B land sale receipts of £47.5m received in December and a further working capital 
loan of £10m in January. Whilst the cash flow is now looking relatively healthy the Trust is advised that the majority of the land 
sales will be used to fund the redevelopment of Chase Farm and therefore a further draw down of £20m in March has been 
requested. The year-end cash balance forecast is currently expected to be £32.5m. 

Debt continues to be targeted and older debt reduces as work continues to clear historic debt from CCGs and NHSE.  

The Trust is continuing to manage its cash position in the best interests of both patients and creditors.

M11 (Feb) Performance FY18 

Key Clinical Income Variance Drivers 
 
•

Elective inpatients continue to underperform, predominantly due to day case 
underperformance across all sites 
 

• Non-Electives inpatients continues to overperform, predominantly at Barnet site, of 

which an element is due to CCG QIPP non-delivery 
 

• Outpatients were slightly above plan,  and still slightly behind plan YTD 

 

• Other notable movements in month: Oncology continues to over-perform, continued 

overperformance (vs zero plan) in Rehab on Capetown 
 

 
 
Key Contract Performance Highlights: 

 

 

 

 
 

Herts – underperformance in Day case, Outpatients and Direct Access, with overperformance in Critical Care, Maternity, Non-Electives, and PTS  

NCL – u/perf in Day case,  Non-Elective, with o/perf in A&E, Elective inpatients, Outpatients and Rehab. Non-delivery of back-ended QIPP plans making a significant 

impact on the Marginal Rate, which is now at £9.6m.   

NHSE Spec Comm – u/perf in Elective inpatients, Non-Elective inpatients, o/perf in Adult Critical Care , Programmes, Chemotherapy, and Day case 

NHSE Other – u/perf driven predominantly by Dental Day case, Elective Inpatients and Outpatients, with o/perf in breast screening

The cash plan below shows the long terms cash flow to 31st March 2018. This is heavily reliant on loans from DH and managing the working capital 

position tightly. 

Key Messages 
• Opening cash position as per accounts was £18m i.e. just above the 

suggested buffer,  

• Working capital loans of £20m in March 
•

A&E – 
Feb 
2018 

• Performance in January was 
reported at 84.3%, although 
further validation may increase 
this 
Initial evaluation of new LGI 
pathway at Barnet Hospital has 
suggested it should improve the 
pathway for patients 

•

• Prostate cancer diagnostic team 

has been shortlisted for BMJ 
award 

• Un-validated February 

performance is currently at 
78.8%, renal backlog clearance 
driving breach volumes   

• Backlog is currently stable 
around 70 to 75 patients, a 
positive sign for March (72 
patients as at 16/03/2018) 
 

• High Breast referrals have 
continued helping to drive 
overall trust PTL above target, 
creating risk for April 
performance onwards 

• Performance has deteriorated to 

• Trajectory still plans recovery in 

83.0% in January 2018 

• 34 over 52 week waiters 
• Problems with the data 

warehouse this month reduced 
available validation time, this is 
believed a primary driver for 
performance deterioration 

August 2018 due to scale of work 
required.  This is subject to 
negotiation on commissioner 
activity levels. 
 
 

• Barnet – performance is below 

• March still challenged with high 

trajectory but consistently better 
than this time last year  

• RFH – performance is below 
trajectory and same time last 
year, though further improvement 
on December and January  

attendances and ambulance 
conveyances  

• Mitigations taking place with 

focus on patient flow 
improvement and reduction in 
elective activity at both sites 

• Unexpected referral increases 
• Additional resources required to 

model demand & capacity 
across all hospital resource 
groups 

• Data warehouse failures 
resulting in no access to 
information 

• Performance problems at other 
trusts, leading to redirections of 
ambulance and walk-in activity, 
particularly Northwick park 

• High volatility in activity 
•

Increases in DTOC at Barnet  

• Evidence suggests improvement 
work is starting to have an impact

CHAIRMAN’S AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT

TRUST DEVELOPMENTS 

CHASE FARM HOSPITAL REDEVELOPMENT UPDATE 

The redevelopment of Chase Farm Hospital remains on time and on budget, with the new 
hospital set to be fully open in September 2018 with associated road and landscaping to be 
completed in 2019. The building works are concentrated on completing the interiors of the 
building in readiness for the first service moves in July 2018. The trust has submitted a 
planning application for the revised surface car parking proposal to the London Borough of 
Enfield in February. Surveys have indicated that the planned number of spaces will be 
sufficient for staff and patients. 

The focus of the programme remains on preparing teams to work in the new hospital, 
through re-designing their operational policies and workforce models, developing new 
information management and technology (IM&T) systems and planning the moves. 
Significant clinical engagement is underway to sign off the design of the new IM&T systems 
and ensure a smooth transition to the new systems. This work will realise efficiencies, 
making a major contribution to the trust’s financial strategy. Revised clinic and theatre 
schedules are being signed off which will change the hours some staff work, including 
working weekday evenings. Staff consultations have begun to agree the best shift patterns 
for the majority of staff, and effect the changes required to move into the new hospital. 

ROYAL FREE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT REDEVELOPMENT UPDATE

The Royal Free Emergency Department redevelopment is being undertaken under two 
contracts.  The first has been completed, which provided a new dedicated paediatric 
emergency department and waiting area, new staff facilities and office accommodation and a 
new ambulatory care unit. 

Contract 2 started on 26 September 2016 and comprises three phases.   The first phase of 
the construction works has delivered Part 1 of majors, a new reception desk, and the rapid 
assessment and treatment area including new London Ambulance Service handover 
facilities.   Phase 2 which provides a new imaging facility (including two x-ray rooms and one 
CT suite) and a six bedded resuscitation unit was completed in November 2017.  Work is 
now progressing on the final phase which completes the majors’ facility and delivers a new 
30 bedded clinical decision unit (CDU) which will go live in mid May 2018. The project is 
making excellent progress and the clinical and project teams are working closely to maintain 
clinical operations at all times. 

THE PEARS BUILDING 

The Pears Building is a new medical research centre which will be built on the grounds of 
the Royal Free Hospital.  The UCL Institute of Immunity and Transplantation (IIT) is a world-
class research facility which will move from the main hospital building into the Pears Building 
when it is completed. 

X:\ Chair and CEO report 21 March 2018

Paper 10 

This project is collaboration between the Royal Free London, the Royal Free Charity and 
University College London. Many local residents and organisations have supported the 
project. Among these has been the Pears Foundation, which donated £5million to the 
project. An award has also been received from the UK Research Partnership Investment 
Fund. 

The first stage of construction works for the Pears Building started on 12 March. The closure 
of the link road between Rowland Hill Street and Pond Street has allowed the pruning and 
removal of trees to progress in readiness for the main works to begin. 

A review of access and car parking management is due to be undertaken along with 
consideration of contractor deliveries. Changes and options will be discussed at the next 
construction working group meeting between the contractor (Willmott Dixon) and the local 
community on 27 March 2018. 

Over the next six to eight weeks the contractor, Willmott Dixon, will complete a number of 
tasks to set up the building site. This includes the erection of secure hoardings, installation of 
an office, changing and catering facilities for the building team, and preparing to commence 
the ground works for the new building.  

As part of the legal agreement (section 106 Agreement) between the Royal Free Charity and 
Camden Council a monitoring action plan has been established, with monitoring devices 
installed within and around the site, continuously monitoring the noise, dust, vibration, below 
ground water levels and below ground movement.  Should the monitoring devices record 
anything beyond agreed threshold levels action will be taken to ensure any harm is 
prevented. 

A construction working group has been formed consisting of the Pears Building project team 
and local residents, with a series of meetings arranged to address any specific concerns of 
the local community. This follows on from the public consultation/public exhibitions held 
some months ago.

take place.  Voting closes at 5pm on Thursday, 29 March 2018 and results will be 
announced on March 30. 

ASSOCIATE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 

NHS Improvement (NHSI) has designed the NExT Director scheme to help find and support 
the next generation of talented people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) 
communities to become non-executive directors in the NHS. The aim of the scheme is to 
help people from these groups with the senior skills and expertise necessary to make a real 
contribution to NHS to take that final step into the board room. The scheme, which has been 
likened to a board apprenticeship, was successfully piloted last year by eight NHS Trusts in 
London focusing on people from BAME communities. 

The board will wish to welcome Vineeta Manchanda who is joining the trust as an associate 
non-executive director as part of this programme. Vineeta will be a member of the population 
health and pathways committee.  She will be with the RFL on a placement for 12 months to 
get to know about the NED role, the board, council of governors and how the group operates 
and manages.  Vineeta is currently a lay member and audit chair at Waltham Forest clinical 
commissioning group.

LOCAL NEWS AND DEVELOPMENTS 

PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL 

Enfield Healthwatch has been in touch with the trust with some questions about the 
partnership and it was timely to provide a progress update.  The board  although the board 
rec.  The questions and responses are provided below. 

1)  We are requesting an update to be issued in a public domain on the discussions, 
including what are the options currently being considered for a potential future 
partnership between North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust and Royal Free 
London NHS Foundation Trust?  

The trust board of North Middlesex University Hospital (NMUH) made the decision in March 
2016 to explore becoming a full member of the Royal Free London (RFL) group.  It has been 
continuing those discussions since then.  It reaffirmed its commitment to that principle in 
August 2017 and agreed to become the first clinical partner of the RFL group.  This was 
reported to the Royal Free board at its September 2017 meeting and the chairman provided 
a verbal update at the January 2018 meeting.

Paper 10 

(2)  We are requesting an outline of the process and associated timescales for any 
options being considered for a potential future partnership between North Middlesex 
University Hospital NHS Trust and Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust? Could 
this information be made publicly available on the Trust’s website and communicated 
to the wider communities of Enfield and be regularly reported (with the necessary 
papers) to the public board meetings of the Trust to enable public scrutiny?  

A joint steering committee between RFL and NMUH met for the first time in February 2018. 
This committee is made up of the chairs and CEOs of both organisations, and also includes 
the regional director (London) from NHS Improvement and the accountable officer for the 
five CCGs in North Central London. 

This committee will oversee the development and progress of the partnership arrangements 
between the two organisations.   

RFL and NMUH will communicate key decisions and updates, as appropriate, from this 
meeting at their public board meetings.  

(3)  We are requesting details about how stakeholders, including local communities, 
will be consulted and involved in the decisions about any potential future partnership 
between North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust and Royal Free London NHS 
Foundation Trust?  

NMUH hosted a session in March 2018 for key stakeholders, to begin discussion around 
how best to inform, involve, engage and work with local communities and their 
representatives, on any potential partnership and other development activities for NMUH. 

RFL will continue to engage key stakeholders in discussions about its strategic development, 
including partnerships with other organisations. The RFL council of governors has been 
involved in discussions to date regarding the NMUH partnership and will be consulted about 
any future decisions that would involve significant changes of governance with another 
organisation. 

SECRETARY OF STATE VISIT TO THE ROYAL FREE HOSPITAL 

The trust welcomed the Rt. Hon. Jeremy Hunt, secretary of state for health and social care, 
to the Royal Free Hospital on 2 March. 

The secretary of state heard from Dominic Dodd, Royal Free London group chairman, about 
the trust’s vision for the group; Dr John Connolly, director for clinical pathways, who spoke 
about how clinical practice groups will deliver improved outcomes for patients and reduce 
unwarranted variation; and Deborah Sanders, group chief nurse, who spoke about the trust’s 
approach to patient safety. 

Royal Free Hospital staff were invited to the visit and the secretary of state spoke to a 
packed lecture theatre – including staff from all areas of the hospital – about the Department 
of Health and Social Care’s focus on reducing unnecessary harm in our hospitals. He took 
questions and thanked staff for all of their hard work – particularly their efforts during the 
recent bad weather.

BARNET HOSPITAL STROKE UNIT 

Barnet stroke unit has been awarded an A, the highest grade possible, in the recent stroke 
national audit which covered the period between August and November 2017.  The Sentinel 
Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) is the single source of stroke data in England, 
Wales and Northern Ireland. The audit is carried out three times a year. 

Factors influencing the audit result are the work of therapists, early identification of stroke 
patients in emergency areas, and strict adherence to the London Stroke pathway. 
Adherence involves sending patients with acute stroke to the hyper-acute stroke unit (HASU) 
at University College Hospital first, before being ‘repatriated’ back to the Barnet acute stroke 
unit for ongoing care.   

Barnet Hospital is part of the pan-London stroke network, which includes eight HASUs 
where immediate care is given to stroke patients by expert specialist staff. Patients are then 
transferred to their local acute stroke unit (ASU), such as Barnet Hospital, for ongoing acute 
management and rehabilitation. 

FRIENDS AND FAMILY TEST (FFT) UPDATE 

The NHS friends and family test (FFT) was introduced in 2013 to enable patients to feed 
back on their care and treatment to enable hospitals and other providers to improve 
services.  

It asks patients whether they would recommend hospital wards, A&E departments, maternity 
services and out-patient clinics to their friends and family if they needed similar care or 
treatment. The February results are below.

Internal communications 
By the end of the flu campaign, 72% of frontline staff had been vaccinated. We continue to 
celebrate the achievements of our flu fighting teams. 
February saw the relaunch of the Go-See programme which creates opportunities for non-
executive directors (NEDS) to pair up with governors to visit all areas across our hospitals to 
hear about what’s working, what could be improved and what staff would like to change. 
The communications team supported the roll out of the financial improvement plan (FIP) 
week, by encouraging staff to think about the ways that they can reduce waste and improve 
efficiency. We created a call to action banner which linked to articles on Freenet, followed by 
an all-staff email from the group chief executive and chief finance officer. By the end of the 
week the trust had identified savings of nearly £27million for the 2018/19 financial year.

NATIONAL NEWS AND DEVELOPMENTS 

NHS ENGLAND BOARD MEETING– 8 FEBRUARY 2018 

The main items discussed are summarised below. 

Planning guidance and financial allocations for 2018/19 

•  The planning guidance has been framed in terms of : the improved funding outlook, 

the already agreed 2018/19 ‘deliverables’ set out in the Next Steps document, the 
priorities set by Government in the November budget and the expected mandate, 
insight from public engagement as well as the five “considerations to guide decision” 
detailed at the last board meeting in November. 

•  The board confirmed that the extra money now provides funding growth of 2.4% in 

real terms compared to 2017/18. Factoring in England’s growing and ageing 
population, age-weighted revenue growth per person becomes 1.4% in 2018/19. 

•  CCG running cost allocations have not changed and the £600m core allocations will 

be distributed to all CCGs in proportion to a CCG’s overall fair share of funding 
according to the target allocation formula. A higher level of funding will be allocated 
to specialised services as the latest assessment has concluded there will be higher 
than expected costs.

Lessons learned review of the WannaCry Ransomware Cyber attack 

•  The review draws on the NHS’s internal assessments as well as the two national 
reviews that have been assessed: the NAO as well as the National Cyber Security 
2017 Annual Review. 

•  The report accepts the next cyber attack is a question of “when” not “if”. 

Consequently there are 22 recommendations the review team would like NHS 
England to take forward. Beyond this, there has been a “reprioritisation” of funds, 
primarily away from the paperless agenda work and to cyber security infrastructure. 
However it should be noted that not all of these funding announcements are new. 

Financial report paper (month nine) 

CCGs have reported a year to date overspend of £471m, with 95 CCGs report adverse 
variance from their plans. A year of position of £351m is currently being forecast, however 
given the likely system risks that may occur over the next few months, the paper reports an 
underlying position of a £400m-£500m deficit. This is despite a £519m increase in the in-
year delivery of efficiencies. 

•  CQC decided to reschedule some routine inspections of NHS acute services, GP 
practices and urgent care services planned for January. This was in response to 
increased pressure on the health and social care system as services coped with 
additional demand driven in part by a rise in respiratory illness and flu.  Inspections 
scheduled in response to concerns about quality or safety will go ahead as planned, 
including those that are in response to new information and those following up on 
previously identified concerns.  A normal inspection schedule is expected to resume in 
February but this will be subject to review. 

• 

•  The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) published the outcome to its 

consultation into broadening CQC powers to rate independent healthcare providers on 3 
January 2018. 
It confirms that its proposals have been accepted and that the type of healthcare 
services for which CQC awards ratings has been extended to a final group of more than 
800 additional providers, including independent GPs and digital doctors, sexual health 
services and termination of pregnancy services.  CQC is now developing an approach 
for how it rates these additional services and will launch a public consultation on this 
topic at the end of January. 

•  CQC has published a consultation on its proposals for regulating independent healthcare 

(care that is provided by organisations that are not NHS trusts or GP services) in the 
next phase of inspections.  CQC plans to publish its consultation response and begin to 
rate those types of services in June 2018.

HEALTH EDUCATION ENGLAND (HEE) BOARD MEETING – 20 
FEBRUARY 2018 

Below is a summary of what was discussed at the HEE board meeting on 20 February 
2018: 

Chief Executive’s update 

•  Final decision expected next month on allocating the additional 1,000 

undergraduate medical education places. The expansion will be targeted at 
widening participation in medicine and at boosting recruitment in specific 
geographies and specialties that have traditionally found it hard to recruit. 

•  HEE is working with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in 

drafting a response to the Health Select Committee’s report into the nursing 
workforce. 

•  Alongside Public Health England and NHSI, HEE is leading a health and care 

consortium to support the design of the Cross-Government Prosperity Fund 
‘Better Health’ Programme, led by the FCO. The programme represents £80m 
of ODA spending over the current Parliament, including £18m on education and 
training.  

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Committee 

•  EDI strategy is expected to be published in March/April.  The widening 

participation work falls into three areas: access to education and employment, 
access to professions, and consideration of EDI.  EDI national and regional 
dashboards are still in development. 

Workforce strategy: associated products 

HEE is looking to publish a number of data factsheets that were dropped from the 
Facing the Facts, Shaping the Future strategy document. This data will focus on 
growth in posts, people, and vacancies, as well as outlining the component drivers of 
supply through use of ‘waterfall’ diagrams.  The series will be updated periodically and 
the frequency of publication will be determined by the specific pattern of workforce 
‘events’ relevant to each staff group.  The first of these factsheets is on registered 
midwives 

CARE QUALITY COMMISSION BOARD MEETING – 21 FEBRUARY 2018 
.
Chief Executive’s report – February 2018 

•  CQC has welcomed and accepted all the recommendations that relate to 
CQC  in  the  Kirkup  review  into  Liverpool  Community  Health  NHS  Trust, 
including reviewing the fit and proper persons test (FPPR). 

X:\ Chair and CEO report 21 March 2018

Paper 10 

•  CQC is working with the Department of Health and Social Care to explore 
the scope of the review. It will address the operation and purpose of the 
FPPR,  including  but  not  limited  to  where  an  individual  moves  from  one 
NHS role to another, and the effectiveness of investigations into concerns 
raised. 

Quarter 3 performance report 

Inspections  undertaken  against  CQC’s  published  commitments  are  on  track  in 
hospitals.  For the full year, CQC’s forecast outturn indicates a potential £10.2m 
underspend.  At the beginning of January, in response to increased pressure on 
the health and care system over winter, CQC paused some routine inspections of 
urgent care services. CQC monitored NHS acute services but went ahead with all 
planned. 

Healthwatch England update 

Healthwatch  England  has  written  to  the  Secretary  of  State  about  its  worrying 
funding  situation  (it  now  receives  the  same  level  of  funding  as  its  predecessor 
LINks, but has significantly increased duties). 

Over the last six months local authorities have been more successful in reducing 
the  number  of  delayed  transfers  of  care  than  the  NHS.  Healthwatch  England 
welcomed this progress, but highlights in a report published in October that this 
has yet to make a significant impact on people’s experiences of moving between 
services.  This  work  raised  questions  about  the  risks  of  focusing  solely  on 
reducing delayed discharges as it is also vital to ensure that they get home safely 
and with the right support in place.

Report from the quality improvement and leadership committee (QILC) held 22 
January 2018

Executive summary 
Group goals and group board assurance framework – QI&LC aligned goals 
The chair noted that the goals and risks aligned to the committee had been accepted and 
highlighted that further changes recommended by the committee following the meeting would 
need to go through a formal process of approval by the trust board.  The committee reviewed 
its allocated risks on the group board assurance framework alongside the relevant agenda 
item, particularly in terms of the risk scoring and timescales and actions, with the 
recommendations arising from those discussions having been fed back to the board at its 
meeting in January. 

Workforce race equality standards (WRES) – reducing the likelihood of black and 
ethnic minority (BME) staff entering formal disciplinary process to 1.0 
The committee received a presentation focussing on the trust’s aim to reduce the likelihood 
of BME staff entering formal disciplinary within transplant and specialist services (TaSS) to a 
ratio of 1.10. Trust data had identified TaSS as the division with the highest number of of 
BME staff entering the formal disciplinary process and it was decided that the team would 
apply the Quality Improvement principles to this programme of work, alongside holding a 
number of fact finding sessions with investigation managers, chairs of hearings and 
employees.  Discussions were had on the data, including ensuring disciplinary data was 
available more regularly and shared with managers so there was greater visibility around 
cases; learning and ensuring this was shared across and staff and management groups; the 
need for greater cultural awareness; ensuring difficult conversations were had earlier on in 
proceedings; and investigating facts and leaving assumptions of guilt behind.   In closing, the 
chair noted that lots of work had been done thus far and more was in chain to improve the 
position further.  She considered that this was an area of importance in terms of the trust’s 
values and, therefore, the data should be spread across the group to enable greater 
awareness and future learning. 

Framework for CQC regulatory compliance assurance 
The committee received a paper outlining how the committee would take assurance that its 
goal, ‘’all sites self-assessed as CQC outstanding’’ would be achieved.  It noted that this was 
aligned with the CQC quarterly self-assessments undertaken by services across the trust 
and the CQC’s new inspection approach which was to carry out well led inspections, 
preceded by an unannounced inspection of certain core services.  In preparation for the 
inspection, arrangements were underway for the trust to undertake the NHS Improvement 
well-led review, the guidance on which was written to dovetail with the CQC’s regulatory 
assessment of well-led including key lines of enquiry.  Alongside that, the trust also wished to 
have a peer review process.  The committee considered it would be helpful to look at other 
trust’s that had been rated as outstanding by the CQC and the evidence behind that so that 
the trust could have greater confidence in its self-assessment scores, especially where staff 

FINAL 9/3/18 

Page 1 of 4 

Paper 11
had rated these as outstanding.  In closing, the committee felt that the CQC self-assessment 
process was robust but might need to be accelerated in view of the impending well-led 
review. 

Patient and family experience partners update, improving patient experience, patient 
experience collaborative  
The committee noted that there had been little movement since the last meeting, particularly 
in recruiting patients as partners.   The chair considered the progress on this was moving too 
slowly and asked what the committee could do to improve this and ensure a good quality 
report was provided at future meetings.  In addition, she suggested it would be helpful to 
have information on who was involved in patient engagement / involvement currently and 
where were the gaps.  The committee considered this work was a top priority. 

Workforce  
The committee received its first report in the new style of reporting which it found very helpful 
but considered it could benefit from the inclusion of targets by year as this would provide a 
clear visual for managing progress and slippage.  Updates were given in respect of each of 
the committee’s goals around efficiency and staff satisfaction, including staff retention where 
it was noted that the staff experience and retention plan would be extended to focus on 
learning from the implementation of the NHS Improvement retention toolkit in ICU Barnet 
Hospital.  The committee appreciated that the trust needed to be better on doing exit 
interviews but this was challenging given that staff were not mandated to undertake these 
and, therefore, increasing uptake would be challenging.    

Workforce race equality standards (WRES) general update   
The committee received an update on progress against each of the WRES indicators as 
reported in the workforce section of the annual equality monitoring report.   

Workforce disability equality standards (WDES) 
The committee noted that a large number of members of staff had reported themselves as 
having a disability in the 2016 staff survey but the numbers actually reported on ESR were 
significantly lower so it was clear that this was a disclosure issue and work was needed to 
ensure staff felt comfortable in declaring that information.  The chair noted that disability 
equality data would be a major focus for the year with a similar approach to the WRES and 
suggested it would be helpful for the committee to receive a paper at its March meeting 
stating the areas the team could start working on in advance of the data coming through.  

Annual equality monitoring report 2017 
Subject to follow up on the chair’s comments, the committee approved the annual equality 
information monitoring report on behalf of the board for publication on the trust’s website by 
the end of March 2018. 

QI programme – implementation update and summary of Institute of Healthcare 
Improvement annual strategic visit 
The committee noted the aim of ensuring quality improvement (QI) work became business as 
usual across the trust both clinically and non-clinically.  There was now a greater recognition 
of what QI was and how its methodology could help in the trust’s day to day work.  However, 
effort was needed in maintaining momentum and supporting frontline delivery.  The 
committee discussed the resource needed to see this through, whilst ensuring there was 
greater ownership at a local level.   

Leadership and talent update 
The committee recognised that further work was needed on identifying business critical roles 
and the chair suggested that this be addressed at the group awayday in February where site 
colleagues would be in attendance, with an updated paper taken to the committee thereafter.   
The committee considered that a key aspect of the ‘group’ was to create opportunities for 

FINAL 9/3/18 

Page 2 of 4 

Paper 11

leaders. 

Cancer experience  
The committee noted that discussions were underway with the informatics team on improving 
the collation of data in relation to the completion of treatment summaries. 

Dementia  
The committee noted that improvement plans were in place following the findings from the 
dementia audit reported at its previous meeting.  It noted that the dementia implementation 
group would now meet monthly, on both the Barnet and Royal Free hospital sites; a finger 
food menu had been launched on ward 10N, Royal Free Hospital; and the dementia care 
plan was being tested with patients and carers in February.  The chair was pleased to note 
that there were 600 CAPER Anchors that had been trained in less than a year across all 
clinical sites.  The committee noted that the trust would be re-audited in Spring 2018 and it 
was suggested that the board be updated on the progress of the dementia programme of 
work and that this should be scheduled in line with the dementia audit timetable. 

PALS and complaints report – Q3 2017-18 
The chair asked that the next report show the action taken in respect of the two complaints 
citing discrimination.  She was pleased to note that action had been taken to address the 
responses outstanding in respect of complaints at Barnet Hospital, with the number of cases 
having been reduced by half already and the expectation that all outstanding ones  would be 
completed within the next 2-3 months. 

Action required
The trust board is asked to note the report.

Report from the clinical standards and innovation committee held 19 February 2018 

Executive summary 
The clinical standards and innovation committee (CSIC) met on 19 February 2018.  The key 
issues discussed and actions agreed are outlined below. 

Clinical practice groups – digital pathways  
The committee received an update on the clinical practice groups digital (CPG) pathways, 
with specific focus on the seven pathways prioritised for digitisation by the time of the roll out 
of Cerner Millennium Model Content and the opening of the new Chase Farm Hospital.  The 
committee noted the governance processes, including the 8-step process for digitisation; that 
each digitised pathway would be subject to an agreed timeline; and that the pathways had 
been co-designed with staff and patients.   

The committee’s discussion focussed on the timelines for the digitised pathways and whether 
there were any risks to delivery; clinical engagement which it considered would be key to the 
success of digital pathways implementation, including the time pressures on those members 
of staff and ensuring momentum was maintained; the financial expectations; and patient and 
staff involvement.   

In terms of actions, the Chair asked the group director of CPGs to consider what, if any, 
assistance the CSIC could offer in order to help encourage staff to engage fully in the 
implementation of the pathways whilst ensuring the capacity was available to do that.  It 
noted that a paper on the financial elements would go to the group executive committee in 
due course and to the CSIC thereafter.  Furthermore, the committee would receive 
presentations on all of the agreed pathways as they came to maturity. 

Never events and safer surgery improvement  
The committee received a presentation on a review of the trust’s never events 2017-18 which
