Spencer Group Gender Pay Gap Report 

We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.

This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings 
of men and women in our organisation; it does not involve publishing individual employee’s data.

These calculations include;

• Mean gender pay gap

• Median gender pay gap

• Mean bonus gender pay gap

• Median bonus gender pay gap

• Proportion of males and females receiving bonus pay

• Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile

We can see from the results of our gender balance within the four quartiles that we still have 
work to do to improve the numbers of women holding senior roles within the business. 

Improving the gender diversity within Spencer Group is something which the business takes very 
seriously. The Engineering Industry has historically been very male dominated and this is reflect-
ed in the results of our current Gender Pay Gap reporting. 

As an accredited Living Wage Employer we are confident that men and women are paid equally 
for doing the same jobs, however we acknowledge that due to the issues in recruiting women 
into the industry in the past the majority of senior roles are held by men. 

We are playing our part in actively promoting the roles available to women within both the 
business and the industry as a whole and we look forward to seeing  this reflected in our 2017/18 
Gender Pay Gap reporting.

I can confirm that the figures reported are correct
