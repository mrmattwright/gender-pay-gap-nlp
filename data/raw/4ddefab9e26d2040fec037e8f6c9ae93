Hawkins\Brown has worked hard to build a reputation as a leading employer within our industry. We recognise that we can do more to promote gender equality, particularly where it comes to supporting long-term career progression. We have set out the steps we have already taken to achieve this in the report below. In addition we recently enlisted an independent expert to perform an audit of diversity and equality within our workplace culture.
