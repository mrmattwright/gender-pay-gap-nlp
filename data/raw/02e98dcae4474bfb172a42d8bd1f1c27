We are committed to having a responsible, diverse and inclusive workforce. We recognise that our sector is traditionally engineering-led and has been male dominated, something we want to help change.  As we publish our gender pay gap report, we are able to demonstrate where we are making some good progress, and also identify where we have further opportunities to improve and address key areas of imbalance.
