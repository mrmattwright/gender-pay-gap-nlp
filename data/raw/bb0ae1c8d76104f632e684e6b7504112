Pay bands are agreed using a clear scoring system to ensure that equal pay is received for equal work.  Of course, Cats Protection is always asking the question ‘Can we do better?’. The legal requirement to report on our gender pay gap as of 5 April 2017 has given us the opportunity to focus on that question with regard to pay and gender.  What our 2017 report shows  The results show that Cats Protection has a higher percentage of males in the upper quartile (and therefore in higher paid roles) than in the other three quartiles. This reflects trends in the UK economy as a whole and creates our gender pay gap.  Our bonus gap  Cats Protection pays an annual Christmas bonus of £100 net of tax. This means that each individual’s bonus is grossed up to ensure that they receive £100 in their pocket. Although this appears to be an equal reward, the fact that more males are in the higher earners bracket means that their bonuses will be grossed up further, thus creating the 3.8% gap.  Can we do better?  We know that our gender pay gap is not a pay issue but is due to the fact that males and females are not represented equally across our roles. For example, we have a high percentage of female cat care assistants, a role that is in a lower quartile and a high percentage of male IT specialists, roles that are in the upper quartiles. In common with UK trends we also have more men in leadership roles.  Our results are not necessarily surprising but we have every intention of working to improve them. We will:   continue to ensure that pay systems are transparent and based on objective criteria  continue to monitor and review the impact of our pay policies  promote our family-friendly policies to support parents and carers; embrace flexible working best practice and support remote working where possible  use our Leading the Way leadership programme to support the development of our people   Dominic Sullivan Acting CEO, Cats Protection             Reg Charity 203644 (England and Wales) and SC037711 (Scotland)  Contact Us  National Cat Centre, Chelwood Gate, Haywards Heath, Sussex, RH17 7TT      Helpful links    Adopt a cat Ready to adopt?
