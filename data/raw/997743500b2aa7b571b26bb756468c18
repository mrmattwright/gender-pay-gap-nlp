FOREWORD

As Group Human Resources 
Director at Gattaca I am 
passionate about making sure 
our employees and contracted 
staff are treated with dignity and 
respect throughout their whole 
experience with Gattaca. This 
means having fair processes in 
place for how we recruit people, 
how we onboard new starters 
and how they are treated whilst 
they work here, including the opportunities every individual 
has for career progression. Ultimately, I want all of the 
Gattaca workforce to be happy, healthy and love their jobs.

The management board shares the view that all of the people 
who work at Gattaca should be treated fairly and equally. As 
a business, we are keen to take proactive steps to close the 
gender pay gap that exists within our organisation and are 
striving towards a future with no gap.

This report sets out our 2017 figures, the things we already 
do to promote fairness, equality, diversity and inclusion in the 
workplace and the steps we will take to close the gap.

I confirm that our data has been calculated according to 
the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017.

A NOTE ON 
GENDER PAY GAP

A gender pay gap is a measure 
of the difference in the average 
pay of men and women - 
regardless of the nature of their 
work - across an organisation.

It is different from an equal 
pay comparison, which would 
involve comparing two or more 
people carrying out the same, 
similar or equivalent work.

Since 1970 it has been illegal to 
pay men and women differently 
for ‘like’ work. Gattaca’s 
structured salary bands along 
with performance related pay-
rises ensure we comply with the 
relevant laws on equal pay and 
equality.

TERMINOLOGY

MEAN - this is the value you get 
from dividing the sum of several 
quantities by their number. 

MEDIAN - this is the middle 
value within a range of values 
from lowest to highest.

KEY NOTES:

•  Each of the above quartiles contains 140 employees.

•  It groups various job roles across both the recruitment 

and Group Support sides of our business and 
demonstrates the much smaller gaps we have at these 
levels.

•  The figures in the upper quartile show proportionately 
fewer females in the highest earning bracket, indicating 
less gender diversity at leadership level. You’ll see in 
‘Picturing the future’ (page 9) that this is a priority area 
for us to address.

•  As the data is focused solely on our employees in 

the UK, it doesn’t take into account our international 
employees. We are proud to have a number of women 
in senior leadership roles globally.

We are committed to 
following best practice...
that’s why we have

Pledge championed by 
the Recruitment &

OUR APPROACH

When it comes to equality, diversity and inclusion, we are 
committed to following best practice, both in our internal 
recruitment and HR processes and in the recruitment 
services we provide to our clients. That’s why we have signed 
the Diversity Pledge championed by the Recruitment & 
Employment Confederation (REC) and Jobcentre Plus.

In signing the Diversity Pledge we agree to:

•  Value and harness the differences between people, and the 

benefits that can be gained from those differences

•  Actively seek to identify diverse candidate pools and 

promote their engagement

•  Review all aspects of the employment process to eradicate 

unjustifiable discrimination

•  Promote recruitment and selection best practice in 

accordance with REC agreed standards

•  Work with others to challenge discrimination where we 

find it.

There are a number of other steps we have taken to ensure 
we are maintaining best practice within the business. These 
include:

•  Training all staff on equality & diversity via an online 

learning platform 

•  Setting up diversity champions globally to keep diversity 

high on the agenda 

•  Building a better way to track diversity into our new HR 

system

•  Reporting our diversity at Board level on a quarterly basis

•  Increased the number of flexible working arrangements we 

have across the business (for both men and women)

•  Enhancing maternity leave; increasing statutory payments 

to better support our female workforce and encourage 
them back to work with a financial incentive. These 
enhancements were a direct result of what employees said 
was important in a staff engagement survey.

•  Created social forums for our employees on maternity 

leave, both online, through a dedicated Facebook page, 
and face-to-face; inviting employees on maternity leave 
to attend a baby sensory session and receive a business 
update.

•  Introducing a job share scheme. For several years, we have 

run a successful job share scheme which has enabled our 
employees greater flexibility in working hours whilst still 
having the opportunity to grow their career at Gattaca.

COLLABORATING WITH 
INDUSTRY

We have also looked for opportunities to promote best 
practice externally with our clients and in our industries. Here 
are some examples:

•  Created a Gattaca Lean In Circle: Lean In Circles are small 

groups of business professionals who meet regularly to 
learn and grow together. 

•  Supported initiatives to promote engineering and 

technology as career choices to women so they have equal 
opportunities in these male-dominated fields.

 » Our specialist engineering brand Matchtech has long-
supported the Women’s Engineering Society (WES), 
which has been the voice of female engineers since 
1919. Matchtech actively supports WES initiatives like 
International Women in Engineering Day.

 » Our specialist technology brand Networkers is a 

corporate partner of Girls in Tech, a non-profit which 
helps women advance their career in STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Maths) fields.

•  Supported initiatives to encourage young people into 

STEM careers, which often have a focus on getting girls 
interested in these typically male-dominated fields.

 » Our specialist engineering brand Matchtech is a 

corporate member of EngineeringUK; a not-for-profit 
organisation whose purpose is to promote the vital 
contribution that engineers make to our society.

 » Matchtech also supports STEMNet; the Science, 

Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network 
which creates opportunities to inspire young people 
into STEM subjects and careers.

Gattaca is such a 
supportive company; 
they’ve really helped me 
develop by investing in 
my training and 
personal development.

OUR PEOPLE

Here are a few stories from some female Gattaca employees 
of their experience working for the company.

JOSIE HUGHES
GLOBAL MARKETING DIRECTOR

I joined the company in 2004 as a 
Marketing Executive, in 2015 I took 
on the role of Head of Marketing 
and in 2017, I was promoted to 
Global Marketing Director. A lot 
has changed in the business in that 
time - we’ve grown from one brand 

at a single site in the South of England, to a house of 
global brands with a network of offices around the 
world.

I push myself to continually learn more about our 
markets and get closer to our customers and I know 
Gattaca will always support me.

By investing in my training, Gattaca has enabled 
me to obtain marketing qualifications, enhance my 
management and leadership skills and given me 
the benefit of working with a personal coach. Most 
recently, I have had the privilege of going to Stanford 
University in California to study Customer Focused 
Innovation, which shows how committed the business 
is to my development. The Group has also been 
incredibly supportive of my personal life; allowing 
flexible hours when having my son and supporting me 
while my husband was very ill and needed treatment. 

Everyone at Gattaca works hard but has a lot of fun 
together in the process. I love the fact the business 
is always evolving and changing – it makes my job 
very exciting and I can’t wait to see what we will 
look like in the next couple of years.

I have taken some 
time off from my 
career for 
maternity leave 
and now work 
part time, but 
very successfully.

“

”

“

Gattaca is mindful 
and respectful 
that employees 
have a life outside 
of work. As a 
mother of two 
small children, I 
value the 
flexibility and 
trust I have to 
balance my 
professional and 
personal 
responsibilities.

”

ANNABEL HONOUR
SENIOR RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT

Joining the group as a graduate, I have now 
been working for Gattaca for over 8 years.

I started my career working in the Graduate 
Recruitment team and was responsible for 
recruiting engineering talent from universities 
across the UK. From this role, I was able to 
move into a marketing role to focus on general 

candidate attraction and large scale recruitment campaigns for 
various areas of the business. 

I decided I wanted to move into an engineering recruitment role, 
given the background I had built, and was lucky enough to be 
given this flexibility and opportunity by the business. I moved into 
a well-established team where I received excellent support and 
training to become a Senior Recruitment Consultant. I have taken 
some time off from my career for maternity leave and now work 
part time, but very successfully. It gives me a huge amount of 
enjoyment to help people into new careers.

KATIE SELVES
GROUP HEAD OF LEGAL

When I joined Gattaca in 2016, as Head of 
Employment, I was immediately impressed 
with the value the business placed on its 
employees, the passion of the people who 
work here, and the inclusive and positive 
culture this creates. Since then, I have been 
promoted to Group Head of Legal. In my role 

I am involved in a number of diversity and inclusion initiatives, 
including our Diversity Champions and our recently launched 
‘Lean In’ circle. These initiatives promote the importance of our 
diverse workforce and, in particular, support us in our aim to 
identify, nurture and develop talented women into more senior 
roles within the business. Consistent with this, Gattaca is mindful 
and respectful that employees have a life outside of work and, as 
a mother of two small children, I value the flexibility and trust I 
have to balance my professional and personal responsibilities.  

I enjoy the opportunities I have to interact with and learn from 
my colleagues across all areas and locations of the business, and 
I look forward to continuing my professional development and 
progressing my career in a culture where high performance is 
recognised and rewarded regardless of gender.
