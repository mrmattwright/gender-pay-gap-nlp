These barley varieties deliver a high level of extract and fermentability, which when combined together provides the optimum level of predicted spirit yield.  The majority of Crisp distilling malts are produced in our sites located in Scotland. The barley is malted by delicately adjusting temperatures, air supply and water levels to balance protein and cell wall modification. It is then skilfully kilned retaining the high levels of enzyme activity desired by distillers.     Premium Pot Still Malt    Premium Peated Malt    High Diastatic Malt                Food Malt  Our malt is full of flavour and ideal for food manufacturers. You will discover a variety of malty flavours, colours and texture.  The malt that we produce is Kosher certified by the London Beth Din Kashrut Division (KLBD) and is also certified as Halaal by the Muslim Food Board (U.K).  Organic malt is also available, as we are registered under the Soil Association organic standards.  To ensure we produce malt that is 100% suitable for food manufacturing, we insist on performing our own internal hygiene and food safety checks.  Food malt can be delivered in bulk loads and our brewing malts are perfectly suitable to use in food manufacturing.
