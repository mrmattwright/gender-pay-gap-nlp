Gender pay gap report AT April 2017

Gamesys fully supports the initiative to make 
gender pay gaps more transparent.

At Gamesys we want to build a company so 
diverse that nobody even notices.

Our success is centred on our people – their 
di(cid:31)erent brains, di(cid:31)erent experiences and 
di(cid:31)erent origins represent our collective 
strength.

The only way we distinguish our employees is 
by whether they can choose, and we can o(cid:31)er, 
work that they love doing and can excel at. We 
then give them the tools and opportunities to 
crack on and be happy.

We challenge ourselves all the time to identify 
where and how we can improve our diversity 
and inclusivity. 

01

We strive to create a culture where ideas and 
challenge can come from anywhere, to provide 
a platform for frank exchanges and debate 
about issues, where there are not always 
simple answers.

This is a major contributory factor to our 
gender pay gap, along with reduced 
representation of women in our business at 
the most senior levels. Of course, we always 
ensure we pay equally for the same roles. 

Questions like, how do we attract more women 
into Tech? How do we ensure all our people 
processes are as bias free as possible? How do 
we educate all employees to be more 
inclusive?

At Gamesys, we do have a gender pay gap as 
you’ll see in the report. Over half of our 
employees in London are Technical, and like 
most companies, we need to redouble our 
e(cid:31)orts to (cid:30)nd more women technologists. 
We’re proud of our technical women, we just 
don’t have enough of them today!

You’ll see in the report where we are applying 
energy and investment to continually improve 
inclusivity and gender balance across the 
Gamesys Group.

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?

The gender pay gap is the di(cid:31)erence between the average pay between 
all women and men regardless of their role, position and seniority.

As required for reporting, here you will see data for Gamesys and for Mice and 
Dice, our two UK based companies. Gamesys houses 493 employees including 
our Technical, Design, Games Studios, Corporate Services and Group Board 
teams. Mice and Dice houses 363 employees including our Marketing, 
Customer Support, Chat and Entertainment Programming teams.

•  The mean pay gap is the di(cid:31)erence in the average hourly pay for  
    women compared to men. 

gender pay gap

•  The median pay gap represents the di(cid:31)erence in hourly pay between  
    the salary mid-point average of women and men.

Equal pay means paying the same for the same role, regardless of 
gender.

*14% shows, as an example, that men’s mean pay is 14% higher than women’s 
mean pay due to the higher representation of senior men in the employee group.

gender BONUS pay gap

Once probation is completed, all employees across Gamesys are eligible for a 
bonus regardless of role. We run a performance review every 6 months to 
assess this fairly. Therefore the di(cid:31)erence in employees receiving a bonus 
relates to the varying numbers of women and men in probation at the time of 
the report.

THE NUMBERS CONT.

When we look at our company by department, we can see a reduced gender 
pay gap. In Marketing, there is a slight median male gender pay gap. 
Customer Support is our most gender neutral department in terms of pay.

This is the proportion of men and women in each pay quartile. 
Each Gamesys quartile represents 119 employees and each Mice 
and Dice quartile represents 87 employees.

04

We have trained our hiring managers how to run 
fair and bias free selection, and continually 
improve other elements of our processes, such
as ensuring our job descriptions do not have a 
gender skew or lead to unconscious bias in any 
way. 

We are 2018 sponsors of ‘Women of Silicon 
Roundabout’, Europe’s biggest Technology 
event for women. 

We fly the flag for diversity by actively 
participating in working groups, panels and 
conferences.  

We monitor and benchmark our pay and 
reward decisions to ensure we are o(cid:31)ering 
fair and equal pay for our employees.

We support bespoke training and education 
events for our talented women. 

We also provide unconscious bias training 
across the business.

We’re establishing talent management 
processes that will actively support women’s 
development, with tailored coaching and 
personal development.
