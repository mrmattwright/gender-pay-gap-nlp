GENDER PAY GAP REPORTING 
Across the UK There is currently an average gender pay gap between men and 
women’s pay of 13.9% (ie women on average earn 13.9% less on average than men 
across the UK).  As an employer we are required by law to carry out Gender Pay 
Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 
2017.  
This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the 
average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve 
publishing individual employees data. 
We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website 
within one calendar year of April 5th 2017 
We can use these results to assess: 

the levels of gender equality in our workplace 
the balance of male and female employees at different levels 

• 
• 
•  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded. 

The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender 
pay gap.  The Trust has always worked hard to ensure that there is a fair system of 
pay across the Trust and this effort is bourne out in the results of our report. 
Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on 
employee gender. We establish this by using our existing HR and payroll records.  
 
In April 2017 The Trust employed 307 staff.  Of these, 183 were male and 124 were 
female. 
 
BASIC HOURLY RATES OF PAY 
 The Trust found that there was NO Gender pay gap on mean salaries between male 
and female employees, and a -3% paygap on the median basic hourly rate. This 
means that there is a very slightly higher rate of pay for female employees across the 
Trust as a whole.

BONUSES 
Across the Trust 21% of female employees received bonus payments and/or 
commission over the past 12 months, compared with 11.4% of male employees.  The 
average bonus for a female employee was £4,920, whereas the average bonus for a 
male employee was £6,776, giving a gender pay gap of 27%. This was skewed 
somewhat by one large bonus, and the adjusted figure if the outlier is removed shows 
the average male bonus as £4,931, giving a 0% paygap between bonus payments.

The Median female bonus payment was £3,500 and the median male bonus was 
£1,368. This is a gender pay gap of -156%. This shows that the mid-range for bonuses 
for male employees was less than half of that for female employee receiving bonuses. 
Bonus payments are for the large part linked to specific jobs, within sales and 
fundraising.  Across the Trust there are a higher proportion of women in these roles 
than men, which accounts for the higher levels of bonus payments to women.

2017 Gender Pay Gap Reporting 
 
This shows a relatively even split between male and female empoyees at each level 
within the pay scale.  If anything there is a slightly higher percentage of female staff 
within the higher level salary bands across the Trust. 
 
SUMMARY 
The figures shown in our gender pay-gap report show that the Trust has a pay 
structure and other processes which ensure that discrimination based on gender is 
not currently an issue within the Trust.
