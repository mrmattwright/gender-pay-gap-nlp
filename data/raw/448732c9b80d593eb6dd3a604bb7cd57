GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

What is the 
gender pay gap?
The gender pay gap is a measure of 
the  difference  in  average  earnings 
between  men  and  women.  The 
gender  pay  gap  differs  from  equal 
pay  as  it  is  concerned  with  the 
differences 
in  the  average  pay 
regardless of role.

Introduction
I welcome the government’s initiative 
to improve the transparency of data 
around  gender  pay,  as  it  helps  us 
accelerate  the  actions  required  to 
make work fairer and more inclusive 
for  everyone.  I  am  passionate  that 
high  performing  talent,  regardless 
of background or gender, can reach 
their full potential.

The report this year tells us we have 
work to do to reduce and ultimately 
close  our  gender  pay  gap  here  at 
House of Fraser.  We have an exciting 
programme  of  changes  underway 
to continue us on the journey.  

OUR BUSINESS
At  House  of  Fraser  we  employ  6,258  people  across  two  legal 
entities House of Fraser (Stores) LTD and James Beattie LTD. The 
detail in this report covers the gender pay data for both of these 
entities. Of the 6,258 people employed, 5,832 work for House of 
Fraser (Stores) LTD and 426 work for James Beattie LTD. 

I commit that we will listen and work 
with  all  colleagues  and  partners  of 
House of Fraser to learn from others, 
share what works and crucially trial 
new practices to close the gap.

OUR GENDER PAY GAP FINDINGS
What is the median? 
The median figure is reached by listing all of the hourly 
rates in order and selecting the middle number. The 
median gap is reached by calculating the difference 
between the male and female figure as at 5 April 2017.

What is the mean? 
The  mean  figure  is  reached  by  adding  up  all  of  the 
hourly rates and dividing the total by the number of 
results in the list. The mean gap is the difference in 
the male and female mean as at 5 April 2017.

OUR GENDER PAY GAP FOR 
SALES ADVISERS
For 
Sales  Advisers  which 
represent 64% of our headcount, 
the mean figure drops from 18% 
to 2%, therefore for the majority 
of our colleagues the gender pay 
gap is minimal.

OUR GENDER PAY GAP 
There are two key issues affecting our gender pay gap. Firstly, we have 
a higher proportion of women in part time roles and secondly there are 
more men in senior roles. 

Where colleagues at the middle of the pay scale are compared, the gap 
is minimal, at 1%, but when you take the whole business into account, 
the gap is 18%. Our median rate is significantly better than the reported 
Retail and UK rate* and our mean rate is in line with the UK rate.

OUR BONUS GAP FINDINGS
Our Gender Bonus Gap
The  difference  between 
the 
average  bonus  received  by  male 
and  female  colleagues  as  at  5 
April 2017. 

What is included in the bonus calculation? 
For the purpose of gender pay reporting bonus includes: ad hoc 
incentives,  long-service  awards,  employee  of  the  month  awards, 
commission scheme payments and recruitment referral schemes. 
Proportion of male and female colleagues that received a bonus in 
the 12 months leading up to 5 April 2017. 

MEDIAN 56%

UNDERSTANDING OUR GENDER BONUS GAP 
The gender bonus gap is due to the fact that we only paid a small 
number of bonus payments during the reference period and a 
high number of these were related to historical commission and 
incentive schemes.
