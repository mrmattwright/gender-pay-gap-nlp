Gender Pay Gap Results  

 

The Mungo Foundation employs approximately 700 staff, including a regular 
pool of Relief Workers to support effective service delivery. We have completed 
our Gender Pay Gap Report as required by the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay 
Gap Information) Regulations 2017, for publication by the April 2018 deadline.  

Gender Pay Gap is often confused with Equal Pay; however, it is different. 
Gender Pay Gap relates to the difference between the average earnings of 
men and women, over a period of time, irrespective of their role or seniority. 
Equal pay concerns relate to where one gender receives less pay for carrying 
out the same or similar work.  

As with other social care organisations our workforce is mainly female, with 
women making up 76% of our staff.  We have a pay structure that does not 
differentiate between men and women in the role and all other payments 
above basic salary, e.g. sleepover allowance, on call payments are paid at a 
standard rate. We do not pay bonuses at any level within the organisation.  

Following analysis of our salary information at 5 April 2017 we are delighted to 
report the following results: 

 

 

Median Pay Gap = 0%   

 

 

  Mean Pay Gap = -5% 

 

 

These results reflect the fact that we have an exclusive female senior 
management structure. Our negative Mean score compares with a national 
reported average of 18% across all sectors and industries in the UK.

Gender Pay Gap – Our Values  

The Mungo Foundation is proud to be a joint signatory, with our recognised 
Trades Union UNISON, to the Scottish Government’s Fair Work Framework and its 
vision of “people in Scotland having a world-leading working life”. The Mungo 
Foundation recognises the benefits this brings, not only to our employees but to 
the people we support and our wider communities. We are committed to joint 
working and positive engagement with our workforce. Ensuring that together, 
our focus, plans and activities seek, at all times, to promote the aims and 
aspirations of the Fair Work Convention. 

We currently pay all staff at or above the Scottish Living Wage and were one of 
the first social care providers in Scotland to do so.   We have recently embarked 
on an organisational wide job evaluation process across the organisation.  This is 
being managed jointly with UNISON and ACAS to ensure independence and 
objectivity. Following the development of an agreed factor plan we will review 
each post against others to ensure equality and fairness exists across all our pay 
scales.   

Our workforce stands at 76% female and 24% male.  As can be seen from the 
table detailing the % of male and females in post we have an exclusive female 
senior management structure with the majority (79%) of our next level 
management being female. 

Breaking our salary structure down into pay quartiles demonstrates a split 
consistent with our total male/female population, apart from the upper quartile 
where more females are in the higher earning quartile.  

In an effort to recruit more males into our sector we have engaged in 
advertising at football grounds and on targeted radio programmes that would 
have a mainly male audience.  We work to ensure that we have a gender 
balance across our HR practices as far as possible e.g. job evaluation 
committee and recruitment panels.  We have also introduced development 
into management opportunities, which has offered six males the opportunity to 
act up into supervisory posts.
