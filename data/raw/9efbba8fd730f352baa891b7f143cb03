BDO Modern Slavery Act Statement 2017  View our statement  View 2016 statement   Gender Pay Gap Reporting  The culture at BDO encourages everyone to be themselves and our core purpose is to ‘help people succeed’. Diversity and inclusion plays a huge part in maintaining a workplace where anyone can reach their potential. It is about making a sustainable and measurable difference to business culture and performance by creating an environment where everyone is valued and feels valued.  We recognise that reporting on gender pay helps to focus attention and encourages the market to work together to create a better balance. We have been addressing the issue of gender balance for some time. We have been working to make senior roles more attractive to women – and our ratios improve each year. Our gender pay reporting analysis is consistent with our peers and we have many success stories to share. However, we want to do better and will focus on gender diversity – in fact all diversity – in order to continue to be a workplace where all our people can thrive.  Read our Gender Pay Report 2017, in line with the Government’s regulations, here .  We have also gone further than the Government’s requirements and looked at our partner pay gap to ensure we have a full view of our gender balance challenge.
