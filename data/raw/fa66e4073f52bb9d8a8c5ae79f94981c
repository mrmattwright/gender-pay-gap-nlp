Pay 
The Governing Body of Kings’ School is committed to the principle of equal pay for all 
employees, irrespective of gender, and ensures that it meets the requirements of the 
Equal Pay Act 1970.   

The school’s approach to pay is set out in the school’s pay policy and the Governing 
Body aims to achieve equality in its pay and reward arrangements.  The Governing Body 
ensures that teaching staff are paid the correct salary and allowances in accordance with 
the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document, a national statutory document 
regulating pay of teaching staff.    

The Governing Body ensures that school support staff are paid the correct salary and 
allowances in accordance with the Employment in Hampshire County Council (EHCC) 
2007 Agreement and subsequent variations.  The Hay job evaluation scheme, which sits 
behind the EHCC agreement, provides an objective and gender neutral framework to 
evaluate the jobs that are carried out within the school.     

Our gender pay gap of 24.1% is not as a result of paying men more than women for the 
same or equivalent work. 

Bonus 

Bonus payments indicated are for performance related payments, under which a one-off 
payment may be awarded to a member of staff.
