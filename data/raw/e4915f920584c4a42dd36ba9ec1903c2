David Knight, CEO  We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. The furniture sector has traditionally been male dominated. Retail sales teams make up the majority of our workforce, a division within which our average gap is 5% mean, however as a business we provide a full service for our customers, and roles in distribution and upholstery do attract a predominantly male workforce, which explains why our hourly pay gap is higher than the national average.  We have been very successful in recruiting female workers into roles within our Head Office and administrative roles within our stores, where we are able to offer a higher degree of flexibility. We are committed to continuing to promote our flexible working policies across our business with a view to attracting and retaining female candidates and supporting their progression through the business.
