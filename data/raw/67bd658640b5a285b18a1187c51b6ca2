We aim to eliminate any gender bias in our pay and remuneration systems and understand that equal pay between males and females is a legal right in accordance with the Equality Act 2010, Public Sector Equality Duty and European law. The current mean gender pay gap at Tower Bridge Homes Care is -3.98%, this is based on hourly pay rates as at 5th April 2017. This gap shows a small negative gender pay gap, which suggests that on average females earn moderately more than males in employment at Tower Bridge Homes Care. Below we have identified the factors that we believe contribute to this gap: Tower Bridge Homes Care is part of Holmes Care Group Ltd, a Company operating within the Care sector. The care sector in the UK is known to have predominantly female workers and this is reflected by the fact that there are only 55 male employees in the sample whereas there are 349 female employees in the sample. Due to the disproportionate numbers of females in the business it would be surprising if there wasn’t a gap showing females as higher earners. There is no pay gap when considering median pay rates. When we look at pay rates for individual roles it is clear that there is no pay gap between males and females; whereby everyone with the same job title is on the same pay rate, regardless of gender. The pay quartiles show that whilst there are some differences in quartile 2 and 4, proportionally pay is relatively equal across the Company; 13% of the sample are males and 86% are females therefore if we had no pay gap across the Company these would be the figures we would expect to see in each quartile.

The staff saw him as a person.
