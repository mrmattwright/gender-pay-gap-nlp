This report was approved by the Board on 28th March 2018  and is signed on its behalf by: J. W. Goodwin, Director     Gender Pay Gap Report 2017    Difference in mean pay during pay period between male /female relevant employees  18.4%    Difference in median pay during pay period between male /female relevant employees  20.3%    Number of male/female relevant employees  Quartile  MEN  WOMEN    Upper (75-100%)  94.3%  5.7%    Upper Middle (50-75%)  86.2%  13.8%    Lower middle (25-50%)  83.9%  16.1%    Lower (0 - 25%)  85.1%  14.9%        Gender Bonus Gap Report 2017    Difference in mean bonus pay received 12 months before 5th  April between male/female relevant employees  -29.2%    Difference in median bonus pay received 12 months before 5th  April between male/female relevant employees  -600.0%     MEN WOMEN    Proportion of male/female relevant employees who received a bonus 12 months before 5th  April  99.1%  100.0%        Contextual Information (voluntary)  - Analysis and interpretation of reports and explanation for differences  The Gender Pay Gap report shows that the difference in median pay between men and women is 20.3% but the difference in mean pay is slightly lower at 18.4%.  The percentage of relevant males working on the snapshot date is 87% compared to 13% of relevant females.  The high male to female ratio is a direct result of working within the engineering sector which is historically male orientated and, although the Company is championing female apprentices to fill future engineering and management roles, the take up by females is still disappointingly low as is the talent pool for experienced female applicants.  However, the Company continues to focus on increasing the recruitment of female employees.  The report has been based on the number of contracted hours worked but it should be noted that Managers and Directors work longer hours than this which is not included in this analysis. Such commitment is therefore reflected in their salaries whereas hourly paid employees are paid for all overtime worked above their contracted hours which is not reflected in the report.  The Gender Bonus Gap report shows that the mean and median bonus pay calculations are more favourable for female relevant employees. This is a feature of the higher percentage of male relevant employees.
