Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing the pay gap is between their male and female employees.  Gender pay gap reporting differs from an equal pay comparison, whereby there is a direct comparison of 2 people or groups carrying out the same, similar or equivalent work.  We have always considered our people to be our best ambassadors and we want to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce throughout the business at all levels.
