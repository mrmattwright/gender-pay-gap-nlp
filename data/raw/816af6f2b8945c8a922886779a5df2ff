The main aims of the code are to:   Drive up quality in services for people with learning disabilities that goes beyond minimum standards  Create and build a passion in the learning disability sector to provide high quality, values-led services  Provide a clear message to the sector and the wider population about what is and what is not acceptable practice  Promote a culture of openness and honesty in organisations  Promote the celebration and sharing of the good work that is already out there.             Disability Confident Employer  Hft is positive about employing and retaining people with disabilities. As a Disability Confident Employer, Hft is helping to ensure that disabled people have the same opportunities to fulfil their potential and realise their aspirations that people without disabilities do.  Through Disability Confident , the government is working with employers such as Hft to:   challenge attitudes towards disability  increase understanding of disability  remove barriers  ensure that disabled people have the opportunities to fulfil their potential and realise their aspirations             Modern Slavery Statement  Following the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, a statement is required from all organisations with an annual turnover exceeding £36 million, to provide greater awareness of the dangers of modern day slavery and to improve transparency within supply chains.  As a charity committed to care, choice and independence we welcome this legislation and recognise the need to engage with this issue. You can download a copy of our statement here.            Gender Pay Gap Reporting Statement  It’s our Support Workers’ dedication to ensuring that the people we support have the opportunity to live the best lives possible that has made Hft the highly rated charity that it is today. Just as we have campaigned to see people employed in learning disability services continue to be paid fairly for the exceptional work they do, so too are we working to ensure that someone’s gender does not affect the wage they receive. So we are pleased to publish our Hft Gender Pay Gap Report for 2018.             Memberships  Hft holds membership with a number of different sector bodies and organisations that either work towards improving the lives of people with learning disabilities, or support charities such as Hft to maintain our high standards and effectiveness.  British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD)  Hft is a member of BILD , one of the leading learning disabilities organisations in the UK.  BILD works to ensure that people with learning disabilities are valued equally, are able to participate fully in their communities and are treated with dignity and respect. Our membership of BILD helps ensure that we’re kept up to date with the latest thinking and development in the field of learning disabilities to inform our practice, and help us to improve people’s lives.  BILD also campaigns for proper funding for support for people with learning disabilities and their family carers, and against bad practice as witnessed at Winterbourne View.            Voluntary Organisations Disability Group (VODG)  Hft is a member of the VODG , a group of over 80 leading voluntary sector and not-for-profit disability organisations that works on behalf of its members to influence and develop social care policy, build relationships with government and other key agencies, promote best practice, and keep members up-to-date on matters that have an effect on service delivery.  VODG members work with around a million disabled people throughout the UK providing services that promote independence, choice and control. The VODG’s vision is a world where everyone with a disability has full choice and control.            The European Network for Technology Enhanced Learning in an Inclusive Society (ENTELIS)  The ENTELIS project brings together nine partners from across the European Union plus one partner from the United States, with the goal of addressing some of the issues around accessing assistive technology and information & communication technologies that are experienced by many people with disabilities and the elderly. Other organisations have joined the consortium as Associate Partners.  ENTELIS aims to reduce this digital divide by developing a sustainable network of organisations that collaborate in the development of strategies and policies which will help ensure that people of all ages, with or without disabilities can access and benefit from technology.  Hft is an Associate Partner in ENTELIS. We provide knowledge and expertise in Personalised Technology and how this can be applied to different groups.            Learning Disability Voices  Hft is a founder member of Learning Disability Voices , a coalition of charities, not-for-profits, and independent companies that provide learning disability services in the UK, and that together represent 20% of the total sector provision.  In recent years the sector has had to cope with increasingly damaging local government cuts and has been forced to drive operational efficiencies to keep fees static. However, as we are paid for the hours of care we deliver, and as we support vulnerable people who often require 24-hour support delivered by one or more carers to ensure that their needs are met, we cannot reduce frontline staffing to cut costs further.  Learning Disability Voices was launched in response to the funding challenge this represents and exists to champion the learning disability sector and push for crucial policy changes to ensure a sustainable future for quality learning disability care.  You can download the Learning Disability Voices Manifesto here .            European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities (EASPD)  Hft is a member of the European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities (EASPD) , a European umbrella organisation representing more than 15,000 support services for people with disabilities across Europe. EASPD aims to promote equal opportunities for people with disabilities. We are also members of EASPD’s Interest group on assistive technology or Person-centred Technology (PCT). Sarah Weston, Hft’s Innovation Manager , is co-chair of the Interest group.            Telecare Services Association (TSA)  Hft is a member of the Telecare Services Association (TSA) – the industry body for technology enabled care (TEC) services. The TSA aims to drive growth in the TEC industry by driving strategy, innovation, choice and standards to enhance people’s independence and quality of life.
