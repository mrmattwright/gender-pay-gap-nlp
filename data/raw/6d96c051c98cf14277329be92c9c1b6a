This is based on a snapshot date of 31 March 2017.  You can read the full report here - King's College Hospital Foundation Trust - Gender Pay Gap Report  The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings and is being reported by all Trusts in three categories – Hourly; Pay Quartiles and Bonus Pay.  The Trust’s gender pay gap is largely due to the proportion of male consultants in the upper quartile of our pay distribution.  Hourly Rate (Women's)  Mean: 23.63% lower Media: 17.5% lower  The Trust's Pay Quartiles   Quartiles Men (%) Women (%) 1 (Lower Quartile) 20.83 79.17 2 (Lower Middle Quartile) 18.16 81.84 3 (Upper Middle Quartile) 18.62 81.38 4 (Upper Quartile) 39.61 60.39 Clinical Excellence Awards (“Bonus Payments”)  Forty-three members of staff are in receipt of Clinical Excellence Awards (CEAs). CEAS are the only bonuses paid in King’s. CEAs are not awarded automatically and must be applied for. They recognise and reward NHS consultants who perform ‘over and above’ the standard expected for their role. Awards are given for quality and excellence, acknowledging exceptional personal contributions and often relate to length of service. For the purposes of this report those receiving CEAs at levels 1 to 8 have been included in the calculation for mean hourly rate and excluded from the bonus calculation. Women's Bonus: Mean: -13.54% higher Median: 00.00% What are we going to do? The Trust is committed to closing the Gender Pay Gap by: Ensuring that gender equality is an integral part of our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy; Continuing to ensure gender balance and independence on all recruitment panels through yearly audits; Exploring areas that be influencing the Gender pay gap; Discussing the Trust’s Gender Pay Gap data at Executive Board and Education Workforce Development Committee.
