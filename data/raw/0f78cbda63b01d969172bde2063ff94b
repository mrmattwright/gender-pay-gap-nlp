This reflects the global and multi-cultural nature of the business and our aim is to maintain an environment that treats everyone fairly and equally.  We have produced a gender pay report (for 5th April 2016 to 5th April 2017) to help us understand how the average earnings of our male and female employees differ.  Our report looked into the difference between the average earnings of men and women working at Miki Travel Ltd. At the time of our report, we employed 413 people in the UK. Of these, 271 (65.61%) were women and 142 (34.38%) were men.  OUR GENDER PAY GAP REPORT  The tourism industry is a greater employer of women, at the junior and mid levels, compared to other sectors.  Our pay and bonus gaps at the lower quartile and lower middle quartile, reflect sector trends, with more women employed at the junior levels.  We have a more equal balance between male and females, in the upper quartile pay band.  Overall, a similar proportion of male and female staff received a bonus.

We will be requiring our recruiting partners to provide diverse candidate lists, at all levels.  We recognise that flexibility is important to staff retention and supporting further career progression, from the junior levels. We are reviewing our flexi-time system and approaches to flexible working, to ensure consistency and clarity for all.  We are planning to create a forum to capture ideas and feedback from all levels of staff, with the aim of strengthening the work and career experience for all.  The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodology set out in the  Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information Regulations) 2017    I confirm the data reported is accurate.
