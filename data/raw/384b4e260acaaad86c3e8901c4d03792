What is gender pay gap reporting?  From 6 April 2017 employers in Great Britain with more than 250 employees are required, by law, to publish figures annually regarding the gender pay gap on their website and on a government website.  The law requires employers to publish this data in six different ways: the mean and median gender pay gaps, the mean and median gender bonus gaps, the proportion of men and women who receive bonuses and the number of men and women according to quartile pay bands. The government is recommending no more than a 5% differentiation across all sectors.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earning between all men and women in an organisation. The government does not require employers to report on equal pay. Equal pay is the difference between the actual earning of men and women doing equal work. Gazprom Marketing & Trading is an equal pay employer.  Our pay gap data  At the time of data collection, in April 2017, the distribution of males to females was 65% male and 35% female in London.  In Manchester it was 55% male and 45% female.  The greater proportion of males to females will have an influence on both median and mean pay gap stats.  The gender pay gap percentages reported below show the complete gap we have between the averages of male versus female employees.    However, the non-demographic pay gap is a useful statistic to draw upon as it shows what the difference would be if we had an equal number of male and female employees; it removes the factor of the gender distribution to demonstrate a like for like comparison.  So, whilst our Mean Gender Pay Gap in London is 28.23%, our non-demographic pay gap is 8.81% and in retail the Mean pay Gap is 24.81%, whilst our non-demographic pay gap is 5.34%.

Whilst we are not within the Government’s ideal range of no more than 5% at present we are taking a number of actions, as outlined below, to reduce this gap.  At GM&T Group we apply equal opportunities to all areas of people management.  In order to better promote this, in 2017 we have introduced an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy, to clearly outline our intention.  We are also developing an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy, which will be formally completed and enacted in 2018.  This has so far led to training development for all people managers, who are key to making hiring decisions as well as development and promotion activities – including but not limited to the development of a People Manager Programme.  At the moment, the percentage of female employees in senior positions at GM&T is noticeably lower than males and we recognise this lack of diversity.  However, this does not mean that women have less opportunity to be hired, developed or promoted and as an equal opportunities employer, we endeavour for equality and fairness in all of our people management processes.  As an aide to this in relation to hiring for example, we have now introduced a behavioural competency interview tool and training for all hiring managers to use, to ensure a consistent and objective approach to rating all candidates and therefore hiring based on facts and objective judgements only.  Another key initiative is for employees to undertake unconscious bias training in the coming months.  Unconscious bias refers to the stereotypes, both negative and positive, that exist in our subconscious and affect our behaviour.  By implementing this type of training, your awareness of bias is raised and therefore future decisions are more likely made in an unbiased way.  Both the Unconscious bias and behavioural competency interview training will be mandatory modules in our People Manager Programme.  GM&T cares about its employees and intends to support the overall health of its employees through its wellbeing strategy.  The premise of GM&T’s wellbeing efforts is that employees cannot separate their work life entirely from other aspects of their lives, and so we are interested in supporting the wellbeing of employees in a holistic way.  Wellbeing at GM&T is about us providing services and support intended to promote the health and balance of employees in various aspects of their lives - this includes but is not limited to, our commitment to flexible working, work/life balance, supporting good mental health and creating an environment of social inclusion and physical health.  Job evaluation  In 2018 we will begin a revision of the job evaluation framework for GM&T Group.  A job evaluation is a systematic way of determining the value/worth of a job in relation to other jobs in an organisation.  It creates a clear and robust way to compare jobs, to assess their relative worth for the purpose of establishing a rational pay and banding structure.
