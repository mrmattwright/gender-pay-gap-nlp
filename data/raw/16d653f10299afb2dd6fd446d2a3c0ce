Staff Select Ltd is reporting its Gender Pay gap in line with Government regulations. The 
information contained in this document has been drawn from our HR system as at 5th April 
2017. On that date we employed 176 females and 105 males in the company who were subject 
to this analysis. As with most educational organisations we have a larger proportion of female 
employees. 
Following the UK government’s methodology which came into force in April 2017 we are 
reporting a mean gender pay gap of 4.2% and a median gender pay gap of 2.2% (People 
Management magazine have reported that the Education mean is 14.4% in 2017). 
Gender pay analysis compares average pay and bonus by men and women in the workplace. 
 
Gender pay analyses all employees and organises them in terms of their gender and pay 
rate. The calculations are presented in the ‘mean’ and ‘median’ for females and males.

Gender Pay Gap Analysis  
We do not deem that the small variances that exist are gender pay issues. These variances can 
be attributed to the higher proportion of females working in the lowest quartile of our workforce 
(see table below). Whilst we have a higher proportion of females in every quartile the gap is 
much larger in the lowest quartile which has caused the slight variance in pay.

Gender Bonus Analysis  
As part of the gender reporting, we also need to report on bonuses. Staff Select Ltd has 
reported that the mean bonus score is 4.01% and the median bonus score was 20%. 
 
Bonus schemes are only in operation for some job roles. The bonus schemes that exist vary 
significantly. Some bonus schemes are paid as percentage of gross annual salary whilst others 
are specific set values for meeting performance targets.

Further Actions  
We understand that the education sector as a whole generally has a higher female:male 
workforce ratio and we are no different. Our data shows that we have more females in all roles 
than we do males. Females are well represented throughout the company. Unless we recruit 
more males into the bottom quartile it is likely that a small gender pay gap will continue to exist.  
 
We will continue to monitor the gender imbalance in the lowest quartile. However, as an equal 
opportunities employer, we firmly believe in appointing the best candidate for the role, 
regardless of their gender or other factors. However, we will explore how we can attract more 
men into Staff Select Ltd in order to create a more even gender balance in particularly at the 
lowest level.
