Gender Pay Gap vs Pay Equality  The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay , which refers to whether a man and a woman are receiving equal pay for doing equal work and it is important to clarify this point. The gender pay gap is there to compare the average pay of all women compared to the average pay of all men in the same organisation â€“ regardless of role, seniority, experience or contracted working hours. Our gender pay gap results are influenced by factors such as societal norms, more males than females working in the Oil and Gas sector (particularly offshore) and individual choices in terms of self-selected flexible working practices. Having a gender pay gap does not mean that the pay practices at EnQuest are unequal. As a Company, we are absolutely committed to delivering equal pay and we do not believe that we have an equal pay issue within EnQuest.  Our Gender Pay Gap results  The information collected was based on the relevant pay period of:   the month of April 2017, for the purposes of calculating salary earned; and  the year April 2016 - March 2017 for the purposes of calculating bonus paid.   The results show that the average rate of total pay for women is 38.7% below the average rate of total pay for men and that the average bonus gap for women is 44.9% below the average bonus paid for men. On the comparison of median total pay and bonus, the percentage difference declines to 31.6% on pay and 23.1% on bonus. During the period April 2016 - March 2017, almost an equal percentage of women and men received a bonus (96% of women and 95% of men). When assessing these results, it is important to remember that the calculations take no account of the seniority or type of role of the individual, nor do they adjust for the impact of flexible working arrangements.  Our Commitment  EnQuest recognises the value of diversity in its workforce. The Company conducts regular benchmarking exercises to ensure that our salaries are comparable, regardless of gender, and that our recruitment process is fair and balanced. We are committed to delivering equal pay to our employees. However, we recognise that we need to work at addressing our gender pay gap over the coming years. Whilst we recognise that any improvements of this imbalance cannot be resolved immediately, we are committed to narrowing the gender pay gap in EnQuest over time.  We confirm that this statement is true to the best of our knowledge and belief.
