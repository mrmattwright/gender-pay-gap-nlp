Introduction

Our headline figures

We are a leading transport operator in the UK and North America. 
Each year, two billion passengers rely on us to get to work, school or 
college, to visit family and friends and much more.

In our increasingly urban and global world, the transport links we 
provide are more essential than ever.

The unique scale and the breadth of FirstGroup’s global expertise is 
our key strength. But to truly capitalise on this, and provide the best 
services for our customers, we recognise that the diversity between 
and within all the communities we serve must be reflected in our 
workforce.

We recognise that women have traditionally been under-represented 
in the UK transport sector, but as the industry evolves to meet rising 
customer expectations, and environmental challenges like congestion 
and air pollution, we need a much broader range of skills. This 
transformation is creating many more opportunities for women with 
backgrounds outside the transport sector to bring a variety of skills 
and experience from different industries and ways of doing things. I am 
delighted that already, women with skills from other sectors such as 
retail, energy, telecoms, media and consulting have joined FirstGroup 
and are making a real difference. You can read more about their career 
journeys and experiences as part of FirstGroup later in this report.

While we are proud of our overall gender pay gap figure, which reflects 
our absolute commitment to ensuring fairness in pay and progression 
regardless of gender, there is still much more to do; in order to 
close gender pay gaps where they do exist in some of our individual 
businesses, we are determined to accelerate our progress, increasing 
the number of women at all levels, and supporting them to take 
advantage of the wide range of career opportunities and interesting 
roles we can offer.

“   FirstGroup is committed 
to equality of opportunity, 
diversity and inclusion at 
every level, both in our 
Boardroom and across 
our wider business.

   We have made this 
commitment because 
we believe diverse 
experiences and 
attitudes help us better 
understand the needs 
of our customers and 
communities, and deliver 
more creative and 
innovative solutions.”

2  Gender Pay Gap report 2017

Our median gender 
pay gap is -9.1%

This means women’s 
median hourly pay is 9.1% 
higher than men’s.

Our mean gender 
pay gap is -2.2%

Explaining our results
The number of UK employees covered by our report at 5 April 
2017 is 22,236.
This comprises 19,407 men and 2,829 women.
Although only 13% of UK employees are female, more than 
61% of these women are in the upper and upper middle pay 
quartiles, whereas 52% of men are in the lower and lower 
middle quartiles. As a result, both the mean average and the 
median (midpoint) hourly pay for women are higher than that 
for men.

85%             of our 
companies had a 
gender pay gap below 
the UK national average

Understanding our gender pay gap

What actions are we taking?

At 5 April 2017 our overall median gender pay gap 
was -9.1%. Of our 20 operating companies in the UK 
with more than 250 employees, 17 of them (85%) had 
a median gender pay gap below the national average 
of 18.4%; five either had a gender pay gap of zero or 
women’s average pay was higher than that for men.

The gender pay gap shows the difference between 
the average hourly rate of pay of all men and all 
women in the organisation as a percentage of the 
average hourly rate of pay of men. This is different 
from ‘equal pay’ which considers whether men and 
women receive the same pay for work of equal value.

Although our overall UK figure shows that women’s 
median hourly pay is higher than men’s, we recognise 
that this is not the case for all of our operating 
companies. Analysis shows this is typically due 
to women being under-represented in our higher-
paid leadership and professional roles such as 
engineering and operational management. These 
roles are also more likely to be eligible for a bonus. 
The number of women in these roles has been driven 
by a number of historical factors, including the low 
proportion of females studying STEM subjects 
(science, technology, engineering and maths) at 
school and university, which are required in many of 
our higher-paid jobs.

The UK transport industry has traditionally attracted 
more men than women, with 85% of transport 
workers being male. The majority of our front-
line employees are men, and because historically 
many of our managers have been promoted from 
front line operational and technical roles, this also 
contributes to the under-representation of women in 
management positions.

You can access the gender pay information for each 
of our businesses on pages 12-13.

We recognise some of the issues we face are 
societal, and change will take time to achieve.

Across our operating companies, we are taking 
action to:

•   Increase the number of female applicants 

for all roles, given that in many of our operating 
companies, women make up less than 20% of 
the workforce

•   Encouraging women to stay and progress, 
through employment policies which encourage 
them to return from maternity leave and make it 
easier to combine a career with family life

•   Support and develop more women to move into 

higher paying roles

•   Ensure men are more aware and equipped to 
play their part in creating an inclusive workplace 
which is welcoming to women

Attracting more women applicants
We have refreshed our recruitment advertising 
photography and video content to ensure women 
are strongly represented and we now use the 
software tool ‘Textio’ to check the language of all our 
recruitment advertising material to ensure it is not 
unconsciously biased towards male candidates.

We are piloting new approaches to the way we 
describe roles which have traditionally attracted 
many more male than female candidates; in 
TransPennine Express, this has already resulted in 
38% of new hires to conductor roles being female, 
compared with 18% of the existing conductor 
workforce.

We are also thinking more broadly about where to 
promote our job opportunities to female students 
on relevant higher education courses who may not 
previously have considered a career in transport.

What actions are we taking?

Our graduate and apprentice programmes are 
important routes into higher paid technical and 
management roles, and we are looking at ways to 
ensure we promote these opportunities to more 
women. For example, in 2017 we ran a specific 
initiative to highlight our graduate vacancies to 
15,000 female undergraduates studying STEM 
subjects across the UK, using a targeted email 
campaign.

In the coming year, our Group Engineering and IT 
leaders will be launching an ambitious programme 
to attract more female candidates into engineering, 
maintenance and IT jobs; these are some of our 
best paid roles and offer good career progression 
opportunities which will help close the gender 
pay gap.

Our external recruitment partners and agencies are 
now required to demonstrate what they have done 
to deliver a diverse shortlist of candidates when 
making external hires.

Encouraging women to stay 
and progress
Across our operating businesses we have a variety 
of maternity pay and parental leave arrangements, 
backed by family-friendly and flexible working 
policies. Following a recent review, we made changes 
to some of our policies to ensure they continue to 
compare well with the external market and encourage 
existing female talent to return from maternity leave.

Many of our companies provide 24/7 service to 
customers; in response to feedback from employees, 
we are reviewing some of our shift designs in First 
Bus to explore how we can provide working patterns 
which enable both male and female employees to 
better combine their job at FirstGroup with family 
life. We anticipate this will help us attract and retain 
more women, and because many of our managers 
are promoted from frontline roles, it should also, over 
time, increase the number of women available for 
promotion to management roles.

We’re launching programmes designed to help more 
women prepare for and attain their first management 
and senior management roles, and to equip men 
to play their part in creating an inclusive workplace 
which is welcoming to women.

  Jenny Saunders
  Head of Stations, South Western Railway

“  You certainly don’t need to be an 
engineer to work in rail as there is so 
much variety – you can be anything 
you want to be.”

   As Head of Stations, Jenny is responsible for the 
delivery of safety, performance and customer 
experience at 188 stations. She began her career 
at retailer Gap before joining SWR in 2008. Jenny’s 
strong customer service ethos brought her success 
as Area Manager in several locations before being 
promoted to her current role in early 2014. During this 
time she had two children and believes that a good 
maternity policy, coupled with a supportive team 
and line manager, has made the transition to full time 
working mother much easier.

  Libby Scourse 
  Divisional Financial Controller, Greyhound

“  It was great to have the opportunity 
to move with my family and further my 
career in the US with Greyhound. 
I’m proud to be part of really first-rate 
teams at FirstGroup.”

   Libby is currently on international assignment to our 
Greyhound business based in Dallas, where she is 
the Financial Controller. Following training at Ernst 
& Young LLP, where she qualified as a Chartered 
Accountant, Libby worked for several companies 
before joining First Bus in 2013. She managed 
the financial operations for the Wales and South 
of England Region before promotion to Divisional 
Director of Financial Operations. In 2017, she seized 
the opportunity to broaden her experience in one of 
our North American businesses.

  Evie Carroll
  Graduate Trainee, First Bus

“  It’s a fantastic graduate scheme with 
the chance to see all aspects of the 
business first hand. People here are 
very friendly and supportive. I love the 
variety, it will help me decide which type 
of management role I want to take on 
after the two-year programme.”

   Following a degree in International Business at 
Edinburgh University, Evie was looking for a ‘hands 
on’ graduate scheme which would give her the 
opportunity to apply what she’d learned. The 
transport sector appealed because of the change 
and modernisation that’s ongoing, and she felt that 
First Bus offered a broad graduate scheme with lots 
of opportunities.

   Constance Baroudel
   Group Director of Strategy and Operational 
Performance, FirstGroup

“  It’s great to work somewhere that values 
experience from other industries and 
recognises the role women can play at 
every level of the business.”

   After studying corporate finance and international 
relations in Paris, Constance completed a Masters 
in International Accounting and Finance at the 
London School of Economics. She started her 
career in strategy consulting working across multiple 
sectors then went on to De La Rue plc. Whilst 
there, Constance gained executive management 
experience across multiple areas. In 2015, Constance 
brought the breadth of her skills to FirstGroup. In her 
current role, she is responsible for developing the 
Group corporate strategy and leading collaboration 
across our businesses.

  Stacy Thundercliffe
  Fleet Technical Manager, TransPennine Express

“  Although there is still a gender imbalance 
within engineering, I have always 
found FirstGroup really welcoming and 
helpful and have never experienced 
any prejudice because I’m female. It’s a 
really exciting place to be and has given 
me a great and rewarding career so far.”

   Stacy joined TransPennine Express as a Graduate 
Engineer in 2005. After 18 months in placements 
across the business, she became a Project Engineer 
and then a Fleet Engineer, whilst gaining Chartered 
Engineer status. To expand her experience, she 
spent five years at another rail company, before 
returning to FirstGroup in 2016 to the leadership role 
of Fleet Technical Manager.

  Tina Hayden Williams
  Mechanic, First Bus

“  I like everything about my job. It’s 
interesting and challenging – something 
different every day. I’ve never had a 
boring day!”

   Tina joined First Bus as an apprentice in the Bristol 
depot in 2013. During her training, she received the 
Apprentice Inspection Award in the Institute of Road 
and Transport Engineers Skills Challenge in 2016. 
Having qualified as a mechanic, she continued her 
development by completing an additional year to gain 
an electrical qualification to add to her skills. She has

   Louise Cheeseman
  Service Delivery Director, Hull Trains

“  I’ve been encouraged by some great 
male bosses and mentors and have 
taken the opportunities that I was 
offered. The rail industry has given me 
such an amazing career. I don’t want 
women similar to myself to miss out on 
such a great opportunity!”

   Louise is Service Delivery Director for Hull Trains. 
She started in the rail industry in 2001 as a guard 
with Northern Rail. Being quickly promoted through 
safety and operations roles, she became the General 
Manager for Docklands Light Railway, which included

2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Louise then 
travelled to Sydney to assist in the preparation of the 
Sydney Light Rail bid. A further two years was spent 
with Metrolink in Manchester as Service Delivery 
Director before she joined FirstGroup in her current 
role, which involves delivering a great experience for 
Hull Trains’ customers.

  Samyutha Bala
  Customer Experience Manager, GWR

“  I only planned to stay for six months but 
the railway pulls you in. I have received 
great support through GWR’s mentoring 
programme, as well as training and 
encouragement. I really love my job and 
I’ve decided that I want to stay in the 
rail industry.”

   Samyutha joined GWR in 2013 after studying for a 
Masters in Dentistry. Her first job at GWR was as 
a Despatcher in Operations. She was encouraged 
by her manager to apply for a role as Customer 
Ambassador. After two years doing this, she covered 
as a Duty Manager for several months before 
becoming a Customer Experience Manager in the 
marketing team, where she aims to improve all 
aspects of how customers interact with GWR.

  Audrey Simpson
  Bus Driver, First Bus

“ I always wanted to be a Bus Driver. 
After having kids, I saw an advert on the 
back of a bus and decided to go for it. 
Working on the Airport bus, I’m often 
the first person tourists speak to when 
they arrive in Glasgow. I love my job.”

   Audrey works on the flagship Glasgow Airport 
service based out of our Caledonia Depot. Before 
joining First Bus in 2008, mother-of-three Audrey 
previously worked in the school kitchens, then later 
as a Catering Supervisor at a local hospital but 
was always interested in changing career paths to 
become a Bus Driver.

  Amanda Burns
  Head of Marketing & Sales, GWR

“ It gives me a real buzz to know we’re 
leading the way for consumers and 
the industry. I always challenge myself 
and my team to ask ‘how can we 
improve and do things better?’. GWR 
and FirstGroup really embody this 
philosophy.”

   Amanda is Head of Marketing & Sales in GWR, a role 
she has held since 2016. She has experience from 
the airline sector in British Midland and BAA Airports, 
as well as with BUPA and most recently Tourism 
Ireland, where she set up a presence in new and 
developing markets in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East 
and Africa.
