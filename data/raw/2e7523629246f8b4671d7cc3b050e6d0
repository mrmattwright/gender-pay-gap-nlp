This report sets out our results in the year to April 2017 together with the contextual information and the initiatives we have underway to close the gender pay gap.  Our gender pay gap figures have been calculated in line with the regulations set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation.  I confirm that these figures have been verified and are accurate.  Jeremy Richardson, CEO  Christine Cooper, Head of HR​  April 2018  What is the gender pay gap and how is it calculated?  The “gender pay gap” is the difference between the average hourly rate of pay between all men and all women in a company.  The gender pay gap is very different from “Equal Pay”. This is the difference in pay between a man and a woman who carry out the same or similar jobs.  What is our pay gap?   The median hourly pay difference between male and female colleagues is 1.8%.    1.8% compares favourably with the median pay gap of 18.1% across all sectors of the UK economy (source: Office for National Statistics).    Our mean hourly average pay difference between male and female colleagues is 5.8%.   Our overall median gender pay gap is 1.8% which compares to a UK median gender pay gap of 18.1%  Our pay quartiles  Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile, each quartile contains 924 colleagues             ​     The pay quartiles show that we have a significant majority of female team members in all parts of our business.    We operate a transparent recruitment process that is based solely on ability and aptitude for the role in question.    We continue to review all of our recruitment policies to ensure that we are and remain an equal opportunities employer.   Pay information –bonus pay   All senior colleagues in home, regional management and support function roles are generally eligible to receive a bonus or incentive. Colleagues who work at home level participate in a bonus scheme that is based on the overall performance of their home (care quality, financial and team engagement) together with a set of personal objectives that are designed every year to support professional development and career progression. Regional management incentives are based on regional performance with the same criteria as those described above used. Those colleagues who operate in a national role are incentivised on whole business performance albeit that the bonus criteria are again consistent.    The median bonus pay difference Is 47.6%. This is principally as a result of a greater proportion of males in the higher grades and the higher bonus levels attached to these roles. The mean bonus pay difference between male and female colleagues is 84.1%.   Our median gender bonus gap is 47.6%                 Gender profile by band  Approximately 3,700 colleagues work across our business throughout the UK.   We have significantly more female colleagues than male.                  The table below shows the gender representation by quartile  Band  Female  Male  Total  Quartile One   83%   769   17% 155  100% 924  Quartile Two  85%   785  15% 139  100% 924  Quartile Three  80%   737  20% 187  100% 924  Quartile Four  80%  738  20% 185  100 % 923  Total   82% 3,029   158% 666  100% 3,695  Most bands contain a wide variety of pay families, and hence a wide selection of roles that offer different salaries (regardless of gender).   Our analysis of pay levels for comparable roles shows that men and women are paid fairly and appropriately for work of equal value   How brighterkind is tackling the gender pay gap  The gap in both our mean pay and median pay, whilst already significantly better than the national average, shows that there is still work to be done, and whilst we do not have an equal pay issue across the business, we are still taking steps to further reduce the gaps.  We have summarised below what we have already done and what we will be doing as we look to complete eliminate the pay gaps that exist currently.    What we have done so far  • Pay : We have conducted a detailed benchmarking exercise and ensured that there is consistent salary positioning upon appointment to roles within the business.  • Flexible working and part time : We have a programme of flexible working and continue to encourage new models of working in all of our care homes.  • Engaged our colleagues : We conduct annual team surveys which look at ways in which we can increase opportunities for female colleagues to progress throughout the organisation.  • Strong female representation in senior roles : 68% of the top 19 roles in the business are currently filled by females  • Analysis of exit interview data: We will review underlying trends of reasons for leaving which can then be addressed  • Unconscious bias training : From 2018 we will be introducing training for all of our people leaders.    We will continue to scrutinise our gender pay gap and explore ways to improve  • Analysis of exit interview data: We will review underlying trends of reasons for leaving which can then be addressed  • Unconscious bias training : From 2018 we will be introducing training for all of our people leaders.  We will continue to scrutinise our gender pay gap and explore ways to improve.
