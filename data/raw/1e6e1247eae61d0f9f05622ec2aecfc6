Commentary 

Overall, we have more men employed in the business than we do females 
which contributes to the gap, as does the impact of the upper quartile range. 
More men in the business were paid bonuses, which is largely due to the 
composition of our incentivised as opposed to salary only roles. However, we 
are immensely confident that we pay men and women equally for the same 
roles.
