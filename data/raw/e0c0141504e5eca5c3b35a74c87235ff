Following  the  introduction  of  gender  pay  reporting  legislation  all  employers 
with  250  or  more  employees  are  required  to  publish  statutory  calculations 
every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female 
employees.  Gender pay reporting shows the balance of men and women at all 
levels of the organisation and the effect this has on average hourly rates of 
pay.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all 
men and women in a workforce. 

 
 
Hansel is comprised of two legal employer entities: Hansel Foundation and Hansel Alliance.   At the 
time of reporting, 5 April 2017 Hansel Foundation employed 3 team members and Hansel Alliance 
employed 435 team members.  We have made the decision to report on both entities as we wish to 
embrace the advantages of considering our figures across the entire Hansel organisation. 
 
We have a much higher number of female team members (nearly three quarters) and we believe we 
have a good balance of male and female team members at senior and management levels.

(Quartile information divides employees into four groups ordered from highest to lowest pay.) 

Summary:    Our  overall  gender  pay  gap  (the  difference  between  hourly  rates  of  pay  for 
females and males) calculated by mean average is 5.74%. This is the percentage difference between 
the average hourly pay. This means we pay men 5.74% more than women. This is much better than 
our sector average.  
 
Our gender pay gap by median average is 0%.  This shows there is no difference between the mid 
points in the ranges of men's and women's pay. 
 
Analysis:   Overall  there  is  a  gender  pay  gap  of  5.74%  in  favour  of  males.  This  small  gap  is 
driven by quartile 1 where the pay gap is 21.93%. All other quartiles either have a negative gap (in 
favour of females) or no gap. Within quartile 1 there is close to a 50/50 female to male split within 
the 20 most senior posts, and this along with the Managing Director being male skews average pay 
calculations  in  favour of males where the  remainder  of  quartile 1 more  closely mirrors the other 
quartiles with a 75/25 split.  Consequently, if 3 of the 20 senior (including Managing Director) posts 
currently occupied by males were filled by females then our gender pay gap would be a single digit 
figure for this quartile, and negative (with higher average pay for females) overall.  
 
The gap in quartile 4 is -1.95% which indicates Hansel has a gap in favour of female workers for the 
majority  of  employees.  Our  lowest  paid  workers  are  supported  employees.  There  are  more  male 
supported employees than female. 
 
Quartiles  2  and  3  have  no  gap  or  a  near  insignificant  gap.  This  indicates  that  a  majority  of  our 
workers (mainly support workers) do not have a gap between male and female workers. The vast 
majority of these social care workers are paid the Scottish Living Wage irrespective of gender.   
 
Hansel  Foundation:    At  5  April  2017  the  gender  profile  of  Hansel  Foundation's 
workforce was 100% female therefore we do not have an overall gender pay gap or median average 
to report.   
 
Bonus Data:  Hansel does not award any bonuses therefore bonus data is not applicable. 
 
Actions:   This  is  the  first  Hansel  Gender  Pay  Gap  Report  which  has  been  produced  and  its 
contents have been noted by our Board of Directors.   
 
We have worked hard to deliver our commitment to fair and equal pay which is set out in our Team 
Strategy.  We believe that this report shows that we are paying fairly however we do recognise that 
we must be cognisant of the impact of any future pay changes. For this reason we will ensure that 
we conduct an equality impact assessment on any planned pay changes in future.  
 
Although we are pleased to only have a small gender pay gap we do recognise however that there 
are  other  actions  we  can  take  in  respect  of  gender  balance.  For  example  our  Board  of  Directors 
comprises a majority of male (unpaid) volunteer trustees and this gender imbalance is something we 
are actively seeking to address through our current recruitment campaign.  
   
We  will  continue  to  monitor  our  policies,  procedures  and  practices  to  ensure  that  they  are 
supporting our commitment to equality and reflect our core values of Respect and Diversity.

Managing Director
