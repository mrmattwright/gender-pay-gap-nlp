Within the recruitment sector roles advertised for temporary staff tend to be generic, not providing an arena for distortion between male and female workers, as highlighted by the median pay rates being the same.  The disproportionate mean bonus gap towards female staff is representative of the higher proportion of permanent staff being female. This same high proportion of female staff within the permanent population also explains the higher mean average pay, permanent staff are usually more highly remunerated than temporary workers.  Payment of bonuses to temporary workers is very infrequent and usually not of a substantial value.
