The Mandatory Gender Pay Gap Reporting proposes that organisations should, for the first mandatory report, capture data as a snapshot on 5 April 2017 and then publish their findings no later than 4 April 2018. This cycle will then continue year on year going forward with organisations being required to maintain the data on their websites for three years in order to show progress made. The Equality and Human Rights Commission defines the difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap as follows: 1. Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive equal pay, as set out in the Equality Act 2010. 2. The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings. Salaries at TMBC are determined through a grading system which evaluates the job and not the post holder. It makes no reference to gender or any other personal characteristics of existing or potential job holders. Therefore, we are confident that TMBC is paying the same salary to roles of equal value. The data below represents the gender pay gap snapshot data for TMBC as at April 2017 and is presented as required by the regulations. This information will be updated annually.
