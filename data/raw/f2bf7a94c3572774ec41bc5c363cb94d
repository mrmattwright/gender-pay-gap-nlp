We are happy to publish our gender pay gap information as per the new regulations and have referred to the ACAS guidance when calculating our figures.  The statistics are calculated using the snap shot date 5 th April 2017.  I can confirm that the following data is accurate:  James Simpson Finance Director     Gender Pay Gap  Our mean and median gender pay gap is negative so on average women are paid more than men. However, men and women doing equivalent jobs are paid the same.  Factors influencing our results are:   our work force being predominantly male  the small number of women employed in non-office based roles.  the majority of women we employ are in administrative roles with higher than average rates of pay.          Pay Quartiles  Our pay quartile disclosures show an average male to female ratio of 95:5. We have split our workforce into 4 quartiles ranked by employees hourly rates. The majority of women are in the top 2 quartiles. This was expected due to the mainly administrative and management roles they undertake.           Bonus Pay Gap  Based on a mean average the bonuses paid to men are 20% higher. This is due to the greater number of men in positions which attract bonus payments based on performance.  Based on a median average the bonuses paid to women are 97% higher. This appears to be at odds with the mean average. The reason for this discrepancy is that a large number of male employees from the non-office based workforce have received low value bonus payments. Although a lower proportion of women have received bonus payments they are of a higher value due to the positions they hold within the Company. As a result the midpoint of the two data sets shows a large variance.
