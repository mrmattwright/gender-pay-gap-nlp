The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the mean or median hourly rate of pay that male and female employees receive.  The mean pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings of men and women.  The median pay gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly earnings of male and female employees.  The figures in this report are based on the hourly rates of pay for staff as at 31 March 2017 (the ‘snap shot’ date) and relate to ‘full-pay relevant employees’, this means all employees who were earning their normal rate of pay in the period in which the ‘snap shot’ date fell.  Anyone who had unpaid leave or reduced pay due to maternity leave etc. has been excluded from the data.  We were also required to include bonuses paid to staff, however, we do not pay bonuses.  The hourly rate of pay for staff includes basic pay and responsibility payments before tax and pension deductions, but after salary sacrifice (child care vouchers).  Overtime pay is not included.  A Gender Pay Gap is different from ‘equal pay’. Equal Pay is the difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs. The Alpha Academies Trust pay male and female employees the same hourly rate if performing the same role.  There are many female employees employed at the lower end of the pay scale in part time/term time positions (clerical, education support, catering, and lunchtime supervisor), this is often a proactive choice, as it fits in with their work/life balance as the majority of support staff roles are part time.  The Alpha Academies Trust supports the fair treatment of all staff irrespective of gender through our transparent recruitment process, pay and professional development. We have specific policies for Equal Opportunities, Safer Recruitment and Pay.  We always recruit the best person for the job regardless of their gender.  All of our support staff roles are evaluated to ensure fair pay for the role.  All members of staff working in the same titled job roles are paid within the same levels regardless of their gender. We use scales set by the NJC (National Joint Council for Local Government Services). Staff move through the pay scales for their grade irrespective of gender.  Teaching staff are paid on set scales according to years of service, which is standard practice across the education sector.  To help in the retention of staff we support them, where possible, in part time working.  The Trust is committed to offering professional training to encourage staff to develop their career opportunities to their fullest potential.
