You can read the Gender Pay Gap Report for NPS Property Consultants here    The NPS business is traditionally male dominated in line with similar businesses in the construction industry. There is significant work underway to reduce this gap, and focus is on trying to attract and retain more female staff. Graduate recruitment, which will provide future senior staff, is beginning to attract more female candidates and our mentoring and coaching programmes should ensure we retain this talent. This work will remain in progress for some time.
