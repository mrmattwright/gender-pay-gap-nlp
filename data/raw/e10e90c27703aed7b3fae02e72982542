Reporting data for the pay period including 31 March 2017.  

 

 

 
Background & Gender Pay Gap Reporting Requirements  

 
New regulations took effect on 31 March 2017 (The Equality Act 2010 Specific Duties and Public 
Authorities Regulations 2017) that requires all public sector organisations in England employing  
250 or more staff to publish gender pay gap (GPG) information.  
 
The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of all 
male and female employees. It is expressed as a percentage of earnings and it is a measure of 
disadvantage. The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay is about ensuring men 
and  women  doing  similar  work  or  work  that  is  different  but  of  equal  value  (in  terms  of  skills, 
responsibility, effort) are paid the same. A gender pay gap could reflect a failure to provide equal 
pay but it usually reflects a range of factors, including a concentration of women in lower paid roles 
and women being less likely to reach senior management levels.  

 
Lincolnshire  Community  Health  Services  (LCHS)  is  required  to  publish  the  below  gender  pay  gap 
measures:  
 

 The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay for male and female employees  
 The difference between the median hourly rate of pay for male and female employees  
 The difference between the mean bonus pay for male and female employees* 
 The difference between the median bonus pay for male and female employees*  
 Proportions of male and female employees who were paid a bonus*  
 The  proportions  of  male  and  female  employees  in  the  four  quartile  pay  bands  (lower,  lower 

middle, upper middle and upper) 

*LCHS does not currently operate a bonus scheme and does not have a Clinical Excellence Awards scheme in operation 
 
The above measures are calculated using a ‘snapshot date’ and for public sector organisations this is 
the pay period which includes 31 March 2017. This statement therefore covers all LCHS employees 
including those on Bank contracts as at 31 March 2017. The data is taken from ESR.  
 
The  Trust  is  required  to  publish  this  information  within  one  year  of  the  snapshot  date  (i.e.  by  30 
March 2018) and by the same date every subsequent year. It should be published on a website that 
is accessible to employees and the public. The data also has to be uploaded on the governments 

‘Gender Pay Service’ reporting site.

*Please note the category entitled ‘other’ represents anyone who is not on agenda for change pay 
bands, for example apprentices and staff groups who have TUPE transferred into the organisation. 
 
The LCHS workforce is governed under the NHS Agenda for Change, excluding medical staff and 
very senior managers. It uses the NHS national job evaluation framework to determine appropriate 
pay bandings. This provides a clear process of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent 
work.  Each  grade  has  a  set  of  pay  points  for  annual  progression;  the  longer  period  of  time  that 
someone has been in a grade the higher their salary is likely to be dependent on performance.  
 
Figure 1 outlines that women are represented across all pay bands within LCHS with a 4:1 ratio of 
females  to  males  in  very  senior  management  (VSM).  The  highest  proportion  of  both  males  and 
females  are  concentrated  within  Band  6  posts.  A  significantly  higher  proportion  of  females  work 
within  band  3  posts  in  comparison  to males  and  further  exploration  is  needed  to  understand  any 
underlying reasons for this.

The mean gender pay gap for LCHS is 21.1%. This means that men are paid 21.1% more than 
women on average. The average is calculated by adding up the hourly rates of all men and all 
women and dividing by the total number of men and women. 
 
The median gender pay gap for LCHS is 11.5%. This means that when the hourly rates of all 
female and all male staff are put in order from smallest to largest, the middle rate is 11.5% higher 
than the middle rate for all female staff. 
 
The proportions of male and female employees in each quartile of the pay distribution 

The quartiles shown below in figure 3 are calculated by determining the hourly rate of pay and then 
ranking the relevant employees in order from the lowest to the highest.  The calculation requires an 
employer to show the proportions of male and female full-pay in four quartile pay bands, which is 
done by dividing the workforce into four equal parts; lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile 
pay bands.

Figure 3 highlights that the Trust employs more men in the higher banding categories than women 
which has an impact on the average hourly rate. LCHS has significantly less men employed when 
compared  to  women,  however,  of  those  employed  a  proportion  are  in  either  senior  or  specialist 
roles. 
 
Within  the  Medical  Workforce  the  male  workforce  is  2:1  to  the  female  workforce  with  a  high 
proportion of part time workers across the female population. This is an area our Medical Staffing 
team will be exploring further in order to make recommendations to the Trust.

Whilst  the  Trust  has  excellent  representation  of  females  across  all  levels  of  the  organisation,  this 
report shows that there are gender pay gaps due to the level and type of roles undertaken by our 
minority male workforce. We will continue to monitor and promote equality and diversity in order to  
close these gaps.  
 
LCHS can demonstrate that we are equal opportunity employer through policies and processes which 
support staff to make decisions, for example policies which support maternity, paternity and adoption 
leave, flexible working and disability leave.  LCHS takes a proactive stance regarding progression 
and development of talent within the organisation.  From the point of identifying a vacancy, there is a 
clear pathway for development through our talent pipeline, fully in line with our equal opportunities 
policy.   
 
The  Trust  is  committed  to  ensuring  an  equitable  workforce  and  we  will  continue  to  work  towards 
achieving the following actions in order to reduce the gender pay gap: 
 
 

•  Explore how we can attract more men into the organisation at the lower bands, to create a 

more even gender balance;  

•  Medical Staffing team to further investigate and advise on recommendations to the Trust in 

relation  to the medical workforce male / female composition;  

•  Raise  further  awareness  of  shared  parental  leave  entitlements  and  flexible  working 

opportunities through our training and communications; 

•  Take  account  of  gender  in  the  provision  of  leadership  opportunities,  including  the  recently 

launched Mary Seacole Leadership Programme; 

•  Continue to monitor any shifts in the gender pay gap data each year to identify any trends and 

analyse underlying causes.
