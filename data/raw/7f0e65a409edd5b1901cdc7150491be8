Tamdown Services: Gender Pay Gap Report 
 
What is the Gender Pay Gap? 
The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative 
to men’s earnings, rather than comparing like-for-like job roles. For example, ‘women earn 15% less than 
men per hour’. 
 
What does the legislation require? 
The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap information) Regulations 2017 require all private and voluntary 
sector employers with over 250 or more employees to publish their first gender pay gap report by 4 April 
2018. Employers will detail the gender pay gap for their organisation as it is in the pay period in which 5 
April (the ‘snapshot’ date) falls in each year from 2017 onwards.  
 
The report must appear on the employer’s website, in English, in a manner that is accessible to all 
employees and to the public, and once published must remain on the site for at least three years.  
 
Employers must publish the results, not the raw data on which calculations are based. This information 
must also be uploaded to a Government website, where it will be publicly available. Fines will be imposed 
on employers that do not comply. 
 
The six key metrics required by law are as follows: 

  The difference in the mean pay of full pay men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
  The difference in the median pay of full pay men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
  The difference in mean bonus pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
  The difference in median bonus pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
  The proportion of men and women who received bonus pay and; 
  The proportion of full pay men and women in each of the four quartile pay bands.
