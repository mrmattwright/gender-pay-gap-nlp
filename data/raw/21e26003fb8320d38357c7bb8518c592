Subsidiary Boards  39% of directors on our Group subsidiary boards are women.           Workforce  54% of our workforce is female.                              Why is this important?  To set our business up for long-term success, we need a workforce that reflects the customers we serve and our communities. To help us get there, we need to provide our female employees with support and encouragement to reach their full potential.  What do we do?  Throughout our businesses, from entry level roles to our executives we are committed to every level having 40% - 60% of either gender represented by 2020. In 2017, the NAB Board approved new measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity over the next three years.  “ Towards 2020: NAB’s road to gender equality” explains more about our 2020 commitment and outlines how we will get there.  In December 2016, we achieved the 2016 Workplace Gender Equality Agency Employer of Choice for Gender Equality citation.  We are proud to achieve this recognition as a demonstration of our continued drive and commitment to achieving gender equality.  Preparing women to be the leaders of tomorrow  Hiring women has never been about 'making up the numbers'. It's been about finding the right people for the right roles. We have a range of targeted programs and practices that provide women with opportunities, such as NAB Board Ready, which prepares women for board positions in the future and Breakthrough – a suite of development programs designed  to equip our female employees with the skills, knowledge and tools they need to transition to senior roles.  We’re focused on fairness  We are committed to fair and equitable remuneration for all employees that is consistent with our market and performance framework. We actively address barriers to equal pay between men and women. That’s why our gender pay gap continues to decrease and sits below the industry average.  We’ve also extended our 12 weeks’ paid parental leave to eligible parents at NAB, regardless of gender.  We believe it’s important to recognise the interdependencies at play when it comes to equality. In 2013, we became the first major bank in the country to introduce a domestic violence support policy.  We also know that that when women in business are visible it inspires change. We’ve signed a pledge to participant in more events for women. And as business leaders, we try to ensure that events we participate in have a gender balance.  In 2017, the UK Government introduced mandatory gender pay equity reporting for all UK-based organisations with more than 250 employees. The full version of the NAB UK Gender Pay Gap 2017 Report is available to view, and the information and analysis included only pertains to the London branch.

Support roles reporting in to these roles (for example, Executive Manager and Executive Assistant) are not included in the data.
