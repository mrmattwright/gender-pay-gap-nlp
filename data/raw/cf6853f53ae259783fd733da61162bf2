A key element of this approach will be to take further steps to improve our gender balance in order to positively impact our gender pay gap over time”     Shonaid Jemmett-Page MS Amlin plc Group Chairman     Gender pay gap     In April 2017, new legislation was introduced in the UK requiring employers with more than 250 staff to publish their gender pay gap, in order to promote greater transparency and action around pay disparities, a measure MS Amlin welcomes and is fully committed to.     The gender pay and bonus gaps are the difference between average earnings and bonuses for men and women. MS Amlin, like many other financial services organisations, has a gender pay gap as we have fewer women than men in the more senior roles which demand the highest pay.  We are confident that MS Amlin adopts equal pay for equal work but we will use the findings of our report to positively address our gender pay gap, and build on the measures we are already taking to bring further gender diversity to our organisation.     Our 2017 UK gender pay gap figures     Hourly & bonus pay gap  The figures below show our mean (the average of all male colleagues compared to the average of all female colleagues) and median (the mid-point of all male colleagues compared to the mid-point of all female colleagues) hourly gender pay gap and bonus gap for 2017. Our pay and bonus gaps are principally driven by a higher proportion of women in junior roles and a higher proportion of men in senior roles.
