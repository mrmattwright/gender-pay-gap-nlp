Our Loughborough facility is situated adjacent to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) comprising one of the largest remaining examples of unimproved alluvial flood meadow in Leicestershire. Nationally this habitat is becoming scarce due to changes in agriculture and flood plain development.   Extensive flooding provides a natural nutrient input.  The meadow contains grasses such as Meadow Foxtail, rough meadow grass and Rye-Grass etc.  Some herbs including Great Burnet, Common Knapweed and the Narrow-Leaved Dropwort (not found anywhere else in Leicestershire) grow in this meadow.  The Summerpool Brook forms part of the perimeter for Brush Traction and our discharges into it are subject to consent by the river authority and are monitored and measured by the Environment Agency.  Plants found in the brook are Reed Mace and Slender Tufted Sedge amongst other fen species.  Birds seen on and around the site are Lapwing, Skylarks and Wagtails along with all the common species   We are consistently working to and have achieved the internationally recognised environmental standard for ISO 14001.
