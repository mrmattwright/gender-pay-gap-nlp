The below calculations are taken from data held by the Company on the date of 5 April 2017.   The gender pay gap has been devised to show the difference in the average pay between all men and all women within an organisation.  As gender pay gaps are based on averages taken across a Company, they do not take into account factors such as job type or different seniority.   Therefore, this report differs to equal pay which considers men and women receiving equal pay for equal work.  What is the Fircroft gender pay gap?  The proportion of males and female in each pay quartile.  Having broken down our UK population in order of ordinary pay, from lowest to highest, and then divided this into four equal sub-populations (upper quartile, upper middle quartile, lower middle quartile and lower quartile) we can show how the distribution of men and women varies according to each quartile.  Percentage of male and female employees based in the UK offices across each quartile:              Percentage of male and female PAYE contractors working in Fircroft UK across each quartile:              Percentage of employees and contractors combined across each quartile:              The mean and median differences between male and female  Pay Gap  The mean pay gap shows the difference between the average hourly pay of men and women.  The median pay gap shows the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly pay of men and women.  Bonus Gap  The mean bonus gap shows the difference between the average bonus paid to men and women.  The median bonus gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of bonuses paid to men and women.   Understanding the numbers  It is important to reiterate that although we have a gender pay gap, this does not mean that men are paid more than women for equivalent work.  We are confident that whilst there is a gender pay gap that this is not an equal pay issue as all our research shows.  Therefore, we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our organisation.  We believe the gender pay gap is driven by two factors.   The higher proportion of men in more senior (higher paid) roles; and  The higher proportion of women in more junior (lower paid) roles    Addressing the gap  We will continue to monitor our gender pay gap, and continue focusing on ensuring the attraction, retention and development of our people supports and develops individuals at all levels to grow their careers in Fircroft, as well as actively supporting company wider initiatives encouraging diversity. We look forward to continuing the work within our business to help build a more diverse, inclusive and balanced workforce. I confirm that the data reported is accurate and calculated in line with the regulations.   The data within this report is based on the UK only.
