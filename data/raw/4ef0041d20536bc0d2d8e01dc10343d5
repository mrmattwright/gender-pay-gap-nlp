With the loyal support of a team of senior staff, some of whom have been with the Company almost from day one, the Company has grown from strength to strength. Fast forward to 2017 and the same group of senior staff have been joined and supported by five hundred and seventy employees across all areas of the organisation from Food and Beverage through to Marketing, IT, Human Resources, Nursery, Health and Fitness professionals and grounds maintenance staff. Still family owned and managed we were proud to be ranked in the top 10 Gold Investors In People organisations globally in November 2017. With accolades such as this, and the drive to create a culture of equality across our organisation, we are determined to ensure that any areas of gender imbalance are addressed. The publication of our gender pay gap is just one step on this journey towards creating an inclusive culture where everyone can flourish.  Investors In People Top 10 Gold Award  The Gold Investors In People Award is an internationally recognised accreditation held by 10,000 organisations across the world. The Standard defines what it takes to lead, support and manage people well for sustainable results. These awards recognise the people and teams that make the difference every day highlighting excellence from across the Investors In People global community.  By meeting the Investors In People Gold Standard, we can be confident that we are amongst the very best in the world, when it comes to people management. The standards recognise the fostering of leadership skills at every level of the organisation to deliver outstanding results. They acknowledge that people and leaders act in line with the organisation’s values at all times. There is a culture of trust and ownership in the organisation where people feel empowered to make decisions and act on them. Recognition and reward is clear and appropriate, creating a culture of appreciation where people are motivated to perform at their best.  Ribby Hall Village Gender Pay Gap Data  The organisation has reported its gender pay gap data in line with the government’s gender pay gap reporting regulations. The gender pay gap reporting regulations require organisations with 250 or more employees to publish the difference between both the mean and median hourly rate of pay for male and female full-time employees; the difference between both the mean bonus pay and median bonus pay for male and female employees; the proportions of male and female employees who were awarded bonus pay; and the proportions of male and female full-time employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands.  When reviewing the Gender Pay Gap Data it is important to understand that this is not a measure of pay differences between individuals or groups performing the same or similar work, but a broader view of the differences in the average earnings of men and women, regardless of their role or seniority.  The median average hourly gender pay difference calculated by The Office for National Statistics put the overall pay gap for all employees in the UK in 2016 at a median of 18.1%. Ribby Hall Village can declare its overall median gender pay gap is 10.1%, almost 50% lower than the National level.  The mean gender pay gap is 18.6% for hourly fixed pay as at 5 April 2017.  The mean gender pay gap for bonuses paid in the year to 5 April 2017 is 68.4%, and the median gender pay gap for bonus pay is 12.59%. Over this period, 8.6% of men received a bonus payment, compared to 6.1% of women.  There is an even 50/50 split of employees, male to female in the upper quartile pay band at Ribby Hall Village, compared to 48.5% Male/51.5% Female in the upper middle quartile, 36% Male/ 64% Female in the lower middle quartile, and 30.7% Male/ 69.3% Female in the lower pay quartile  Ribby Hall Village remains a family business which acknowledges its growth has initially been along traditional stereotypes; the CEO taking over the Company from his father to drive its expansion and success, whilst recruiting a team of loyal individuals to support that progress. Many Ribby Hall Village employees are long standing: 69 staff currently have over 10 years’ service and 11 staff more than 20 years’ service. As the business has grown, the Company has actively sought diversity in its recruitment whilst becoming an employer of choice. Traditionally, the roles available in the food and beverage, retail and housekeeping sectors of the Company, which make up the lower pay quartile of the results, attract part time employees. The organisation attributes its success in attracting and retaining across all sectors to the practice and belief in its Vision statement “Our aim at Ribby Hall Village is to exceed the expectations of all our valued guests, clients and employees. This is fundamental in our quest for continual improvement, development, consistency and success in a safe, fun and pleasant environment”. We also pride ourselves on living the Ribby Hall Village Values:  FAMILY: We support and care for each other to create a sense of belonging  PRIDE: We are proud of each other, our work and our achievements  ENJOYMENT: We spread fun and positivity for all  PASSION: We use our drive and desire to go above and beyond  TEAMWORK: We can achieve anything together as one  INTEGRITY: We are honest and fair in all we do  Ribby Hall Village has attributed its gender pay gap to an imbalance of men and women in the lower and lower middle quartile bands of its organisational hierarchy, with typically female employees in these positions. Ribby Hall Village plans to combat gender imbalance within the organisation by a number of measures:  Addressing lower quartile rates of pay  Despite our median gender pay gap being 10.1%, almost 50% lower than the National level we committed in 2016 not only to exceeding Government minimum and living wage guidelines for 25+ but to applying these to the 21+ age group, and to continue to do so going forward; a move which will lead to the narrowing of the gender pay gaps.  We also commit to exceeding the National Minimum Wage for those aged under 21.  Addressing the Bonus structure  As is the norm in the financial set up of a family owned business, the family members and directors take their income from a balance between salary, dividend and bonuses. In March 2017 a proposal to review the payment of bonuses to management grades who were previously ineligible was agreed. The effect of this will be significant. Previously 5 men and 4 women were eligible. Under the new scheme there will be 9 men and 10 women eligible; a 150% increase in the numbers of eligible females.  Talent Management  By continuing with initiatives such as its Ethos of Excellence portfolio, which includes the Leadership, Management Excellence and Supervisor Excellence programmes, the Organisation is keen to ensure that Talent is grown and developed irrespective of gender.  The Investors In People assessment found evidence to support the Organisation’s determination to improve. Through the Management and Leadership Excellence Programmes, it can be evidenced that we are developing managers’ abilities and behaviours to ensure they can motivate their teams not only by their actions but also through competence based performance reviews, by adapting styles to suit individuals’ needs and tailoring their approach to engage with employees and inspire them to fulfil potential irrespective of gender.  This in turn allows for effective succession management. At present, 49% of our middle managers have progressed from team member level, and 64% of all middle management are female. Therefore, we would hope to see further progression of female middle managers into more senior roles.  Commitment to supporting gender profile in the community  Ribby Hall Village also continues to support and encourage Networking Groups such as Pink Link Ladies, a company dedicated to promoting female enterprise through their website, networking, events, social media and awards. We also generously contribute towards the Ladies Lunch Networking Events and their Charity Fund raising activities together with the Ladies Golf Captain dinners.  Identifying our gender pay gap is one step on the journey to creating a fully inclusive culture where everyone can flourish.
