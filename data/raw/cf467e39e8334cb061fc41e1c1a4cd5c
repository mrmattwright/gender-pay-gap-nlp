average rates of pay for our male and female employees, under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender 
Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. The “snapshot” date being 5th April 2017. 

We must analyse and report on the average rates of pay for our male and female employees, 
providing the following information on both our own website and a government website. We 
will do this within one calendar year of April 5th 2017. 

Mean Gender Pay Gap: 

Using the mean average pay, female employees are paid 12% less than male employees. 

Median Gender Pay Gap: 

Using the median average pay, female employees are paid 24% less than male employees.

Commentary: 

At  St  George’s  men  and  women  are  paid  equally  for  doing  equivalent  jobs  across  the 
organisation.  With women holding the majority of higher paid roles, our gender pay gap is 
primarily due to having far fewer men in the Lower Quartile. 

Our gender imbalance is heavily influenced by the number of part or term-time roles which  
fall largely in the lower half of the pay spectrum.  Across UK, including at St George’s, women 
applicants far  exceed  men for  such  roles.    In  many  cases  there  are  no male  applicants  for 
roles.  This is especially true of staff who work with younger children.       

St George’s Weybridge will use the Gender Pay Gap  reporting process to seek actions and 
approaches that may help to address any differential that exists at the time. 

I  can  confirm  that  the  calculations  are  an  accurate  representation  of  the  St  George’s 
Weybridge position as at 5th April 2017.
