In March 2018, we announced a gender pay profile in line with the Government’s gender pay reporting regulations and ahead of the private sector submission deadline of 4 April 2018, reporting:  A mean gender pay gap of 22.8% for fixed hourly pay;  A median gender pay gap of 17.3% for fixed hourly pay;  A reported mean gender pay gap for bonus pay of 56%;  A median gender pay gap for bonus pay of 34%.  Over the reporting period, a higher proportion of female colleagues received a bonus payment (17% vs 15%).  STV attributes its gender pay profile to the fact that a higher proportion of men are employed in senior management and leadership roles. In the upper quartile of earners, 70% are men and 30% women. Throughout the rest of the organisation, the gender split is 49% men and 51% women.  To address this we will introduce a target to achieve gender balance in the top 25% of roles by earnings within five years as well as continuing to progress a programme of measures to improve diversity and inclusion.  This includes widening the pool in recruitment activities; focusing on opportunities for accelerated career development; extending family friendly policies and further training across the organisation to raise awareness of unconscious bias.
