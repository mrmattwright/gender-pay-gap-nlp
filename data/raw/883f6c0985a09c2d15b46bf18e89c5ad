prepared in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information)
Regulations 2017.  “Park is proud to be an equal opportunities
employer.  All applications for
employment are considered on their individual merits and candidate
capabilities, and we provide training and development for all Park employees
who require it.   “Park
pays men and women the same salary for the same jobs across the business.
However, the proportion of men in senior positions is higher than that of
women. Therefore, the gap in pay that is shown in the data is due to gender
ratios at certain levels, as opposed to pay differences between men and women
undertaking the same role.  We will address the differential by reviewing
the processes by which we recruit, train, promote and support staff in their
roles.  We will also assess job specific
requirements to ascertain whether we can be more flexible in the way a job can
be performed.   To view our Gender Pay Gap Reporting figures,
