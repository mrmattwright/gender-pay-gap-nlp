We honour and respect the differences that each Amazonian brings, and we seek to include those perspectives in our solutions for our global customer base. We also seek to build the diverse community of creators and developers who we are proud to call customers.    Affinity Groups  Our Affinity Groups bring employees together across businesses and geographies. With executive and company sponsorship, these groups play an important role in building internal networks for career development, advising Amazon business units, leading in service projects, participating in policy discussions, and reaching out to communities where Amazonians live and work. Since 2016, enrollment in Amazon’s affinity groups has more than doubled in more than 90 chapters worldwide.     AmazeCon  Every year, we host AmazeCon, our largest internal conference at Amazon, to highlight the importance and business benefits of gender diversity. Over 4,700 Amazon employees participated in our 2017 conference, hearing from leading scientists, artists, and businesspeople. Megan Smith, the former Chief Technology Officer of the US Government, spoke about the history of gender representation in technology and government, and how that history informs us today. Kimberlé Crenshaw, Professor of Law at UCLA and Columbia Law School and a co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, led the Intersectional Diversity track, discussing two concepts she pioneered: critical race theory and intersectionality. Jill Soloway, a two-time Emmy winning comedian, playwright, writer, and director spoke about their experiences and the importance of holding space, leadership, and allowing for all people to make amazing things happen. There were 20 main-stage speakers and deep-dive breakout sessions on topics such as career development, technology, intersectionality, and mentoring led by internal and external leaders in their fields.    Amazon’s Military Talent initiatives in the UK and abroad  In 2017, Amazon and AWS were two of the first to sign up to the Armed Forces Covenant in the UK - a promise to ensure that those who serve or have served, and their families, are treated fairly. Early on we recognised how the skills and experiences of Service personnel, from logistics to communication would benefit our business in delivering for customers, so in 2011 we introduced our military veterans recruitment programme in the UK. Since then, we have employed almost 400 men and women into Operations management and engineering positions across our network, and many have been promoted into senior leadership positions. We’re really proud of the contribution these ex-Service personnel make every day at Amazon.  In May 2016, Amazon pledged to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021, and to train 10,000 more in cloud computing skills through AWS Educate. Amazon's Military Talent initiatives promote veteran hiring and engagement across multiple Amazon business units and geographies including the U.S., Canada, Japan, China, India, and the EU.     Diverse Creators and Builders  Through our technology we have created a set of services to help enable our diverse sellers, creators and developers to pursue their dreams. Kindle Direct Publishing has enabled over a million authors of all backgrounds to publish their books, while Amazon Marketplace enables businesses of all sizes globally to sell their products to hundreds of millions of Amazon customers. Recently, we launched the Amazon Saheli Store , which empowers women entrepreneurs in India. Read more about our customers whose lives have been transformed with Amazon.   Through Amazon Web Services, we are working to build skills in cloud computing for technical leaders from all backgrounds, and highlight the stories of diverse developers to inspire the next generation. Partnering with AWS Training and Certification and AWS Educate, We Power Tech enables diverse builders from all walks of life to innovate and shape the future of the tech industry.  In November 2017, AWS held their first We Power Tech Diversity Series. This included sessions and networking events within AWS re:Invent, a technical learning conference reaching over 43,000 attendees.     Empowering the next generation    Amazon Women in Innovation Bursary  The Amazon Women in Innovation Bursary aims to help young women from less advantaged backgrounds fulfil their ambitions of a career in innovation and technology. The bursary is awarded to six students annually in universities in cities where we have a UK Development Centre, including the University of Edinburgh, King’s College London and Churchill College at the University of Cambridge. All students are on courses that focus on high-tech innovation, including Electronic Engineering, Robotics & Intelligent Systems, and Computer Science. In addition to providing financial support the students will be mentored by a female Amazon employee who works in the software space, on careers advice, CV building, and interview training. The students will also have the opportunity to apply for an internship at the local Amazon development centre.     Amazon Early Insights Scheme  In 2017, Amazon Women in Engineering in the UK launched the Amazon Early Insights Scheme , a community outreach programme that helps young women develop new technology skills. AWE invited twelve female students in their early years of study to visit Amazon’s Development Centre in Scotland and learn how to build and develop Alexa skills. During the week, students completed a range of workshops, talks, social events and a ‘hackathon’ run by Amazon volunteers. The programme helped to build confidence in the technical skills of the participants, and encourage a career in the field of technology.    Training young people in digital skills through AWS Re:Start  AWS re:Start is a training and job placement programme, launched by Amazon Web Services in the UK, to educate 1,000 young adults, military veterans, reservists, and their spouses, on the latest software development and cloud computing technologies. The programme provides free training and job placements to help participants launch a career in technology, and is delivered in partnership with The Prince’s Trust and The Ministry of Defence.     Encouraging STEM Talent  In October 2017, Amazon committed $50M over five years to support STEM programmes for diverse communities. Part of this commitment includes $10M over the next five years to support Code.org in developing the talented technology and business leaders of tomorrow.   Code.Org and Amazon Future Engineer are working together to train future programmers.    Lesbians Who Tech  Members of our LGBT+ affinity group, glamazon, were proud to host the kick-off event for the first ever London Lesbians Who Tech Summit in 2017. Lesbians Who Tech is a community working together to promote the visibility and inclusion of women, LGBTQ people, and people from other backgrounds under-represented in technology. The Lesbians Who Tech + Allies Summit in London brought over 150 lesbians, queer women + allies across all areas of technology together at our new UK Head Office in Shoreditch, East London.  Amazon has was previously headline sponsor for the 2017 Lesbians Who Tech summit in San Francisco, with many key Amazon leaders giving inspiring and engaging talks during the event.

Latasha Gillespie, Director, Amazon’s Global Diversity & Inclusion Organisation  At Amazon, it is always Day 1. Diversity, inclusion, and equality are core values for us, and they are embedded in our DNA through our Leadership Principles : You Are Right, A Lot, when you “seek diverse perspectives, and work to disconfirm your own beliefs.” We have a lot of work to do and we are innovating in diversity, inclusion, and equality like we do in all areas of our business: using data, thinking big, and building disruptive solutions. We seek diverse builders from all walks of life to join our teams, and we encourage our employees to bring their authentic, original, and whole selves to work.    UK Gender Pay Gap and global workforce demographics  We are committed to creating a diverse organisation where employees thrive. Career progression is merit-based with a structured yearly review and 360-degree feedback, through which we enable and encourage employees to openly discuss their development and career ambitions. We take professional and personal development very seriously and have a number of groups, mentoring schemes and training programs to support employee growth at Amazon. Employees are encouraged to try out different areas and functions.  Amazon offers unique and flexible benefits to all of our employees, whether hourly or salaried, and their partners/spouses and dependents when enrolled. Examples of our benefits include private medical insurance, our parental leave programme and our transgender health benefit. Amazon’s benefits also cover transgender services, including support for employees going through gender reassignment and associated mental health services for employees and their dependents, when enrolled.  The UK Government requires all companies with 250 or more employees on 5 April 2017 to publish details of their gender pay and bonus gap. The gender pay gap is the difference in the average pay and bonuses of all men and all women across an organisation. Our Gender Pay Gap for our total UK workforce is -0.7% for median pay in favour of women compared to a UK average of 18.4% in favour of men. In 2017, 47.5% of female employees received a bonus and 45.9% of male employees received a bonus.
