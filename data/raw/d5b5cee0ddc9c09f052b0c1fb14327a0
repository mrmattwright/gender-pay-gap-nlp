As Chairman of the Board of Governors, I believe the University’s commitment to equality and diversity is reflected in our Core Values and demonstrated by our efforts towards inclusive education, student engagement, developing the knowledge and skills of staff and ultimately, successful outcomes for all of our graduates.  As a mainstream provider of higher education for individuals from the Birmingham region, we are a culturally inclusive and diverse institution that is focused on student success, underpinned by strong leadership and transformative strategies, all of which come together to assist our significant contribution to the economic, social, cultural prosperity and well-being of the city and the region.  Mark Hopton  Leadership and Governance  The Student and Engagement, Learning and Teaching (SELT) Committee receives student monitoring reports on equality and diversity produced by the Planning and Performance Department. Reports on staff equality and diversity issues are taken to the Personnel and Remuneration Committee. The Board of Governors receive an annual report on equality and diversity at one of their scheduled meetings.
