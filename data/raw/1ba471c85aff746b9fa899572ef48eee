The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men 
and women. This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings e.g. women earn 15% less than men 
per hour. 

From 2017, any organisation that has 250 or more employees is required to share some key 
information about their gender pay gap. 

Gender pay differs from “equal pay” which looks at pay differences between people carrying out the 
same or comparable work. 

Across Hargreaves Services plc and its subsidiaries (“the Group”, “Hargreaves”) we employ 
approximately 1,800 employees albeit our employees are spread over several different trading 
entities. We have three companies with employees of over 250, being Hargreaves (UK) Services 
Limited, Hargreaves Surface Mining Limited and Hargreaves Industrial Services Limited. 

The national average gender pay gap for 2016 was 18.1%, both Hargreaves Surface Mining Limited 
and Hargreaves Industrial Services Limited are below this however, Hargreaves (UK) Services 
Limited is significantly higher. 

All of these figures have been calculated according to the gender pay gap reporting regulations. 
Hourly rates include basic pay, allowances and shift premium pay, but not overtime.

The Hargreaves Industrial Services Limited gender pay gap, 5th April 2017 was 2.2%. 
 

Hargreaves Industrial Services Limited provides a range of industrial site services to the power 
generation, steel and other industrial sectors. The services engaged in are varied and include material 
handling and operations and maintenance. The company is predominantly male due to the transient 
nature of the works however, the business has a large regional head office that has a number of 
females in senior roles hence the low gender pay gap. The median gender pay gap was 12.3%.

Within this business we can see that although the male to female ratio is higher, more females than 
males receive bonuses. This is due to the upper and upper middle roles eligible for bonuses and 
having women in senior management roles within the business.

Summary 

The causes of gender pay gap are varied and overlapping. The sectors Hargreaves operates in lead to 
more  males  applying  for  positions  than  females.  However,  this  snapshot  of  data  does demonstrate 
that there are no barriers for women to progress to senior roles with eligibility to receive additional 
allowances i.e. bonuses. We hope that by publishing this information, more women will be interested 
in a future with Hargreaves. 

We are continuing to examine our gender pay gaps within our businesses and are committed to the 
Equality Act 2010. Transparency about our gender pay gap is important to us as we begin to tackle 
the root cause behind the gap. We will continue to monitor and update our facilities and sites to ensure 
they are accessible for all.
