About the report  Under new legislation all UK organisations employing 250 or more employees are required to publish their gender pay gap details each year. Read our full gender pay gap report .  At GOSH Charity we have a diverse workforce. We have strong representation of women across the organisation, including a board of trustees that is equally represented with five women and five men, and 55 per cent of the most senior roles in the charity are undertaken by women. However, the fact that more of our entry level jobs are held by women than men and that we have a greater proportion of men at director level means that our gender pay gap is not where we’d like it to be.  We are working hard to redress this. We already have a number of policies and practices in place to support women to remain at the charity and progress their careers and we are committed to build upon this work further to develop the most diverse workforce, champion gender equality and to reduce our gender pay gap.
