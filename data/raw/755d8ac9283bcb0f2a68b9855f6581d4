METROPOLITAN	POLICE	SERVICE:	GENDER	PAY	GAP	ANALYSIS	2017	

EXECUTIVE	SUMMARY	

1.  As	an	organisation	with	more	than	250	employees,	we	are	required	by	law	to	publish	our	gender	
pay	figures.		This	is	the	second	report	examining	how	our	pay	systems,	people	processes	and	
management	decisions	impact	on	average	pay	across	MPS	officers	and	staff	of	different	genders.		
Compared	to	last	year’s	analysis,	the	MPS	has	seen	a	reduction	in	our	gender	pay	gap.	The	mean	
pay	gap	for	police	officers	has	reduced	from	7.32%	in	2016	to	3.36%	in	2017.		We	have	also	seen	
reductions	for	police	staff,	12.51%	in	2016	to	10.93%	in	2017	and	for	PCSOs	1.98%	in	2016	to	
0.89%	in	2017.			
	
It	is	important	to	stress	that	police	officer	and	police	staff	pay	is	determined	in	accordance	with	
roles,	with	no	reference	to	gender.		Female	and	male	officers	and	staff	who	undertake	the	same	
role,	have	the	same	length	of	service	and	work	the	same	hours	thereby	receive	the	same	pay.		
Nevertheless,	when	considering	average	pay	across	the	workforce,	differences	are	apparent.	

2. 

3.  This	analysis	highlights	that	many	different	factors	impact	on	gender	related	pay.		These	include:	

	

	

•  Historical	 allowances.	 	 Although	 withdrawn	 for	 new	 joiners,	 some	 allowances	 continue	 to	
impact	 on	 longer	 serving	 officers	 and	 staff.	 For	 example,	 these	 include	 housing	 and	 rent	
allowance	for	police	officers	and	service	related	pay	for	police	staff	and	PCSOs	which	due	to	
historical	structures	were	more	likely	to	be	taken	by	men	than	women.	

•  Unsocial	 hours	 payments	 and	 part-time	 working.	 	 More	 men	 work	 unsocial	 hours	 and	
thereby	 receive	 related	 additional	 pay.	 This	 additional	 remuneration	 inflates	 the	 apparent	
difference	in	pay	between	men	and	women	in	the	MPS.		Furthermore,	more	women	than	
men	 work	 part-time	 which	 again	 affects	 the	 difference	 in	 overall	 pay	 between	 men	 and	
women.		

•  Other	complicating	factors.		The	annual	career	progression	of	both	police	officers	and	police	
staff	 mean	 advancing	 from	 the	 bottom	 to	 the	 top	 can	 take	 many	 years	 and	 pay	 is	
determined	by	time	served.		The	analysis	shows	that	women	are	more	likely	to	take	unpaid	
career	breaks	than	men	which	means	for	some	their	career	progression	is	slower.				
	

4.  Our	 recruiting	 policies	 are	 growing	 a	 workforce	 that	 ‘looks	 and	 feels	 like	 London’.	 	 As	 our	
recruitment	 strategy	 attracts	 a	 more	 diverse	 workforce	 this,	 too,	 can	 initially	 have	 a	 negative	
impact	 on	 our	 pay	 gap	 as	 newly	 recruited	 women	 take	 time	 to	 gain	 annual	 increments	 and	
gravitate	towards	the	top	of	pay	spines.		We	are	also	working	to	ensure	balanced	representation	
at	all	ranks	and	grades.	

5.  The	MPS	will	continue	to	be	proactive	in	addressing	any	pay	differences	that	are	found	to	be	
underpinned	 by	 unfairness.	 As	 noted	 in	 the	 report,	 a	 range	 of	 factors	 influence	 average	 pay	
differences,	many	reflecting	genuine	operational	factors.	The	MPS	will	engage	with	the	Police	
Remuneration	Review	Body	and	police	staff	trade	unions	to	ensure	that	our	pay	and	workforce	
policies	remain	fair	and	transparent.	

6.  This	analysis	will	be	updated	on	an	annual	basis	so	that	we	can	continue	to	track	progress,	as	
required	 by	 the	 law.	 Whilst	 average	 pay	 gaps	 in	 the	 MPS	 are	 lower	 than	 seen	 across	 the	
economy	as	a	whole,	we	are	not	complacent	and	we	will	address	any	issues	where	we	find	that	
our	pay	or	workforce	policies	have	a	discriminatory	impact.

ABOUT	THE	AUDIT	
	
7.  The	Gender	Pay	Gap	Regulations	2017	requires	all	public	bodies	to	report	on	their	gender	pay	
gap	 by	 31	 March	 2018.	 	 According	 to	 Regulations,	 any	 UK	 organisation	 that	 has	 250	 or	 more	
employees	must	publish	and	report	specific	figures	about	their	gender	pay	gap:	

•  Mean	gender	pay	gap	in	hourly	pay	
•  Median	gender	pay	gap	in	hourly	pay	
•  Mean	bonus	gender	pay	gap	
•  Median	bonus	gender	pay	gap	
•  Proportion	of	males	and	females	receiving	a	bonus	payment	
•  Proportion	of	males	and	females	in	each	pay	quartile.	

	
8.  The	 Mayor’s	 manifesto	 contained	 a	 commitment	 to	 publish	 a	 gender	 pay	 gap	 for	 the	
Metropolitan	Police	Service	(MPS)	with	a	requirement	that	work	is	undertaken	to	narrow	any	
gaps	that	emerge	from	the	analysis.			

	

	

	
9.  The	data	in	this	document	represents	the	gender	pay	gap	data	for	the	MPS	as	at	31	March	2017	
and	 includes	 all	 payments	 made	 to	 MPS	 officers	 and	 staff.	 	 This	 includes	 all	 remuneration	
including	base	pay,	location	allowance,	shift	premium,	bonus	pay	and	any	other	pay.		The	data	
has	 been	 broken	 down	 by	 both	 full-time	 and	 part-time	 staff	 and	 also	 by	 the	 different	
occupational	groups.			

	
10. Due	to	changes	to	draft	Gender	Pay	Gap	Regulations	in	2016	and	final	regulations	in	2017,	it	is	
difficult	 to	 directly	 compare	 the	 2017	 figures	 with	 those	 from	 2016.	 	 In	 2016,	 anyone	 on	
Maternity	 Pay	 or	 Paternity	 Pay	 during	 the	 snapshot	 were	 included.	 	 In	 2017,	 the	 regulations	
exclude	these	individuals.		The	impact	on	the	calculations	makes	it	hard	to	directly	compare	the	
two	figures.	

	
ABOUT	THE	MPS	-	POLICE	OFFICERS	AND	POLICE	STAFF	
	
11. The	 MPS	 consists	 of	 two	 distinct	 groups	 of	 employees	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 this	 audit;	 police	
officers	and	police	staff	(the	latter	includes	Police	Support	Community	Officers	(PCSOs)).	Each	
group’s	employment	has	separate	Terms	and	Conditions,	outlined	below.		Pay	progression	for	
both	 officers	 and	 staff	 is	 through	 annual	 increments	 on	 the	 anniversary	 of	 appointment	 or	
promotion	until	the	maximum	for	the	rank	or	grade	is	reached.		Any	periods	off	pay	(with	the	
exception	 of	 maternity	 and	 parental	 leave)	 do	 not	 count	 towards	 incremental	 progression	 for	
either	officers	or	staff.	

•  Police	Officers.		Officers	make	up	71%	of	the	workforce.		Their	terms	and	conditions	are	set	
nationally	 by	 the	 Government	 based	 on	 recommendations	 from	 the	 independent	 Police	
Remuneration	Review	Body	(PRRB)	and	are	bound	by	Police	Regulations.		Salary	ranges	are	
determined	 in	 accordance	 with	 rank	 and	 length	 of	 service	 with	 no	 reference	 to	 gender,	
ethnicity	or	any	other	protected	characteristics.	
	

•  Police	Staff.		Police	Staff	consist	of	uniformed	and	non-uniformed	support	staff.		Their	terms	

and	conditions	are	negotiated	by	the	MPS	in	partnership	with	recognised	trade	unions.			
	

o  Police	 Community	 Support	 Officers	 (PCSO).	 	 PCSOs	 are	 operational,	 uniformed	
police	 staff.	 	 They	 make	 up	 3%	 of	 the	 Workforce.	 	 There	 is	 a	 single	 pay	 range	 for	

	

2	

	

PCSOs;	all	staff	will	earn	a	salary	between	the	minimum	and	maximum	of	the	salary	
range.	 	 The	 salary	 range	 makes	 no	 reference	 to	 gender,	 ethnicity	 or	 any	 other	
protected	characteristics.	

o  Police	 staff.	 	 Police	 staff	 consist	 of	 uniformed	 (Dedicated	 Detention	 Officers	 and	
Communications	 Officers)	 and	 non-uniformed	 staff	 and	 make	 up	 20%	 of	 the	
workforce.	 Salary	 ranges	 are	 determined	 through	 an	
job	
evaluation	 scheme	 with	 no	 reference	 to	 gender,	 ethnicity	 or	 any	 other	 protected	
characteristics.		Job	evaluation	is	a	systematic	way	of	comparing	different	jobs	in	an	
organisation	to	establish	their	relative	worth	and	position	on	pay	scales.		Length	of	
service	is	a	factor	in	pay	due	to	incremental	pay	scales.	

industry	 standard	

	
Note:		The	remaining	6%	of	the	workforce	are	Metropolitan	Special	Constables	(MSCs)	(volunteer	
police	officers)	who	have	not	been	included	as	they	are	not	employees	and	there	is	no	requirement	
to	include	them	in	the	analysis.	
	
OVERALL	STATISTICS	
	
12. For	 the	 purpose	 of	 this	 report,	 there	 are	 40,445	 relevant	 employees.	 	 13,347	 are	 listed	 as	

female.		The	13,347	female	employees	make	up	33%	of	the	total	MPS	workforce.			

HOW	WE	HAVE	CALCULATED	THE	DATA	

13. In	order	to	understand	the	gender	pay	gap,	the	data	has	been	broken	down	by	various	employee	
characteristics	such	as	age,	length	of	service,	hours	worked	and	various	elements	of	pay.		The	
report	is	divided	into	the	two	main	occupational	groups;	Police	Officers	and	Police	Staff	(latter	
including	PCSOs)	and	an	in-depth	analysis	compares	the	two	categories	as	well	as	key	employee	
characteristics	within	each	group.		The	gender	pay	gap	has	been	calculated	using	the	mean	and	
median	as	follows:	

•  The	Mean	is	the	difference	between	the	average	gross	hourly	earnings	of	male	and	female	

expressed	as	a	percentage	of	the	average	gross	hourly	earnings	of	male	employees.	

	

	

•  The	Median	is	the	value	separating	the	higher	half	of	data	from	the	lower	half.		In	simple	
terms,	it	may	be	thoughts	of	as	the	‘middle’	value	of	the	data	set.		The	basic	advantage	of	
the	median	in	describing	data	compared	to	the	mean	is	that	it	is	not	skewed	so	much	by	
extremely	large	or	small	values,	and	so	it	may	give	a	more	‘typical’	value.	
	

14. A	 key	 indicator	 for	 the	 gender	 pay	 gap	 is	 the	 composition	 of	 the	 workforce	 by	 separate	 pay	
quartiles.		To	create	the	quartiles,	the	pay	data	is	arranged	in	ascending	order	from	the	lowest	to	
the	highest	salary	and	the	data	is	divided	into	four	equal	groups;	Lower	Quartile,	Lower	Middle	
Quartile,	Upper	Middle	Quartile,	Upper	Quartile.	

	
SUMMARY	FINDINGS	
	
15. The	MPS	publishes	a	significant	amount	of	workforce	data	that	is	available	through	the	Mayor’s	
Office	for	Policing	and	Crime	(MOPAC)	dashboard.		This	supporting	data	is	captured	in	the	tables	
below	this	summary.	

	
16. The	MPS’	gender	pay	gap	analysis	overall	shows	the	following	information:	
	

Police	Officers

• 

Female	 police	 officers	 employed	 by	 the	 MPS	 receive	 on	 average	 £0.71	 less	 per	 hour	 than	
their	male	counterparts.		This	equates	to	a	mean	pay	gap	of	3.36%.		By	using	the	median	as	
a	measure,	female	police	officers	employed	by	the	MPS	receive	on	average	£0.15	less	per	
hour	than	their	male	counterparts.		This	equates	to	a	median	pay	gap	of	0.70%.	

Police	Staff	

• 

Female	police	staff	employed	by	the	MPS	receive	on	average	£2.18	less	per	hour	than	their	
male	counterparts.		This	equates	to	a	mean	pay	gap	of	10.93%.		By	using	the	median	as	a	
measure,	female	police	staff	employed	by	the	MPS	receive	on	average	£1.23	less	per	hour	
than	their	male	counterparts.		This	equates	to	a	median	pay	gap	of	6.85%.	
	

PCSOs	

• 

Female	PCSOs	employed	by	the	MPS	receive	on	average	£0.14	less	per	hour	than	their	male	
counterparts.		This	equates	to	a	mean	pay	gap	of	0.89%.		By	using	the	median	as	a	measure,	
female	PCSOs	employed	by	the	MPS	receive	on	average	£0.44	less	per	hour	than	their	male	
counterparts.		This	equates	to	a	median	pay	gap	of	2.69%.

20. The	MPS	pays	a	number	of	bonus	payments.		For	those	who	have	excelled	in	the	performance	of	
their	duty,	a	bonus,	normally	to	a	maximum	of	£500	is	awarded.		Lump	sum	payments	are	issued	
for	retention	initiatives.			The	number	of	MPS	police	officers	receiving	a	bonus	payment	is	0.36%	
(112	officers).			
	

21. The	 number	 of	 male	 officers	 receiving	 a	 bonus	 payment	 is	 0.38%	 (86	 officers)	 compared	 to

Table	6:		Quartiles	for	MPS	police	officers		

	

23. Looking	at	the	quartile	distribution,	it	can	be	seen	that	there	is	a	higher	concentration	of	female	
officers	in	the	lower	and	middle	quartiles.		Looking	at	the	pay	gap	by	quartile	distribution	for	
police	officers	shows	that	the	pay	gap	is	highest	in	the	lower	and	lower	middle	quartiles.		This	is	
due	 to	 the	 constable	 rank	 having	 the	 longest	 pay	 scale,	 progressed	 via	 annual	 increments.		
Female	officers	having	a	slightly	lower	average	length	of	service	in	comparison	to	male	officers	
at	the	Constable	rank.		Figures	from	November	2017	showed	3,844	out	of	a	population	of	7,985	
female	officers	(51.9%)	reached	the	top	time-served	pay	points	compared	to	9,839	out	of	17,456	
male	officers	(56.36%).			

	
24. Female	police	officers	are	also	statistically	more	likely	to	take	a	longer	period	to	reach	the	top	of	
the	 pay	 scale	 due	 to	 the	 impact	 of	 time	 away	 from	 work.	 	 Paragraph	 11	 confirmed	 that	 any	
periods	 off	 pay	 (with	 the	 exception	 of	 maternity	 and	 parental	 leave)	 do	 not	 count	 towards	

	

7	

incremental	 progression	 for	 either	 officers	 or	 staff.	 	 In	 the	 MPS,	 3.62%	 of	 the	 female	 police	
officer	population	is	on	an	unpaid	career	break	compared	to	1.7%	of	the	total	population.	

25. Worked	hours	also	has	an	impact	on	the	mean	pay	gap.		Women	are	over	3	times	more	likely	to	
be	working	part-time	than	men.		Only	5%	of	the	total	number	of	police	officers	in	the	MPS	work	
part	time.		From	this	5%	figure,	women	represent	88%	of	the	total	part	time	population.			

	

Table	7:		Worked	Hours	for	MPS	police	officers	

Analysis	by	age	
	
26. The	 average	 age	 for	 male	 officers	 in	 the	 MPS	 is	39.08	 years	 and	 for	 female	 officers	 is	 slightly	
lower	 at	 37.38	 years.	 	 	 Looking	 at	 the	 workforce	 composition	 by	 age,	 the	 number	 of	 police	
officers	 starts	 low	 for	 the	 under	 20	 years	 age	 category,	 increases	 rapidly	 for	 the	 30	 –	 40	 age	
category	before	evening	out	for	40	–	50	and	then	dropping	for	50+.	

	

Table	8:		Age	Profile	for	MPS	police	officers

Length	of	Service	
27. On	average	female	officers	earn	slightly	less	as	a	group	(in	the	constable	rank	in	particular)	since	
a	slightly	higher	proportion	of	female	constables	are	currently	on	lower	pay	points	in	this	scale.		
This	 is	 primarily	 due	 to	 them	 having	 slightly	 less	 time	 in	 service	 on	 average	 than	 their	 male	
colleagues.		The	average	length	of	service	for	male	officers	is	13.21	years,	whereas	for	female	
officers	it	is	11.64	years.				
	

28. Length	of	service	also	influences	base	pay	rates	in	respect	of	the	position	on	pay	scales.		It	takes	
7	years	to	reach	the	top	of	the	Police	Constable	pay	scale.		This	has	a	slight	impact	on	the	gender	
pay,	with	over	56%	of	male	police	constables	(9,839	out	of	17,456	officers)	having	completed	
sufficient	service	to	reach	the	top	of	their	pay	rank	compared	to	under	52%	of	female	officers	
(3,844	out	of	7,406	officers).		This	evidence	is	detailed	in	the	section	on	incremental	pay	scales	
at	Paragraph	34.		The	difference	in	pay	for	a	Constable	with	7	years’	service	compared	to	a	new	
probationer	is	£15k.		The	salary	range	for	Constables	appointed	to	the	MPS	after	1	April	2013	is	
shown	in	Table	11.			

29. In	terms	of	the	workforce,	length	of	service	is	mirrored	for	both	men	and	women	and	increases	
up	 until	 10	 –	 20	 years	 and	 then	 drops	 for	 over	 twenty	 years	 of	 service	 as	 shown	 in	 the	 table	
below,	largely	reflecting	historic	recruitment	patterns.	

	

	

	

Table	9:		Length	of	Service	for	MPS	police	officers

30. The	gender	pay	gap	is	highest	for	those	with	20	or	more	years	of	service	(mean	1.6%,	median	
3.95%).		It	is	also	least	for	those	between	1	–	3	years	of	service	(mean	-0.34%	and	median	0.14%)	
as	shown	in	the	table	below.		This	is	not	caused	directly	by	length	of	service	as	this	does	not	
impact	 pay	 once	 officers	 reach	 the	 top	 of	 the	 scale.	 It	 is	 most	 likely	 a	 reflection	 of	 decisions	
around	 working	 time	 (full	 and	 part	 time)	 and	 lower	 levels	 of	 female	 representation	 in	 more	
senior	ranks.

31. The	 average	 hourly	 rates	 of	 pay	 are	 highest	 for	 those	 officers	 with	 over	 ten	 years	 of	 service,	
reflecting	the	reality	that	more	officers	with	this	length	of	service	will	have	secured	promotion	
than	 those	 with	 less	 than	 10	 years’	 service.	 	 Female	 officers	 currently	 make	 up	 a	 lower	
proportion	of	senior	ranks	than	junior	ranks.			
	

	

Recruitment	

32. Table	12	below	shows	that	in	the	10-year	period	from	31	March	2007	to	31	March	2017,	the	
MPS	has	recruited	an	additional	1,700	female	police	officers.		This	is	just	under	a	21%	increase	in	
the	overall	number	of	female	police	officers.		Our	recruitment	strategy	is	achieving	an	increase	
in	diversity,	albeit	not	as	strong	as	our	ambition.		The	MPS	gender	pay	gap	is	impacted	by	female	
police	 officers	 having	 less	 service	 on	 average	 than	 their	 male	 counterparts.	 	 This	 is	 due	 to	 a	
number	of	factors;	in	part	the	impact	of	the	7-year	constable	pay	scale,	but	more	significantly	
that	length	of	service	partly	influences	the	likelihood	of	progression	through	the	formal	police	
rank	structure.

Historic	Allowances	–	Rent/Housing	Allowance	

	

13	

36. Historic	 allowances	 such	 as	 the	 rent/housing	 allowance	 are	 more	 likely	 to	 be	 paid	 to	 a	 larger	
proportion	of	male	police	officers	than	female	police	officers	due	to	the	recruitment	profile	at	
the	 time	 such	 allowances	 were	 awarded.	 	 All	 police	 officers	 who	 joined	 the	 MPS	 before	 1	
September	 1994	 were	 entitled	 to	 receive	 the	 payment	 of	 a	 rent/housing	 allowance	 or	 were	
given	 rent-free	 police	 accommodation.	 	 However,	 from	 1	 September,	 the	 rent/housing	
allowance	was	withdrawn	for	all	new	starters.	

	
37. Currently,	there	are	4,492	police	officers	in	receipt	of	the	historic	housing	allowance.		Of	these,	
3,526	 are	 male	 (15.7%	 of	 male	 police	 officers)	 and	 966	 are	 female	 (12%	 of	 female	 police	
officers).

38. The	numbers	show	that	as	a	mean,	women	who	are	also	entitled	to	this	allowance	receive	a	
lower	rate	than	men.		The	main	reason	why	Female	Police	Officers	receive	less	Rent/Housing	
Allowance	than	their	male	counterparts	is	because	there	are	more	female	police	officers	at	
Constable	rank.		Rates	of	Rent/Housing	Allowance	vary	according	to	rank	and	a	higher	ratio	
of	women	receive	this	allowance	as	Constables	compared	to	any	other	rank.		As	a	result,	
there	is	a	higher	proportion	of	women	on	a	lower	allowance,	which	effectively	decreases	the	
overall	mean	Rent/Housing	Allowance	that	Female	police	officers	receive.	

39. The	mean	difference	in	the	overall	hourly	rate	of	pay	for	police	officers	is	£0.70	per	hour	
(see	Table	1).		£0.16	(23%)	of	the	difference	in	Male	and	Female	police	officers	mean	hourly	
pay	is	due	to	Rent/Housing	Allowance.		If	Rent/Housing	Allowance	was	ignored,	the	mean	
pay	gap	for	police	officers	would	reduce	their	gap	from	3.36%	to	2.91%	
	

Current	Allowances	

40. Unsocial	Hours.		All	police	officers	at	the	rank	of	Constable	up	to	and	including	Chief	Inspectors	
are	entitled	to	receive	an	additional	unsocial	hour’s	payment	to	compensate	them	when	they	
work	between	the	hours	of	20:00	–	06:00.		This	payment	is	calculated	on	an	hourly	basis	as	10%	
of	basic	pay	(so	the	disparity	in	average	pay	due	to	length	of	service	and	the	7-year	constable	
pay	scale	also	affects	the	size	of	this	pay	element).						

	
41. Currently,	there	are	18,180	police	officers	in	receipt	of	the	Unsocial	Hours	allowance.		Of	these,	
18,180	 are	 male	 (81%	 of	 male	 police	 officers)	 and	 5,598	 are	 female	 (70%	 of	 female	 police	
officers).			This	report	showed	that	female	police	officers	receive	on	average	23.73%	(mean)	less	
unsocial	hours	pay	than	male	officers.		This	represents	an	improvement	compared	to	last	year’s	
figure	of	31%.	
	

42. Table	18	below	shows	the	mean	and	median	unsocial	hour’s	payments	paid	to	female	and	male	

officers.

43. The	 MPS	 has	 been	 able	 to	 use	 the	 dataset	 to	 further	 analyse	 the	 profile	 by	 age	 in	 order	 to	
contextualise	the	gap.		Looking	at	the	age	profile	of	those	in	receipt	of	unsocial	hours	allowance	
compared	to	the	overall	age	profile	of	the	MPS,	women	under	20	are	the	group	that	utilise	the	
allowance	the	most.		This	is	due	to	the	fact	that	new	operational	police	officers	are	expected	to	
work	shifts.	
	

44. After	20-30,	it	drops	considerably	and	more	so	for	women	than	men.		This	indicates	that	fewer	
female	 officers	 employed	 in	 the	 MPS	 are	 in	 roles	 where	 the	 unsociable	 hours	 payment	 is	
applicable	 (which	 may	 in	 turn	 be	 linked	 to	 a	 higher	 proportion	 of	 female	 officers	 being	 the	
primary	 carers	 for	 their	 dependents).	 	 The	 graph	 below	 shows	 that	 women	 choosing	 to	 work	
unsocial	hours	have	the	greatest	drop	(90%	to	69%)	in	paid	hours	from	aged	30	upwards.			

	
45. Statistics	show	that	over	87%	of	police	officers	that	work	part	time	in	the	MPS	are	female.		In	
addition,	3.62%	of	the	total	female	police	officer	population	is	on	a	career	break	compared	to	
just	1.7%	of	the	total	police	strength.

Context	for	MPS’	pay	gap	for	Police	Staff	

50. The	MPS	has	analysed	the	gender	pay	gap	for	police	staff	to	understand	what	the	root	causes	

are.	These	are	discussed	below.	

	
Bonus	Pay	
	
51. The	MPS	pays	a	number	of	bonus	payments	for	those	who	have	excelled	in	the	performance	of	
their	 duty	 (normally	 to	 a	 maximum	 of	 £500)	 or	 lump	 sum	 payments	 for	 retention	 initiatives.			
The	number	of	MPS	police	staff	receiving	a	bonus	payment	is	2.74%	(233	staff).			
	

52. The	number	of	male	staff	receiving	a	bonus	payment	is	2.71%	(99	staff)	compared	to	2.76%	(134	

staff)	of	female	officers.		The	mean	bonus	pay	gap	is	-10.96%	with	a	0%	median	bonus	pay	gap.

54. The	 quartile	 distribution	 indicates	 that	 the	 higher	 mean	 pay	 gap	 is	 created	 by	 the	 higher	
concentration	 of	 female	 staff	 in	 the	 lower	 quartiles.	 	 67%	 of	 police	 staff	 in	 non-managerial	
positions	in	the	MPS	are	female.		There	is	also	a	large	gap	in	the	upper	quartiles.		This	is	caused	
by	only	33%	of	staff	being	female	in	the	two	most	senior	grades	(Broad	Bands	and	Band	A).	
	

55. 	The	quartile	distribution	for	police	staff	shows	that	the	pay	gap	is	highest	in	the	lower	quartile.		
This	 is	 due	 to	 historical	 allowances	 such	 as	 Service	 Related	 Pay	 (SRP)	 and	 current	 allowances	
such	as	Shift	Disturbance	Allowance	and	Premium	Pay,	which	have	a	significant	impact	within	
the	MPS	pay	system.	Any	differences	between	roles	/	working	patterns	of	male	and	female	staff	
which	impact	their	entitlement	to	these	additional	payments	will	result	in	a	difference	between	
overall	average	pay.		

56. For	PCSOs	a	more	balanced	recruitment	throughout	the	period	this	rank	has	existed	has	resulted	
in	 a	 smaller	 pay	 gap	 in	 both	 mean	 and	 median	 hourly	 pay.	 	 This	 means	 length	 of	 service	
promotion	issues	have	very	little	impact	on	this	small	group	compared	to	the	other	groups.		

	

	

	

21	

	

57. Female	police	staff	are	also	statistically	more	likely	to	take	a	longer	period	to	reach	the	top	of	
the	 pay	 scale	 due	 to	 the	 impact	 of	 time	 away	 from	 work.	 	 Paragraph	 11	 confirmed	 that	 any	
periods	 off	 pay	 (with	 the	 exception	 of	 maternity	 and	 parental	 leave)	 do	 not	 count	 towards	
incremental	progression	for	either	officers	or	staff.		In	the	MPS,	2.50%	of	the	female	police	staff	
population	is	on	an	unpaid	career	break	compared	to	1.70%	of	the	total	population.	For	PCSOs,	
the	percentage	is	even	higher	at	4.32%	compared	to	2.33%	of	the	total	population.	

	
58. Furthermore,	 women	 are	 over	 3	 times	 more	 likely	 to	 be	 working	 part-time	 than	 men.	 	 In	 the	
MPS,	over	88%	of	part	time	police	staff	are	female.		For	PCSOs,	the	percentage	is	slightly	lower	
at	75%.

59. The	average	age	for	male	staff	in	the	MPS	is	45.68	years	and	for	female	staff	is	only	very	slightly	
lower	at	44.64	years.			Looking	at	the	workforce	composition	by	age,	the	number	of	police	staff	
starts	low	for	the	under	20-age	category	and	increases	rapidly	for	the	30	–	40	age	categories	
before	evening	out	for	40	–	50	and	50+.	
	

60. The	average	age	for	male	PCSOs	in	the	MPS	is	45.09	years	and	for	female	PCSOs	is	slightly	lower	
at	43.78	years.			Looking	at	the	workforce	composition	by	age,	the	number	of	male	and	female	
PCSOs	 is	 almost	 on	 par	 for	 the	 20-30	 age	 category.	 	 However,	 in	 the	 30-40	 age	 group,	 the	
increase	for	men	almost	doubles	compared	to	the	women.		Beyond	this	in	the	40-50	and	50+	
age	group	the	difference	between	men	and	women	stays	at	the	same	rate.		As	the	PCSO	role	is	
new	 (compared	 to	 other	 employee	 categories),	 the	 age	 profile	 difference	 is	 due	 to	 the	 MPS	
recruiting	men	who	tended	to	be	slightly	older	than	their	female	counterparts	during	the	initial	
recruitment	campaigns.			

Table	33:		Age	Profile	for	MPS	Police	Staff	

Table	34:		Age	Profile	for	MPS	PCSOs

61. The	gender	pay	gap	mostly	reflects	the	workforce	composition;	it	is	low	for	under	20	years	and	
the	30	-	40	age	group	but	increases	for	40	–	50	and	50+	age	categories.		It	is	as	high	as	16.81%	
for	 the	 mean	 on	 50+	 group.	 	 Whilst	 this	 is	 in	 line	 with	 national	 trends,	 it	 may	 indicate	 that	
women	in	support	roles	see	slower	career	progression.	
	

Length	of	Service		
	
62. The	 average	 length	 of	 service	 for	 female	 police	 staff	 is	 slightly	 higher	 than	 male	 police	 staff	
(15.66	years	compared	to	15.63	years).		For	PCSOs,	female	staff	tend	to	have	slightly	less	length	
of	service	than	male	staff	(11.06	years	compared	to	11.33	years).	
	

63. The	 gender	 pay	 gap	 is	 higher	 (mean	 13.61%)	 for	 those	 police	 staff	 with	 under	 one	 year’s	 of	
service,	 reflecting	 recent	 recruitment	 at	 senior	 grades	 which	 has	 seen	 more	 men	 recruited	
directly	to	senior	positions	than	women.	
	

64. The	gender	pay	gap	then	drops	to	its	lowest	for	1	–	3	years	of	service	but	then	continues	to	rise	
until	it	reaches	its	peak	at	over	20	years	of	service	(15.82%	mean	and	15.29%	median).		This	is	in	
line	with	national	data	that	shows	that	the	gender	pay	gap	starts	for	women	in	their	thirties	and	
continues	to	grow.		Research	shows	that	this	may	be	due	to	the	impact	of	career	breaks	taken	by	
women	and	a	consequential	slower	career	progression	towards	senior	roles.

Incremental	pay	

	

66. Table	37	below	shows	how	incremental	pay	influences	the	gender	pay	gap.		Incremental	pay	has	
an	impact	on	police	staff	pay	primarily	due	to	female	staff	taking	longer	to	reach	the	top	of	the	
pay	steps.		Female	staff	tend	to	take	more	periods	off	pay	(with	the	exception	of	maternity	and	
parental	 leave)	 and	 these	 periods	 do	 not	 count	 towards	 incremental	 progression	 for	 either	
officers	or	staff.

Historical	Allowance	-	Service	Related	Pay	(SRP)	
67. An	 example	 of	 a	 historical	 allowance,	 which	 affects	 gender	 pay,	 is	 the	 service	 related	
supplementary	 payments	 made	 to	 police	 staff	 and	 PCSOs.	 	 The	 SRP	 allowance	 was	 frozen	 in	
2015	and	new	entrants	barred	from	accessing	the	payment	due	to	the	negative	impact	it	had	on	
ethnicity	 and	 gender	 pay.	 	 Previously,	 staff	 qualified	 for	 SRP	 when	 they	 completed	 9	 years’	
service	and	then	again	for	an	additional	payment	when	they	completed	15	years’	service.			

68. Staff	 that	 took	 career	 breaks/unpaid	 leave	 took	 longer	 to	 reach	 the	 necessary	 service	 to	 be	
eligible	 to	 receive	 this	 payment.	 	 Out	 of	 a	 total	 of	 8,493	 employees	 (police	 staff	 and	 PCSOs),	
6,885	receive	service	related	pay	-	3,911	women	and	2,972	men.		The	table	below	shows	the	
mean	 and	 median	 amounts	 paid	 to	 female	 and	 male	 staff.	 	 The	 figures	 show	 that	 male	 staff	
receive	a	higher	mean	rate	than	female	staff.		The	difference	in	amount	is	predominately	caused	
by	part	time	staff	receiving	a	pro-rata	allowance;	this	impacts	more	on	female	officers	than	men	
(88%	of	part-time	staff	are	female).

Current	allowance	-	Shift	Disturbance	Allowance		

69. Some	 police	 staff	 and	 PCSOs	 are	 entitled	 to	 receive	 a	 Shift	 Disturbance	 Allowance	 to	
compensate	them	for	variations	in	their	working	hours.		This	allowance	has	differing	rates	(set	at	
20%,	15%	and	12.5%	of	base	pay)	depending	on	the	shift,	the	number	of	hours	worked	and	the	
rate	of	pay	earned	by	the	employee.		A	total	of	4,736	of	MPS	staff	receive	the	allowance	because	
they	work	in	roles	that	require	them	to	perform	unsociable	hours.		Of	the	4,736	who	received	
the	allowance,	44%	were	female	staff	compared	to	56%	of	male	staff	(i.e.,	a	higher	proportion	of	
men	than	women	undertake	roles	qualifying	for	these	extra	payments).	

	

	

26	

70. Because	 a	 higher	 proportion	 of	 are	 in	 qualifying	 roles,	 female	 police	 staff	 overall	 receive	 on	
average	 3.97%	 (mean)	 and	 7.60%	 (median)	 less	 shift	 disturbance	 allowance	 than	 their	 male	
colleagues	overall.		Table	40	shows	that	the	number	of	women	working	shifts	has	the	greatest	
drop	from	aged	30	upwards.	

Table	40:		Age	Profile	of	Police	Staff	receiving	a	Shift	Disturbance	Allowance	

	

Current	allowance	–	Location	Allowance	
71. Police	 staff	 and	 PCSOs	 receive	 a	 location	 allowance	 that	 is	 intended	 to	 compensate	 for	 the	
increase	cost	of	travelling	into	central	London.		Location	allowance	is	paid	based	on	where	an	
individual	works	within	two	given	zones.		Staff	receive	£3,406	for	working	in	Zone	1	or	£1,807	for	
working	in	Zone	2.	

	
72. Out	of	a	total	of	9,979	employees	(police	staff	and	PCSOs),	9,876	receive	the	location	allowance.		
This	year’s	gender	pay	gap	report	shows	that	female	police	staff	and	PCSOs	receive	on	average	
9.69%	(mean)	and	11.1%	(median)	less	location	allowance	than	their	male	colleagues.		This	is	
caused	by	two	factors:			

	

•  A	higher	proportion	of	male	staff	work	in	central	London	and	thereby	qualify	for	the	higher	

allowance	linked	to	higher	costs.	

•  A	higher	proportion	of	female	workers	work	part	time	hours.

73. The	impact	of	working	hours	can	be	seen	by	breaking	this	down	further	by	full	time	and	part	
time	staff.		The	difference	between	men	and	women	working	full	time	is	much	smaller.		For	part-
time	staff,	the	difference	is	greater	as	female	staff	tend	to	work	in	locations	closer	to	their	home	
address.		The	table	below	shows	the	impact.

Current	allowance	-	Premium	Payments	
74. Premium	Pay	can	be	claimed	by	police	staff,	with	a	contractual	entitlement,	if	hours	are	worked	
on	 a	 weekend	 or	 public	 holiday.	 	 2,209	 staff	 received	 Premium	 Pay	 during	 the	 snapshot-
reporting	month.		1,208	were	women	(55%)	compared	to	1,001	men	(45%)	–	broadly	equivalent	
to	 their	 overall	 proportion	 across	 the	 workforce.	 	 However,	 on	 average	 woman	 received	 less	
Premium	Pay	than	men.			

	
75. The	 snapshot	 report	 showed	 that	 female	 police	 staff	 receive	 on	 average	 13.6%	 (mean)	 and	
15.6%	(median)	less	Premium	Pay	than	their	male	colleagues.		The	job	level	profile	of	employees	
who	receive	Premium	Pay	indicate	that	the	higher	pay	bands	are	male	dominated	whereas	the	
lower	pay	bands	are	more	heavily	female	dominated.		As	Premium	Payments	are	linked	to	base	
salary,	 this	 will	 result	 in	 higher	 mean	 and	 median	 average	 payments	 to	 male	 employees	 at	
present.

Current	allowance	-	Flexibility	Allowance	
77. Some	groups	of	police	staff	are	entitled	to	receive	a	flexibility	allowance.		273	female	police	staff	
and	270	male	police	staff	receive	this	allowance.		The	allowance	is	predominantly	paid	to	police	
staff	that	work	as	999	Call	Handlers	and	is	given	in	lieu	of	Premium	Payments.		The	only	other	
two	 groups	 that	 receive	 the	 allowance	 are	 drivers	 and	 Specialist	 Technical	 Staff,	 who	 are	
predominately	male.	 	 Each	 group	 receives	 a	 similar	 level	 of	 allowance	 when	 they	 work	 in	 the	
same	area.	
	

78. This	year’s	gender	pay-gap	report	showed	that	female	police	staff	receive	on	average	24.24%	
(mean)	 and	 4.67%	 (median)	 less	 Flexibility	 Pay	 than	 their	 male	 colleagues.	 	 This	 is	 due	 to	
different	roles	and	specialisms	that	attract	this	allowance,	which	have	different	male	and	female	
representation.		Specifically,	Technical	Staff	receive	the	payment	for	being	on-call	for	extended	
periods	and	it	is	a	mostly	male	dominated	role	at	present.

Current	allowance	-	On-Call	Allowance	
79. On-Call	 Allowance	 is	 paid	 to	 a	 member	 of	 police	 staff	 when	 the	 period	 on	 call	 extends	 to	 12	
hours.	 	 However,	 line	 managers	 have	 the	 discretion	 to	 authorise	 payment	 of	 the	 full	 On-Call	
Allowance	 if	 there	 is	 good	 reason	 even	 though	 the	 period	 is	 less	 than	 12	 hours.	 	 1,237	 staff	
received	the	allowance	during	the	snapshot	month;	75%	of	those	receiving	the	allowance	were	
men	compared	to	25%	women.	

	
80. Table	 49	 shows	 that,	 women	 who	 are	 entitled	 to	 this	 allowance	 type	 receive	 on	 average	 of	
37.5%	 (mean)	 less	 on	 call	 allowance	 than	 their	 male	 colleagues.	 	 The	 amount	 of	 on-call	
allowance	 varies	 depending	 on	 whether	 the	 on-call	 time	 is	 during	 a	 weekend	 or	 evening.		
Weekend	rates	are	substantially	higher	than	weekday	nights.		This	difference	will	be	influenced	
by	specific	roles,	as	only	a	proportion	of	staff	roles	are	eligible	for	this	allowance.

OVERALL	GENDER	PAY	GAP	-	COMBINED	WORKFORCE	SUMMARY	
	
82. Police	officer	and	police	staff	pay	is	determined	in	accordance	with	roles,	with	no	reference	to	
gender.			Female	and	male	officers	and	staff	who	undertake	the	same	role,	have	the	same	length	
of	service,	and	work	the	same	hours,	will	receive	the	same	pay.	
	

83. Police	officers	on	average	will	earn	more	than	police	staff	given	the	unique	nature	of	the	police	
officer	role.		Police	officers	and	police	staff	undertake	fundamentally	different	roles.		Different	
expectations	of	employment	are	placed	on	police	officers	who	are	not	employees.		The	unique	
status	 of	 their	 role	 is	 reflected	 in	 their	 terms	 and	 conditions.	 The	 approach	 of	 examining	 the	
gender	pay	gap	separately	for	police	officers	and	police	staff	is	therefore	appropriate.	

	
84. Nevertheless,	if	the	entire	workforce	is	considered	together,	the	MPS’	gender	pay	gap	analysis,	
when	 all	 pay	 and	 allowances	 are	 taken	 into	 account	 for	 the	 whole	 workforce	 (police	 officers,	
police	staff	and	PCSOs),	shows	on	average,	that	female	staff	employed	by	the	MPS	receive	£1.48	
less	per	hour	than	the	average	white	member	of	staff.		This	equates	to	a	mean	pay	gap	of	7.16%.		
The	associated	median	value	for	female	staff	employed	by	the	MPS	shows	they	receive	£2.67	
less	per	hour	than	their	male	counterparts.		This	equates	to	a	median	pay	gap	of	12.48%.		Much	
of	the	difference	is	a	consequence	of	having	fewer	female	officers	and	staff	represented	in	more	
senior	ranks	and	grades.		There	are	also	a	number	of	other	factors	that	influence	full	and	part	
time	working	decisions	and	these	also	impact	on	average	pay	calculations.

MPS	MEASURES	TO	REDUCE	GENDER	PAY	GAPS	

Officers	
85. The	MPS	is	strongly	committed	to	addressing	any	factors	that	impact	negatively	on	pay	equality.		
It	is	clear	that	a	pay	framework	that	rewards	length	of	service	and	protects	historic	allowances	
will	have	a	negative	impact	on	average	pay,	even	though	male	and	female	officers	in	identical	
roles	and	with	the	same	workforce	history	will	receive	the	same	pay.				
	

86. However,	there	are	differences	in	the	make-up	of	the	Met’s	workforce,	with	a	lower	proportion	
of	 female	 officers	 and	 staff	 in	 higher	 ranks	 and	 grades.	 	 Recruiting	 a	 more	 diverse	 workforce	
coupled	with	the	eventual	demise	of	grandfather	rights	to	historic	allowances	should	reduce	this	
disparity	although	it	is	likely	to	take	many	years.		In	the	meantime,	the	MPS	will	send	this	report	
to	the	Police	Remuneration	Review	Body.	
	

87. Continued	focus	on	recruiting	more	female	officers	will	likely	reduce	the	pay	gap	in	the	future.		A	
number	of	initiatives	are	already	in	place	to	achieve	this,	which	include	introducing	new	ways	of	
entering	the	MPS	at	entry	level	(Police	Now	and	External	Entry	Detective),	and	also	in	leadership	
roles	(Direct	Entry	Inspector	and	Superintendent).		Equally,	we	must	recognise	that	increases	to	
the	percentage	of	female	recruits	will	initially	have	a	negative	impact,	as	increasing	numbers	will	
sit	in	the	lower	pay	increment	levels	until	advancement	narrows	the	gap.		We	will	continue	to	
monitor	the	long-term	effects	of	these	initiatives	to	ensure	that	the	expected	underlying	positive	
impact	is	demonstrated.	

	
88. Ensuring	that	female	officers	continue	to	progress	into	higher	paid	roles	through	promotions	will	
reduce	 the	 gender	 pay	 gap.	 	 The	 promotions	 framework	 has	 already	 been	 redesigned	 and	
positive	action	is	in	place.		A	new	Career	Development	Service	(CDS)	has	also	been	introduced	
which	 includes	 mentoring,	 coaching,	 career	 planning	 and	 access	 to	 training	 to	 support	 both	
progression	 into	 leadership	 and	 specialist	 roles.	 	 In	 the	 majority	 of	 our	 promotion	 processes	
under	 the	 new	 approach,	 female	 applicants	 perform	 better	 than	 their	 numbers	 in	 the	 feeder	
grades.	 	 Similarly,	 continued	 focus	 on	 recruiting	 and	 retaining	 more	 female	 officers	 will,	 over	
time,	 increase	 the	 numbers	 in	 the	 feeder	 ranks	 increasing	 the	 numbers	 of	 those	 eligible	 for	
promotion.	

Police	Staff	
89. We	 recognise	 that	 a	 pay	 framework	 with	 incremental	 progression	 based	 on	 time	 served	 and	
allowances	that	are	predicated	on	base	pay	and	hours	work	will	result	in	differences	to	average	
pay.	 	 Addressing	 the	 gap	 will	 be	explored	 with	 Trades	 Unions	 through	 the	 forthcoming	 police	
staff	pay	negotiations	and	the	MPS	will	present	the	findings	of	this	analysis	to	the	Police	Staff	
Trade	Unions	as	part	of	that	process.	
			

90. Representation	 of	 female	 police	 staff	 in	 management	 roles	 needs	 to	 improve	 particularly	 as	
there	 are	 more	 female	 Police	 Staff	 than	 males.	 	 	 We	 will	 explore	 whether	 the	 CDS	 provision	
currently	in	place	for	female	officers	can	be	extended	to	police	staff	and	also	undertake	market	
research	into	the	barriers	to	recruitment	for	leadership	roles,	particularly	the	most	senior	ones.	

91. Further	 analysis	 into	 why	 less	 female	 police	 staff	 are	 undertaking	 roles,	 which	 attract	 shift	
disturbance	allowance	and	Premium	Payments,	will	be	explored.			Whilst	the	MPS	already	offers	
a	range	of	flexible	and	part	time	working	policies,	if	further	changes	are	required,	these	will	be	
explored	and	delivered	if	appropriate.
