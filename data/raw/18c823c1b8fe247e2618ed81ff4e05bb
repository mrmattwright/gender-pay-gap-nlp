by ensuring that training opportunities exist and that 
barriers to success are removed. 

We know we will thrive as a business when all 
employees feel inspired to do their best work, 
individually and collectively. We are already working 
to bring gender balance to our work force. As you’ll 
see from the results in this report, we still have 
opportunities to ensure more equal representation 
across our UK business, but I am proud to share our 
Diversity and Inclusion journey with you and we 
remain committed to closing the gap further in the 
coming years.

What is gender pay reporting?

Gender pay reporting is different to equal 
pay reporting.

Equal pay is about the pay differences between 
men and women who carry out the same jobs, 
similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful 
to pay people unequally because of their gender.

The gender pay gap shows the difference in 
the average pay and bonuses between all men 
and all women across an employer. 

Mean Pay Gap
The mean pay gap is the difference in the average hourly pay 
for female employees compared to that of male employees in 
an organisation.

Median Pay Gap
Median represents the middle point of a population. If you 
separately lined up all the women and men in a company, the 
median pay gap is the difference between the hourly pay rate 
for the ‘middle woman’ compared to that of the ‘middle man’.

The Percentages – Positive versus Negative
**A positive percentage represents female employees having 
lower pay or bonuses than male employees. A negative 
percentage represents female employees having higher pay 
or bonuses than male employees.

Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus
The percentage of the total male and female employee 
populations who were paid any amount of bonus pay.

Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile
Quartiles represent the pay rates from the lowest to 
the highest, split into four equal sized groups, with 
the percentage of male and female employees 
in each quartile.

Our stories

Here are just three of our team members who have 
experienced our diversity and inclusion at first hand. 
Read their stories here.

Gulen Bengi
Vice President & Managing Director UK and Ireland 
Kimberly-Clark Ltd

“At KC, we make essentials for a better life and what can be more essential 
than contributing to the development of people and communities around the 
world. I believe that my career is an example of KC’s commitment to 
developing talent and diversity. 

I joined KC in 2007 as a customer development director in Turkey, 
becoming a general manager. Since then I have led our business all around 
the world and am currently leading our UK and Ireland business as Vice 
President and Managing Director. In all my postings, I always appreciated 
my mentors, my leaders, my peers and most important the support of my 
teams as I went through the steep learning curves of leading in different 
cultures, languages and business environments, developing our business 
and our teams. 

Wherever I went, I always supported young female talent 
and KC has encouraged me to work to improve diversity 
and inclusion within the company and outside, including 
representing KC in our Catalyst award ceremony”

Tammie Fallows
Electrical Technician

“I joined K-C as an apprentice in September 2011 and qualified into an 
electrical technician role 4 years later. I am also a committee member of 
K-C’s Women’s Interactive Network. Kimberly-Clark’s values and 
commitment to equality and diversity are important to me and I would like to 
encourage more women to take on engineering roles within K-C as you are 
fully supported in everything that you do”

Kath Martin
EMEA Procurement Leader

“I joined K-C in 2001 as European IT Purchasing Manager. Between 
2003 and 2009, I held a number of European Procurement team leader 
roles, as well as starting a family and enjoying maternity leaves 
with my infant children.

In 2010, I was appointed to the role of Global Category 
Director for Packaging and in 2015, I took on a cross 
functional overseas assignment as factory manager at one of 
K-C’s manufacturing locations in Czech Republic.
I returned 
to Procurement in 2016 as Europe, Middle East and Africa 
Procurement Director. My experience shows that K-C 
actively supports female talent in progressing their careers”
