The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and women in an organisation.  The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.  The median gender pay gap is the difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.  Gender pay gap reporting does not mean that organisations have to report on equal pay.Â  Equal pay is about the differences in the actual earnings of men and women doing equal work.Â  Exchequer Solutions is an equal pay employer.  On 4th April 2018 we published our own gender pay gap report in line with government requirements.  Take a look at Exchequer Solutionsâ€™ report here.
