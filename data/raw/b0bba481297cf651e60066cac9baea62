We want to recruit, develop and retain a skilled and motivated workforce.       TEWV as an employer  We aim to be the best employer we can be and to have skilled, motivated staff providing excellent services.

Read about the Trust's achievements over the past decade in our special commemorative brochure "TEWV - the first ten years".    Valuing our staff  Our staff are our most important asset and recognising their excellent work and the vital contributions they make to patient care is very important. This can range from a simple ‘thank you’ in our weekly e-bulletin to nominating teams and individuals for one of our annual staff awards.  Last year 40 teams or individuals were shortlisted for our annual Making a Difference Awards and invited to a special awards ceremony. The Trust’s awards programme is extremely popular and last year received almost 200 nominations.  The bi-monthly Living the Values Award recognises staff who have clearly demonstrated the Trust’s values in their day to day work. In addition, the Executive Management Team names a weekly team or individual of the week for those who have gone that extra mile to achieve great outcomes.  We also hold an annual long service awards ceremony for staff with over 25 years services in the NHS.         TEWV is gold standard for its investment in staff...  We have achieved the gold Investors in People (IIP) standard and have been commended on great people management practice, and demonstrating a commitment to staff development. Find out more about our IIP accreditation...             TEWV is one of the top ten NHS places to work in the country says the HSJ...  We were praised for how valued and trusted staff felt to do their jobs and make improvements. They found that staff also work closely together and feel supported by their colleagues and by the Trust as a whole, with staff wellbeing promoted throughout all the services.      Looking after our staff's health and wellbeing  The health and wellbeing of our staff is vitally important and we work hard to promote and support this. Find out more about our health and wellbeing initiatives here .  A great place to work  Staff continue to recommend TEWV as a great place to work or receive treatment. Results from the 2014 NHS national staff survey confirmed we are one of the best NHS employers in the country.  We were in the top 20% of mental health and learning disability trusts in the country in 22 of the 29 areas covered, scoring the highest rating in two of those areas.  We were also in the top 20% of trusts recommended by their staff as a place to work or receive treatment and were among the best performing Trusts for engaging with our staff.  We also carry out the staff Friends and Family Test (FFT) three times a year.  This asks staff what they think about the Trust as a place to work and whether they would recommend the Trust to their family and friends as a place to receive treatment.

We're continuously improving services and winning new business  We have an award-winning system for delivering efficiency through clinician-led quality improvements rather than service cuts.  “I know of no other organisation in the UK or Europe that is so comprehensively implementing kaizen (continuous improvement) in a health care setting to the obvious benefit of patients, staff and users of resources. The whole of the NHS needs to follow where TEWV has led.” Sir John Oldham, national clinical lead for quality and productivity.  Our reputation for providing excellent services is helping us regularly to secure new contracts, which enable more people to receive the specialist support they need locally without having to travel outside of our region. Recently these have included providing:    specialist inpatient services for adults and children with eating disorders for the whole of the North East and North Cumbria. These are delivered from our new Northern Centre for Eating Disorders    mental health and learning disability services in Harrogate, Hambleton and Richmondshire    talking therapy services (a partnership contract) in County Durham and Darlington    mental health services in North East prisons (working with Care UK)    a new diagnostic, assessment and treatment service for adults with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in County Durham    Work for an award winning trust  Our staff and services have been recognised for awards both nationally and internationally. These awards recognise our success in developing and providing excellent services.  We invest in your training and development  Providing appropriate education, training and development is part of good employment practice and the trust actively encourages training and development of all of its staff. Learning and development supports changes and improvements in patient care, enables staff to take advantage of wider career opportunities and allows staff to realise their potential.  Training requirements are identified through the trust’s appraisal process and recorded in each individual’s personal development plan.  All new staff are required to attend the trust’s corporate induction programme and complete local induction no later than 8 weeks from their start date.  The trust has a responsibility to deliver a safe service to patients by ensuring that staff are appropriately qualified and trained and that they continuously update skills and techniques relevant to their work in accordance with the Health and Safety at Work Act, Standards for Better Health and NHSLA Risk Management Standards for Mental Health and Learning Disability Trusts.  A range of in-house programmes address needs identified in the annual workforce plan and training plan.  We also have a leadership and management development strategy to outline the approach towards leadership and management development activities. It is based upon a belief that a well led and engaged workforce has a positive impact upon the quality of care experienced by the users of our services and provides for greater levels of staff satisfaction with all the benefits entailed.  Raising concerns and improving our services  It’s important that our staff feel able to raise concerns about patient safety and let us know when we need to improve services. We have a number of ways in which staff can do this .  The 6Cs  The 6Cs are the six enduring values and behaviours that underpin 'compassion in practice', the national vision and strategy for nursing, midwifery and care staff. At TEWV we expect all our nursing and care staff to practice the 6Cs in their working lives.  Compassionate care and culture  With a focus on quality patient-centred care and staff wellbeing, compassion is key to all we do as a Trust. Find out more .  Gender Pay Gap Report  On 22 March 2018 we published our first Gender Pay Report .

The report is based on a snapshot date of 31 March 2017. The information is sourced from the Electronic Staff Record System (ESR), which holds our employee data. The information has also been submitted to the Governments Gender Pay Gap reporting portal.
