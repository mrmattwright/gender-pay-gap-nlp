VIEW ABOUT  Careers  Innovation  CSR    Media  Contact                        HOME / CSR    CSR  We recognise that the decisions we take as a business have the potential to impact the world around us. That’s why we take our commitment to CSR seriously and are committed to ensuring the longevity of our business through ethical, sustainable practices.  Our employees are central to this. We go beyond legislative requirements to create a workplace which meets the needs of our people and gives them the freedom to meaningfully impact society. This includes the provision of good pay and working conditions, alongside scope for training and personal development, as reflected by our IIP status which we’ve proudly held for 18 years.  Our employees are also encouraged to contribute towards the positive impacts we strive to make by suggesting charitable causes which could be supported, or ways our strategies and processes could be adapted to have greater impact. This underpins our commitment to sustainability by which we move beyond compliance with relevant environment regulations and take a proactive approach to realising positive change within our operations.  Testament to this is our commitment to technology. We adopt the latest technologies to constantly improve our services, alongside improving our impact on the environment through more efficient use of resources. These efforts not only improve our sustainability, but in turn, that of our clients, broadening our impact considerably.  Besides aligning our core operations to reflect our corporate responsibilities, we also participate in the community programmes of our clients who regularly run fundraising events or volunteering schemes. We find this to be one of the most effective ways to make a tangible impact within our communities, creating a lasting impression which counts.    Gender Pay Gap Report  As part of our corporate social responsibility, we believe sharing our Gender Pay Gap Report to be an important step in the conversation around equality in our industry. That’s why we’ve made our 2017 report available here, calculated in accordance to the necessary regulations to compare the pay of males and females.
