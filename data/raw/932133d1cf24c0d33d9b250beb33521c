Gender pay 
All companies with a headcount of 250 or more employees must report annually how they pay men and women. 
This report is based on Sanctuary’s pay and bonus data as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.

Gender pay looks at the difference between average male and female earnings across a group of workers, 
regardless of the role they are in, expressed as a percentage of male earnings. 

Gender pay is different from equal pay. Equal pay looks at ensuring everyone, regardless of gender, is paid the 
same for the same work. Sanctuary Group has robust processes in place to ensure that men and women are paid 
equally for doing equivalent roles. This includes regular reviews of pay levels across the organisation. 
How to interpret our gender pay report 
You will see on pages 2 and 3 that there are five pie charts displayed for each of Sanctuary’s legal entities. The first 
pie chart reflects the gender of total full pay relevant employees and the following four pie charts show the gender 
at the respective quartiles of pay, so the first quartile includes lowest paid staff and the fourth quartile includes the 
highest paid staff. 

A positive value reflects the percentage that men are paid more than women. For example, if a gender pay gap 
is given as 6.4 per cent, this means that, on average, men earn 6.4 per cent more than women. A negative value 
reflects the percentage that women are paid more than men. For example, if a gender pay gap is given as -6.4 per 
cent, this means that, on average, women earn 6.4 per cent more than men. The higher the number, the larger 
the gender pay gap.

The mean is the total number added together divided by the number of people in the legal entity. The median is 
the central value if all the values were arranged in order.
Our legal entities 
Sanctuary has eight legal entities which employ around or over 250 people. Sanctuary’s legal entities do not 
always correspond with the brands or operations that our customers and staff would know. To aid understanding 
of the statistics, the below table describes who works in each entity. The numbers included are full pay relevant 
employees.

Assessing our data 
In common with many large UK employers, our analysis shows that where a gender pay gap exists this is largely 
because there are more women in the lowest paying roles and fewer women in the highest paying roles.
Sanctuary recognises this challenge and is committed to supporting women across the organisation to advance their 
careers. Our executive pipeline, that is senior managers and directors reporting to members of Executive Committee, is 
currently 63 per cent female and 37 per cent male.
As Sanctuary works across a variety of industries, there is a diverse workforce across the different areas of operation. 
This means that women are under-represented in some areas of our workforce which we are actively working to 
address. 
The care industry typically attracts more women and therefore within our care operations, the workforce is largely 
female. There are also more women in senior roles resulting in small mean and median pay gaps and negative pay 
gaps in some cases. 
In comparison, Sanctuary Maintenance operates within an industry that has traditionally attracted a male workforce. 
The majority of Sanctuary Maintenance’s staff are skilled repair operatives, which is a profession that is predominantly 
male. Sanctuary Maintenance also employs a large cleaning workforce, which is overwhelmingly female. The 
difference in these roles accounts for the pay gap in this operation. 

Lynsey Squair, Operations Director - Sanctuary Maintenance, explains: “We are committed to tackling the stereotypes 
that exist around careers in repairs and maintenance and want to encourage women to consider taking up trade roles 
at earlier ages. We are actively working on this with Women into Construction, an organisation promoting gender 
equality in the construction sector, and by promoting opportunities for apprenticeships.”

As indicated by the bonus data, Sanctuary does not have a culture of incentivising performance through large bonus 
payments. Across Sanctuary’s employing entities fewer than two per cent of staff (152 employees) received a bonus. 
The small number of bonus schemes that do exist consist of commission for sales roles, recognition for delivery of 
large projects, vouchers from our staff award scheme and honorarium payments of up to £300. 
Where there are larger positive or negative bonus gaps this is because fewer than five people in each of those entities 
received a higher project related bonus compared to other smaller honoraria. 
The data for Embrace Care relates to the pay period prior to them joining Sanctuary in June 2017, when there were 
separate pay and bonus schemes in place. 
Actions we are taking
Attracting women into Sanctuary:
Sanctuary places importance on recruiting a diverse workforce in all areas of the business. All managers undertake  
recruitment training to remind staff of the impact of unconscious bias and ensure fair decisions are made. A variety of 
channels are used to target a diverse range of applicants and all vacancy adverts use gender-neutral language.
Sanctuary also works proactively to attract candidates to roles and areas traditionally dominated by a particular 
gender. For example as part of our focus on changing perceptions about the technology profession, we are signatories 
of the Tech Talent Charter and have a programme of activity to encourage women into technology roles.
Supporting women in the workplace:
Sanctuary recognises that creating and maintaining an inclusive workplace is central to making sure all staff want to 
stay with us. 
To deliver this, we aim to create an environment where all employees can reach their full potential. We offer flexible 
working arrangements and we pride ourselves on supporting our staff returning from parental leave or a career break. 
To enable women across the organisation to progress we provide a range of training and development opportunities. 
This includes our prestigious graduate programme which has employed 29 graduates since 2009 and of those 66 per 
cent have been female.

Diversity in the workplace

We believe in being an inclusive and diverse employer where all staff are able to reach their full potential. 

We confirm that our gender pay gap data calculations are accurate and meet the requirements of the 
Regulations.
