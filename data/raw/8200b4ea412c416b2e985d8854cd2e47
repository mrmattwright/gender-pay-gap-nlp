Pay quartiles are calculated by splitting our employees into four equally 
sized groups, based on their hourly rate of pay.

I confirm the accuracy of the data we’ve reported and also that we’re serious about addressing the 
gender pay gap it reveals.
Our gender pay gap is primarily due to us having a large proportion of women in non-managerial or 
customer service roles and more men than women in managerial, technical or specialist roles which 
attract higher pay.
Operating in a sector that has long struggled with its diversity, we’re focusing on how we can make all 
roles accessible to everyone and how we can create genuine opportunities for talented people. Flexible 
working, different approaches to recruitment and assessment, personal and career development, 
mentoring, apprenticeships, graduate schemes – these are some of the things we’re doing to make 
sure the Society is a great place to work where everybody feels valued, included and empowered. I 
am confident they’re also the things that are important in progressing our commitment to reduce the 
gender pay gap.
