Being a transparent organisation gives our patients and our partners  the information they need to make informed choices about their treatment and about our organisation in general, enabling our key stakeholders to hold us to account.  The government has set out the need for greater transparency to enable the public to hold public bodies to account, including making details about how institutions like the NHS operate. This includes publishing more clinical data, extending the friends and family test and other measures.        We currently publish information on our safe staffing levels , mortality (death) reviews , expenditure and gender pay gap information  Duty of Candour  We have a duty to be open and transparent when things go wrong and there have been mistakes in a patient’s care that have led to harm. This is known as the Duty of Candour, and it helps patients to receive accurate, truthful information from hospitals and other healthcare providers. It also sets out some specific requirements that we must follow when things go wrong with care and treatment, including informing people about the incident, providing reasonable support, providing truthful information and saying sorry.  We are committed to talking to patients and their carers at a very early stage to understand what happened and, where necessary, learn the lessons that will prevent it happening again to improve the safety of our future patients. This is very much part of our culture.  If you have any questions, or you would like to raise a concern, talk to a member of staff in the service concerned. If you are unable to do so, you should contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) and they will be able to advise you. Call PALS on 020 3513 6150.
