DECATHLON 2017 PAY GAP

As an employer with more than 250 employees we are required to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.

This involves carrying out calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of males and females in our organi-
sation. The calculations are based upon the snapshot date 5th April 2017.

APRIL 2017 TOTAL PAY GAP

The Total Pay Gap is the difference between male and female total pay, which 
includes pay, allowances and bonus. On a mean basis men were paid 13.7% more 
than women and on a median basis men were paid 1.4% more.

This results in a Total Pay Gap in favour of men.

The gender make-up of our team demographic and the working arrangements of some of our employee population means that our data 
isn’t necessarily representative of the real situation regarding the pay at Decathlon UK.

We are conﬁdent that our male and female employees are paid equally for equivalent roles across our business. We can conﬁrm that our 
data has been calculated according to the requirements of the Equality Act 2010.
