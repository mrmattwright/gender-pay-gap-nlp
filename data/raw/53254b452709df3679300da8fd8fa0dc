Our purpose and approach

Lincolnshire Co-op’s purpose is to bring together ideas, energy and 
resources to make life better in our communities.
We do this co-operatively with our members, customers, colleagues, 
suppliers and all the organisations, businesses, charities and good 
causes we work with.
Together, we focus on four main priorities – providing and supporting 
valued services, helping to grow the local economy, caring for our health 
and wellbeing and looking after our local environment.
We run more than 215 trading outlets across a variety of businesses 
including food stores, post offices, pharmacies, travel agencies, a 
florist and funeral homes. We also have three volunteer-run libraries, a 
pharmacy warehouse, a bakery and a crematorium.  
Our front-line outlets are supplemented by a range of support services 
including HR, Finance and IT. We’re a co-operative so also have teams 
working with our members and on community support.    
We have over 2,800 colleagues and we’re also passionate about 
developing our people, offering over 31,000 hours of on and off the job 
training to them last year.

The majority of our workforce is female:

As we run such a variety of different trading businesses, we have lots of 
front line customer service roles. For example, we have more food store 
customer service assistants than any other role – 910, as at April 2017.
Many such customer service roles are part-time which allows us to offer 
the longer opening hours which we know our customers and members 
appreciate. Part-time roles also offer colleagues flexibility in both 
working hours and shift patterns.  
We know that many of our staff choose such roles to allow them to 
balance their working life with other commitments, such as family, 
caring responsibilities or education. 

More of our female colleagues choose to work part time than our  
male colleagues:

Gender pay gap data
Companies and co-operatives with more than 250 employees are now 
required by law to report data on the Gender Pay Gap.
The method of calculation is laid down for us by law. It shows the 
difference between average hourly pay for all employees across our 
business. The gender pay gap data does not compare what women  
and men are paid for doing the same role. 
Quartiles
Dividing our female and male workforce into quartiles by pay rate:
• 

in the highest quartile, (quartile 4) we have roughly equal numbers of 
males and females (52% female). 
In the other three quartiles, we have around 3 to 1 females to males.

We offer our colleagues the chance 
to take two paid days of staff 
volunteering a year.

Therefore, the predominance of women in front line roles compared to 
the balanced split in higher quartile roles means the pay averaged over 
all colleagues is slightly lower for females.  
Median pay gap 7% (middle person of each gender) 
Mean pay gap 22% (average person of each gender) 
There is no difference by gender in rates of pay for colleagues 
performing the same roles.
Our mean bonus pay gap is 45%.
Our median bonus pay gap is 31%.
More of our female than male colleagues work part time.
More women than men are recorded in the gender pay statistics as 
receiving a bonus (83% vs 80%) but the official figures are lower than 100% 
as they reflect new starters who have not yet reached the day of payment.

Our approach…developing people
We aim to give all our potential and current colleagues equality of access 
to all our opportunities – to join us, to train, to progress and to succeed, 
fulfilling their personal and professional potential in the workplace.
We are an Investors in People Gold employer.
Gold was the highest recognition available at our last reaccreditation 
in January 2017 and we’ve held that status since 2011, showing 
Lincolnshire Co-op is committed to the highest workplace employment, 
development and recognition practices.
Here are just some examples of what we do to ensure equality of 
opportunity for all…
•  Prince’s Trust Get into Retail scheme
We run the Get into Retail scheme in partnership with the Prince’s 
Trust. It’s designed to give young people who have struggled to find 
employment the chance to get employability skills and practical 
experience and qualifications.
So far, 80 people have completed the programme and of those that 
accepted a position with Lincolnshire Co-op, 76% are still employed  
by the Society.
•  Apprenticeships
From food store managers and pharmacy dispensing technicians to 
cruise specialists and members of our leadership team – starting on a 
supported training scheme can be the first step to a long and varied 
career with us.
We’ve been passionate about developing people for many years; from 
youth training initiatives to more recent apprenticeship programmes.
•  Development and degrees 
We also offer a range of opportunities to earn while you learn 
throughout our colleague’s careers with us.
24 colleagues have completed a Foundation Degree in Business 
Management, which we designed and delivered with the University of 
Lincoln, a great example of partnership working. Of those, 6 colleagues 
went on to convert their foundation degrees into a BA (Hons) in 
Business Management.
We now have 10 colleagues combining their jobs with us alongside 
studying for a Chartered Managers Degree.
•  LEAP to it! 
LEAP stands for Learn Engage Apply and Perform. It’s an internal 
leadership and management scheme in our food business incorporating 
on and off the job training, which launched in September 2016. 
It provides colleagues with specific skills and increases their knowledge 
and awareness as future leaders.
Out of our 21 candidates, 6 have so far achieved management roles.
