Understanding Our Gender Pay Gap and Bonus Gaps

For the first time, UK companies with over 250 employees, are required to report on their gender pay gap. 
This is an incredibly important step forward and one that we welcome at Findel Education.

Our mean gender pay gap, as at 05 April 2017, was 35.2% which is greater than the national average of 18.4%.

Our analysis shows that both our mean and median pay gaps are driven by the make-up of our workforce, 
specifically a high proportion of women in administrative and support roles, for which the market rates tend 
to be lower. In addition 14% of our workforce are in part time and term time roles; of this 13% are female and 
predominantly in administrative/support roles. 
 
Whilst women make up the majority of our workforce overall, most of our most senior (and therefore highest 
paid) people are currently male. This is obviously not unusual and reflects national trends but has impacted 
both our gender pay and bonus gap.  

The make-up of our organisation, together with some exceptional payments relating to the activity of the 
last 12 months, has influenced our mean bonus gap in this report and for this year.

26% of our workforce are eligible for a bonus as part of their core compensation package, of which 60%  
are female.

How Findel Education is already tackling its gender pay gap
Findel Education is already working to tackle its gender pay and bonus gaps. Some positive steps have 
already been made, for example the gender balance at the Executive level has shifted over the last 3 years 
to 33% female representation (as at 05 April 2017).

We wish to continue to ensure that roles are filled by the best people, regardless of gender. However, 
we also want to ensure that women within our organisation and prospective candidates, feel able and 
supported to progress.

We are confident that we have policies in place that ensure recruitment and career progression are not 
discriminatory on the grounds of any protected characteristic, including gender.  

In order to narrow our gender pay gap and to ensure a more diverse workforce that reflects our customer 
base, it is essential that a greater proportion of women hold more senior roles than is currently the case. 
Findel Education is committed to supporting and facilitating this.

We have implemented a Leadership Development Programme to nurture, develop and promote leaders at 
all levels of the organisation. By the proposed completion date of September 2018, the Programme will have 
been attended by 25% of our workforce, of which 62% are female.  

Our mentoring programme provides support to mentees with career progression and opportunities for 
promotion. Currently 80% of our mentees and 40% of our mentors are female.

In the last year, we have supported employees to take up apprenticeships or other professional qualifications 
and we will now track this talent and support their ongoing careers. Currently the majority of our 
apprentices are female. 

The gaps, in both pay and bonus, show that there is more work to be done. 
  
Findel Education’s strategies for addressing its gender pay gap

The gender pay gap is complex, has no one single cause and we recognise a wide range of strategies will 
be needed to narrow it further.  Findel Education are committed to the following actions over the next 24 
months:

1. We will take steps to encourage more women into the organisation at senior levels:

• Recruitment – whilst we will always look to employ the best person for the job based on their skills and  
experience, we will aim to broaden our attraction methods to improve the number of applications received  
from women at senior levels.  

• Returnships – we will also target recruitment activities at those who are looking to return to work after 
career breaks (for example, maternity/adoption/shared parental leave), and provide appropriate  
workplace support.

We are actively looking to partner with external organisations who may be able to assist us with both of  
the above.

2. We will grow and support our female talent:

• Flexible Working – we already have a variety of part-time and term-time flexible working patterns in place 
and all employees are eligible to apply for flexible working after a qualifying period regardless of role and 
level of seniority.  

We will actively promote people’s ability to apply for flexible working arrangements across all roles, which 
we hope will encourage more women to consider more senior roles.  

• Learning & Development – we will continue to ensure that our Learning & Development provision provides 
a pipeline of talented women who are ready for career progression opportunities as they arise.    

The HR team will continue to provide support and challenge to line managers in recruiting and developing 
as diverse a workforce as possible.

3. We will look at our approach to compensation and benefits:

• We will keep our commitment to lower the gender pay gap at the heart of any decisions relating to 
significant remuneration changes across the business.

Whilst the gender pay gap is complex and has no one single cause, we remain committed to ensuring that 
we close the gap over the coming years.

We look forward to reporting on our progress in next year’s report.

The data in this report is accurate and in line with government reporting regulations.
