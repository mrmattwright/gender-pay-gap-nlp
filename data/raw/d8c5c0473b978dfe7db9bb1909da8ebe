Gender Pay Gap | REPORT 2017

What is the  
Gender Pay Gap?

The gender pay gap measures the difference between the 
average hourly pay of men and women in a company.
The gender pay gap is sometimes confused with unequal pay, 
however this is when one gender is paid less than the other for 
the same work.

What is Included  
in our Hourly Pay?

Hourly pay includes basic pay, car allowances. Shift pay, on-call 
and standby allowances, Payments for overtime, redundancy and 
sales commission, along with employees on family or sick leave, 
are excluded.

Behind the Numbers

We are very pleased to report a small pay gap of 0.6% mean  
and -1.7% median.
As an industry and organisation, we face a challenge to attract more 
women into the sector, and the demographics of our workforce is a  
key factor in the shape of our gender pay gap.
Over 80% of our roles are occupied by men, with a high percentage  
of males employed in our operational roles.
A large number of male colleagues working in operational roles  
are eligible to receive a fixed bonus based on the performance  
of their region / team, regardless of salary.
Our mean and median gender bonus gap in favour of women is 
predominantly due to our female colleagues being more broadly 
spread across a variety of roles outside of operations such as finance, 
commercial sales, HR and marketing. These roles are eligible for a 
corporate bonus scheme which includes both personal and corporate 
objectives, based on a percentage of their salary. These schemes 
typically make up a greater proportion of the overall reward package  
than the operational schemes.

Our Commitments

Whilst our mean gender pay gap is very small, and significantly better 
than the national average of 18.1%*, we are committed to regular analysis 
and monitoring of pay where we will continue to focus on addressing any 
gap we have.
While a lot of the difference in where our male and female colleagues 
work is down to individual choice, we understand that continued action 
needs to be taken to increase the representation of women, especially 
within our technical and operational roles, offering diverse and suitable 
roles for everyone.
