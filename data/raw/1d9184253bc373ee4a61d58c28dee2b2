OUR CULTURE

At Mercedes-Benz Financial Services 
UK Ltd, we promote a culture with 
people at its core. We invest in our future 
talent by offering a fair and transparent 
recruitment process, as well as ensuring 
our recruitment panels have a diverse 
mix of people, each bringing a different 
perspective to the selection process. 
When colleagues join us they are invited 
to an inspiring and thought-provoking 
company induction that is designed to 
offer an inspiring insight into our culture. 
We also have an active colleague forum 
that consistently looks at new ways to 
improve our approach to effective 
working, giving and receiving feedback, 
and making this a fun place to work. As 
part of this effective approach, we are 
proud to support flexibility within our 
teams, with 10% of our colleagues 
working part-time. We also promote 
inclusivity across our business and 
recently hosted the Daimler Financial 
Services international diversity dialogue. 
In addition, our colleagues are 
encouraged to get involved with our 
annual ‘day of caring’ where we tackle a 
CSR project and offer ongoing support 
throughout the year. 

talking about our wellbeing programme 
– Top Form – an initiative that covers 
four main areas of wellbeing; financial, 
nutritional, emotional and physical.

We work hard to ensure all colleagues 
have access to development 
opportunities regardless of their gender, 
background or any other characteristic. 
Our local talent entry programmes 
include our Degree Apprenticeship 
programme, which we launched in 2017, 
and a number of internal development 
programmes, including Elevate, a 
residential development programme for 
high potential leaders. We also offer 
international development opportunities 
across the wider Daimler group.

The majority of our colleagues are female 
and we recently carried out an equal pay 
audit across our business which did not 
reveal any pay inequalities and confirmed 
that our colleagues are paid equally and 
fairly when working in similar roles.

I confirm the gender pay gap results 
contained in this report are accurate.

It’s crucial for our colleagues to be the 
best they can be at work and at home, 
and that’s why you will also hear us
