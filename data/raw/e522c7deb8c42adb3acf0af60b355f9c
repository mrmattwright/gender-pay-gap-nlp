To ensure fairness, all hourly rates follow a bands and rates structure which has roles allocated to a band and movement within each band is based on tangible criteria and performance.  In order to take a proactive approach to gender pay issues, as part of our corporate social responsibility we support many grass roots initiatives to promote engineering as a career to young women and encourage the uptake of STEM subjects among girls.  This work is carried out in conjunction with the Reece Foundation https://www.reece-foundation.org/ and many of our female engineers support initiatives in their own time.
