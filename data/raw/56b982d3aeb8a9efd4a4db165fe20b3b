Gender Pay - Key Infomation    Dependent on skill and experience, we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across the company. However, the main reasons for our organisation-wide gender pay gap is an imbalance of male and female colleagues across the organisation in professional disciplines in comparison to nonprofessional disciplines, of which two thirds are populated by women.           Gender in Engineering    Whilst we possess a higher percentage of women in engineering roles than IET statistics demonstrate, we still endeavour to attract more females into STEM disciplines through targeted initiatives to assist in improving future female representation.                  Roles  In addition, at present there are fewer women in senior roles than men, and there are more women than men in lower scales, including crucial part-time roles.               Gender Pay Information    New regulations were introduced in 2017 that require employers to report on several different statistical measures of gender pay on the snapshot date of 5th April each year for non-public sector employers with more than 250 employees.  Gender pay information required by regulation can be found on the GOV.UK website and is also summarised below.                   How we are addressing the pay gap    We know we must be proactive about attracting and retaining diverse talent to help us achieve our company mission and accelerate our growth.    These are some of the current initiatives we have in place, as well as initiatives we are planning to implement next year; flexible working, flexi-time scheme, ensuring an inclusive culture, promoting STEM ambassadors who work with local schools/educational institutions promoting engineering to females, diversity initiatives, advertising promotional material, and proactive female board/management recruitment.
