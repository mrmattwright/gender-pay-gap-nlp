Gender pay gap reporting narrative
Gender Pay Gap legislation (developed by the Government Equalities Office) was introduced in April 2017 
and requires all public sector employers with 250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap for 
workers in scope as of 31 March 2017.
The aim of the College of Policing is to have an inclusive, diverse and representative workforce that values 
the difference people bring to the organisation. The Equality Act 2010 sets out that public bodies must 
have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good 
relations. Consequently the College’s approach to pay supports fair treatment and reward of all staff 
irrespective of gender.

College of Policing pay grades 
The College has its own local pay grades for National or London based staff. Grades vary according to 
the size of the role as evaluated using the Hay job evaluation scheme. Individuals are slotted into grades 
depending on the outcomes of the job evaluation scheme irrespective of the gender of the jobholders. 

The College of Policing gender pay gap position
The College in assessing its gender pay gap for reporting purposes commissioned an independent 
specialist to support the analysis of the data. This was to ensure robustness in the data analysis and to 
offer confidence and reliability.
Based on the Government’s methodology, the College is reporting median gender pay gap  
as 18.5 per cent with reportable mean gap as 17.3 per cent as depicted below:

How we compare
Based on Office of National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, the median gender 
pay gap in the UK has decreased from 22.5% in 2008 to 18.1% in 2016. The ONS also reported the Civil 
Service pay gap as 11.9% mean and 13.6% median. 

Pay quartiles
The College employs 61 per cent women and 39 per cent men and whilst there are broadly equal number 
of men and women in the upper quartiles of the pay ranking as shown below, the proportion of women in 
the Middle Lower and Lower paid quartiles is higher (at 65 per cent and 72 per cent respectively).

Steps to bridge the gap
A major contributor to our gender pay gap is the higher proportion of women in our Middle Lower  
and Lower band roles. 
The College has a good balance of men and women in the more senior roles (top two quartiles) and 
we will continue to ensure our practices maintain and support this. We will continue to monitor the 
gender balance across all grades in our organisation. A recent analysis of our data demonstrated that 
the proportion of joiners recorded as females has increased from 40 per cent (2014/15), 45 per cent 
(2015/16) to 61.4 per cent of total joiners (62 of 101 joiners) during 2016/17.

Flexible working is an important part of the College of Policing culture with approximately 28 per cent 
of our workforce being homebased. We believe this makes the College an attractive employer for those 
looking to have a home to work-life balance - particularly those with children at school going age.
The College of Policing is fully committed to fair pay irrespective of gender and we continue to 
review our policies and practices to ensure no group is disadvantaged. We continue to take action 
to address any gaps and to make sure our policies and practices are equality impact assessed for 
fairness across the board. Some of the initiatives being promoted include:

 

 

 gender equality has been made a central focus for the College’s Public Sector Equality  
Duties objectives 
 continually reviewing and improving our recruitment processes including introduction of 
anonymised recruitment process to reduce the potential for unconscious bias

  unconscious bias training for those on selection interview panels
 

 providing support for returnees from paternity/maternity/adoption leave so that they can adapt 
their work arrangements to balance their work with their caring responsibilities
 encouraging women to take advantage of promotional opportunities as well as participate in 
schemes that support career advancement such as the Civil Service Future Leaders Scheme and 
the Senior Leaders Scheme etc
 taking action to understand and redress the factors contributing to the higher gap within the 
Lower quartile band.

 

 

We take our commitments under the Equality Act seriously and focus on the right actions in order to 
redress any perceived inequalities, we are also mindful that meaningful and sustained change will take 
time and will require consistent focus by our most senior leaders.
