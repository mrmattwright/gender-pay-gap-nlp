This is our report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.    What is a gender pay gap?  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the pay between all men and women in a workforce.  Our gender pay gap is the result of the roles men and women work in at mhs and the salaries these roles attract.    Our results against the six reporting requirements  1. Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay: 2.5%  2. Median gender pay gap in hourly pay: 13.2%  3. Mean bonus gender pay gap: 26.7%  4. Median bonus gender pay gap: 0%  5. Proportion of men and women receiving a bonus payment: 100%  Overall our results are below the national average gap (17.4% mean and 18.4% median).  The mean bonus gender pay gap of 26.7% is because the executive team have a higher paid bonus scheme and last year this team consisted of all men. Recent recruitment will reduce the gap next year.  6. Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile:       Quartile  Men %  Women %    Upper  41.3  58.7    Upper middle  68.8  31.2    Lower middle  37.1  62.9    Lower  58.5  41.5       Summary  Overall, when comparing our results nationally, they compare well. But, we’re not complacent and are committed to doing more. We’ll keep our own performance in this area under on-going review and continuously improve the experience of all of our staff in respect of equality, diversity and inclusion.  We’re committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability.    What are we doing to address the gender pay gap?  We have a robust recruitment process to ensure there’s no bias/discriminatory practice and our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion means we’ll continue to look at how we can reduce our pay gap, and recruit the right people into our roles.  We’ll use every opportunity to attract women into roles where they are traditionally under represented such as surveying and property maintenance.
