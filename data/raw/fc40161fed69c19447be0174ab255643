  UK gender pay gap reporting     UK gender pay gap reporting  SNC-Lavalin, and its Atkins and Faithful+Gould businesses, are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment where everyone can realise their full potential as valued members of our team.  It’s the right thing to do – for our people, our clients and our shareholders.  The UK Government’s requirement for large organisations to be more transparent on the topic of gender pay is welcome, and we continue to work hard to address the gender imbalance in our business.  In 2017, we were pleased to welcome our highest ever proportion of women into early careers roles within our Atkins business – 31% of graduates and 21% of apprentices, compared with an average of 15% female engineering undergraduates in the UK.  We have launched a number of activities to support the progression of women in their careers, including the incorporation of unconscious bias training into our management development programmes, and the establishment of a Women’s Professional Network and a Women’s Development Programme.  We have also developed a range of flexible working options to help our staff to balance their personal commitments with their work commitments.  We have been encouraged that some of the initiatives we already have in place have been recognised by independent bodies, however, we also know that we still have some way further to go.  We want all our staff to feel valued within a diverse and inclusive workforce and continuing to address our gender imbalance is a key part of this goal.  We conﬁrm that the gender pay gap information and data contained in this report is accurate as of the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.
