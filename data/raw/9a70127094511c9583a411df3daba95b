Gender Pay Gap  
Report 2017

Foreword

At Venator, we’re focused on being a great place  
to work and we aim to provide equal opportunities 
for all 4,500 associates that work for us globally.  
We have a diverse and talented workforce, who  
are extraordinary at what they do, but we know 
there is room for us to improve.

This gender pay gap report measures the difference in 
average pay between men and women, regardless of 
their role in the organization, length of service or any other 
differentiating factors. This is not the same as equal pay, 
which is a direct comparison of two or more people doing 
the same or comparable work. At Venator, we ensure that 
we pay men and women equally for the same work.
Currently, within Huntsman P&A UK Ltd (now Venator UK 
Ltd), 33% of our associates are women. We are committed 
to bringing a better gender balance to our workforce that 
will help to close our gender pay gap. We know it will take 
time, but we will encourage more females to enter the 
chemical industry and will ensure that we support them to 
develop their careers.
It is important for us to recognize our gender pay gap 
and to ensure that we use this information to drive positive 
change to better reflect society. 
I confirm that the gender pay gap data contained in this 
report is accurate.

About

Under UK legislation that 
came into force in April 
2017, businesses (legal 
entities) with 250 or more 
employees are required 
to report gender pay gap 
details. For Venator UK Ltd, 
the following information 
reflects our employee data 
as at 5 April 2017.

Venator employs 567  
associates across the 
Venator UK Ltd legal entity. 
This covers two of our sites:

•  Wynyard site:  

Head Office for Venator; 
employs a range of 
corporate functions 
including IT, customer 
services, EHS, HR, legal, 
manufacturing, sales  
and marketing.

•  Greatham site: 

Manufacturing location  
that employs roles 
including technicians, 
engineers, production 
operators, quality  
and maintenance.

•  Within the UK, 33% of our employees are female

•  Majority of senior roles are filled by males

•  At our Greatham site we have a large majority of men in manufacturing and engineering roles 

•  Fewer women in higher paid senior professional and executive positions and more in junior roles

Working to close the gap

At Venator, we know that we will 
be successful if we harness the 
full potential of our 4,500 people 
globally and that our workplace 
reflects society. We know that we 
have work to do in this regard and 
earlier this year we addressed the 
issue with a number of our senior 
leaders across the business.

Simon Turner 
President and CEO

We acknowledge our current gender pay gap in the UK 
of 48% is not acceptable to us and we know closing 
the gap is not going to happen overnight. We commit to 
continuing the work we have already started and to focus 
on new initiatives to expedite change where possible. 
Our report also represents two very different Venator 
business environments in the UK and each has its own 
unique challenge. 
Our Greatham site is a manufacturing facility dominated 
by men, which is exacerbated by the difficulty in 
attracting women into shift based, manufacturing roles in 
the chemical industry. The challenge to encourage more 
females into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, 
Mathematics) careers is one faced by our entire industry 
and it’s something we can help change.
Our Wynyard site is our global HQ, where the overall 
demographic is balanced, but we have fewer women in  
the higher paid leadership roles. 
Our results for both Wynyard and Greatham are 
representative of an industry that has been male 
dominated for many decades and thus a large majority  
of senior roles within our organization are filled by men.

Our plan;
•  Inspiring females into STEM:  We will work closer with 
local schools and colleges to encourage more females 
to study STEM subjects. At Venator, we offer work 
placements and apprenticeship programs to support 
females entering the industry.

•  Succession planning: We believe in our current 
workforce and commit to developing our female 
associates for senior leadership positions. 

•  Flexible working:  We will support flexible working, 

where possible, to encourage associates to reach their 
full potential and we will review our policies to see how 
we can further improve.

In order to better reflect society, we know we have a long 
way to go. We will introduce a scorecard to make sure that 
we can all see the progress we are making to create a high 
performing workforce where there are equal opportunities 
for all. We will continue to address barriers to equality and 
diversity to help our associates and our business reach  
full potential.
