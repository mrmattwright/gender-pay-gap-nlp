Put the involvement and inclusion of our patients, their families, our staff, volunteers and the wider communities in which we work within at the heart of all that we do and all that we achieve   We have engaged staff and patient representatives to ensure that the strategy reflects what is important to staff and patients and in response, we have developed high level aims and categorised the activity planned under four clear outcomes which is aligned with the refreshed Equality Delivery System (EDS2)  Outcomes:   Better Health Outcomes  Improved Patient Access  Empowered Engagement & Well Supported Staff  Inclusive Leadership   Acknowledging the risks to achieving our aims, this strategy sets out our priority objectives and high level outcomes over the next three years under each outcome, focusing on ensuring that our people, systems, process, and services add value and are shared with staff, in a way that is accessible to them.
