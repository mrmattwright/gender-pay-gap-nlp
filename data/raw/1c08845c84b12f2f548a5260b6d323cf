GENDER PAY AT YARLINGTON

“YARLINGTON’S AMBITION IS TO BE A TRULY INCLUSIVE 
ORGANISATION WHERE INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY ARE 
EMBEDDED IN OUR CULTURE.”  

Living and, of those, 85% are female. Whilst not the only 
cause of our gap, these roles in society typically attract 
lower salaries and are dominated by females.  

Yarlington is really proud to see a good gender balance 
at the top of the organisation, with 47.7% of female 
colleagues compared to 52.3% male in our top salary 
quartile. This balance remains strong in our second 
quartile in which 46.5% of the colleagues are female

All bonus payments are calculated and paid fairly. Whilst 
there appears a gap this is because we calculate  our 
bonus on a pro-rata basis. As bonus payments were 
reported as cash figures, this does not reflect the  
pro-rata arrangements at Yarlington. 

However, as we look at the other quartiles the picture 
isn’t as positive.  Whilst any kind of gender pay gap is not 
good enough, it is also not surprising in a sector where 
a significant proportion of colleagues work in care roles. 
Almost 20% of our colleagues work in Independent 

Yarlington embraces flexible working and this is 
reflected in the significant percentage of part-time 
workers in the organisation - 23% of all colleagues. For 
the period concerned, these were all female.  

What is the Gender Pay Gap  
and why does it exist?
The gender pay gap is an equality measure 
that shows the difference in average earnings 
between women and men. In the UK it is just 
over 18%, which is the lowest level ever. It does 
not show differences in pay for comparable jobs 
– ie equal pay. Legislation has been in place for 
45 years to ensure that women and men are paid 
equally for comparable roles. 

The national pay gap is caused by many 
factors including that a higher proportion of 
women choose roles that typically receive 
lower pay. And many higher paying sectors are 
disproportionately made up of male workers. 
Nationally, you are far more likey to be part time 
if you are female and on average, will therefore 
earn less. There is also a greater proportion of 
men who progress into senior and higher paid 
roles.

   WHAT WE ALREADY DO 
Yarlington is absolutely committed to equal pay and 
narrowing any gender pay gap.

Each year we undertake analysis of our pay arrangements 
to make sure that remuneration is approached fairly and 
that men and women are paid equally for work of equal 
value. This ensures that fair processes are producing fair 
results. 

All salaries are benchmarked every two years to 
ensure that there is a fairness and consistency to our 
remuneration.  

Our recruitment practices make sure that roles are 
advertised using methodology that should not favour 
either gender and applications are screened without any 
gender awareness.  

  WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO 
We are passionate about increasing our overall focus on 
Inclusion and will look at how we can narrow the gap.  

RECRUITMENT: 

We will review our attraction and selection methodology 
to make sure that we appeal to the widest talent pool 
and that decisions are based solely on the applicants’ 
skills, knowledge and behaviour. 

We will also look at how we can better attract a more 
equal gender balance to all of our roles.

PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT:

Female employees receiving a bonus 

We will review how we identify and nurture talent to 
enable all colleagues, regardless of gender, to reach their 
maximum potential. It is important that we recognise 
that almost a quarter of our colleagues work on a part-
time basis and we need to ensure that our succession 
plans and promotional opportunities reflect this.   

WORKING ARRANGEMENTS:

Yarlington will continue to develop working 
arrangements that are attractive, flexible and agile 
in order to encourage retention and development 
regardless of gender.
