The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s earnings across an organisation and the report provides context and data on this across a number of measures. The report shows our median and mean gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, and bonuses paid in the year to 5 April. This is the first year of the new Government regulations which makes it mandatory for all organisations with more than 250 employees to report their gender pay gap on an annual basis.
