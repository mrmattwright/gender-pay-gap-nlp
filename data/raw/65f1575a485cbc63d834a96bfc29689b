GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

drives innovation. A cornerstone of our diversity agenda is gender equality.

“Diversity is a business imperative. It fosters better decision making, enriches our talent pool and 
diverse, at every level of our business. We believe the future success of our business depends on it.“

This report shows that BNP Paribas Real Estate in the UK has both a gender pay gap and a bonus 
pay gap. It is clear that there is work to be done to address this gap, and that it will take a collective 
and sustained effort from everyone to do so.

We  take  this  issue  very  seriously  and  we  are  committed  to  making  sure  that  we  become  more

Understanding the gender pay gap

Is the gender pay gap the same as equal pay? 
No. They are two separate matters, as explained below.

What is the gender pay gap? 
The gender pay gap concerns the hourly pay of all men who work in 
a company compared to the hourly pay of all women who work in the 
same company. It does not account for different types of jobs or levels 
of seniority.

What is equal pay?
Equal pay is when a man and a woman are paid the same for doing the 
same or similar work. We take our moral and legal responsibilities on 
equal pay seriously, and conduct reviews regularly to ensure salary and 
bonus decisions are fair and gender neutral.

Population by quartile 
Pay quartiles are calculated by ranking the hourly pay of all staff, then splitting the range into 
four equal quartiles and calculating the proportion of men and woman in each quartile. The 
higher proportion of men in the upper quartiles reflects the fact that there are more men than 
women in senior positions, and client development roles, which attract higher rates of pay.

Lower middle

There are two main reasons for the gender pay gap both across the Real Estate industry 
and at BNP Paribas: 
£  There are more men than women in senior positions. 
£  The higher salaries that senior roles attract, relative to other positions, significantly 
increases the average male pay both in the market and at BNP Paribas Real Estate

Overall, we have significantly higher mean and median bonus gaps than hourly pay gaps. 
This is because:
£  Bonus amounts tend to increase with seniority and we currently have more men 

than women in senior roles.

£  We have more men than women in surveying roles, which typically attract larger 

bonus opportunities.

£  More of our part-time employees are women. The calculation for the bonus gap does 

not account for bonuses being pro-rated for part-time employees.

Advocating for gender equality and addressing the gender pay gap is a responsibility that we take

change come. This report represents the Real Estate arm of BNP Paribas UK and I’m pleased to have 
this opportunity to share some of the initiatives that we have already put into place to close the 
gap, as well as our future plans.
