Bowers & Wilkins is world-class manufacturer of loudspeakers and has been based on the South  
Coast of England for over 50 years. We have a three sites, one being the main manufacturing plant,  
another	a	research	and	development	centre	and	a	small	office	in	London.	

At the snapshot date, 5 April 2017, we had 78% males and 22% females in our employment.  
We pride ourselves on allowing people to develop and change their career in later life and has   
allowed us to particularly redress the gender imbalance amongst our technologist and engineers.  
We ensure we pay fairly and equally across all areas of the business.

Our	figures	are	similar	to	our	peers	in	manufacturing,	these	partially	highlight	that	manufacturing		
and	STEM	careers	have	not	been	the	first	choice	of	females	when	choosing	a	career	path.	The		
biggest	problem	is	our	top	quartile	figures	skew	the	findings	as	it	is	where	we	have	legacy	seniors		
within the top level management. The warnings must be that for us those that will follow behind  
the top level will be male dominated until such times as STEM careers are seen as more appealing  
option to females.
