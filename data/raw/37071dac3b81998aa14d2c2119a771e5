Introduction
—

Paragon UK presents its Gender Pay 
Gap report in line with The Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017.  The legislation 
requires company entities employing 
more than 250 people to publish 
information about their gender pay and 
bonus gaps. 
Paragon fully supports the regulations 
in increasing transparency with regard 
to gender pay across our business 
and the wider industry. Paragons HR 
Director Lorraine Nixon said, ‘Paragon 
are fully committed to reporting 
transparently on the Gender Pay gap 
within our organisation and support the 
standardisation of reporting requirements 
from businesses. We will benchmark our 
gender pay gaps against competitors and 
best practice and commit to take action 
to address the underlying issues affecting 
salary gaps and bonus gaps that currently 
exist. We will continue to report on our 
Gender Pay gap annually, and anticipate 
realising changes as our “One Paragon 
People Strategy: Towards 2020” comes 
into effect.’

In May 2017, Paragon Group UK Ltd merged with a former 
subsidiary of the DST group, forming the Paragon Customer 
Communications UK division of the group. Therefore, 
as of 5th April 2017, this report provides data on three 
separate business entities: Paragon Group UK Ltd, Paragon 
Customer Communications London (formerly known as DST 
Customer Communications London), and Paragon Customer 
Communications Nottingham (formerly known as DST Customer 
Communications Nottingham). We have also provided an overall 
comparison taking into account our current business structure 
of relevant entities.

For the former PGUK Business the calculations for the six 
different measures are:

1. The mean gender pay gap for hourly pay is 10.2%.
2. The median gender pay gap for Paragon is 11.6%.
3. The mean gender bonus gap for Paragon is 41.7%.
4. The median gender bonus gap for Paragon is 23.4%.
5.  The proportion of male employees in Paragon receiving 
a bonus is 46% and the proportion of female employees 
receiving a bonus is 28%.

6. Proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band

What are the underlying causes of the Gender Pay Gap?
The Paragon business is diverse, operating across various 
sectors and industries. As part of the Gender Pay Gap process, 
we conducted an analysis of the Gender Split across our 
business in line with the ONS report, identifying the key roles 
below. Paragon overall gender split at the time of reporting was 
29.28% female and 70.72% male (552 females and 1,333 males). 
We benchmarked our gender breakdown against the key roles in 
which we frequently hire as per below. (Note: there was no data 
available for the gender breakdown of Print/Machine Assistants)

What are Paragon doing to address the Gender Pay Gap?
Paragon is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and 
equal treatment for all employees, regardless of gender or any 
other characteristic. Our employment strategy is gender neutral, 
as such we hire and promote based on merit. Paragon evaluates 
job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure.
While Paragons Gender Pay Gap compares relatively well within 
the key job functions identified, Paragon is fully committed to 
addressing the inherent gender pay gap within the organisation 
and are taking the following steps to address it. 

-  Paragon Policies and Procedures: Paragon have 
committed to a full review of all Policies and Procedures. 
Paragon will benchmark our employee offering to that 
of our competitors in order to ensure we are an industry 
leader and encourage equality and diversity across our 
organisation. 
-  Learning and Development: Paragon Customer 
Communications are committed to investing in Learning 
and Development across the business. In 2018 we have 
expanded our L&D team and will roll out our new Learning 
and Development Strategy later in 2018. This strategy will 
address skills shortages across the business and ensure 
fair and equal opportunities for male and female employees 
and prospective employees.
-  Senior Leadership Training: Paragon Customer 
Communications Board of Directors have recently engaged 
in an inclusive Leadership Programme to develop and 
enhance the tools, knowledge and ability to impact and 
inspire teams across the whole organisation, building in 
approaches in achieving the desired levels of equality, 
diversity and inclusion.

Paragon have recently been engaged in a period of change and 
integration following significant acquisitive growth. Throughout 
the coming year we will continue to work on aligning our 
employee offer across the businesses to ensure we can attract 
and retain the best calibre of employees, both male and female 
under one Paragon offering. 
Paragon acknowledges that there are significant challenges in 
the industries which we operate in, particularly concerning the 
industrial nature of our business. As we are investing in learning 
and development and training programmes for employees, 
we anticipate that the Gender Pay Gap will be narrowed in the 
long term as more female employees are recruited, developed, 
retained and promoted within the business. 
Paragon is committed to reporting annually on the Gender 
Pay Gap and implementing the measures as above to ensure 
continuous improvement on our figures and maintenance of our 
reputation as an employer of choice.
