In line with the UK regulations governing gender pay reporting, TJX in the UK is 
now reporting our UK gender pay gap. It is important at the outset to clarify the 
difference between equal pay and the UK gender pay gap. 

The principle of equal pay has been part of UK law for many years, and generally 
means that men and women in comparable positions receive the same pay for doing 
the same work. At TJX, we value and uphold this principle and are committed to the 
belief that individuals should be compensated competitively and equitably based on 
their role and skills.

The gender pay gap measures the difference in average hourly pay of men and 
women across all roles in an organisation regardless of the nature of their work. 

Equal pay means that men  
and women in comparable  
positions receive the same  
pay for doing the same work.

A gender pay gap measures the 
difference in the average hourly pay 
of men and women across all roles 
regardless of the nature of their work.

TJX UK 2017 GENDER PAY GAP

At TJX in the UK and our global parent company, The TJX 
Companies, Inc., we are very proud to be a global organisation in 
which women fulfil key roles in our stores, processing centres and 
offices. Gender pay equity is very important to us. 
Our culture of inclusion and valuing difference is a fundamental 
part of how we do business. We’re committed to creating an inclusive 
work environment where all associates feel welcomed, valued for 
their contributions and fully engaged with our business. 
Globally at TJX, women make up approximately 77% of our 
workforce and fill about 65% of our managerial positions.1  
As with our global business, we have a strong representation of 
female leaders throughout management levels in our UK business, 
including our President.
Using the calculations set out in the gender  
pay gap reporting regulations, the mean TJX UK 
gender pay gap is 13.1%. The median TJX UK gender 
pay gap is 9.7%.
While this is 4.3 percentage points below the UK national mean  
and 8.7 percentage points below the UK national median2, we are 

not complacent. We plan to continue to review our data with the 
help of an external consultancy to assess objectively our progress 
in identifying the factors influencing the gap and to take actions we 
believe are appropriate to address it. 
One major factor impacting our mean and median gender pay gap is 
that our organisation currently has significantly more women than 
men in lower and middle paid roles.
We believe it is important to continue to create opportunities  
for professional growth to further the development of women 
throughout our organisation. At the same time, we are continuing  
to cultivate a landscape where roles across all quartiles and 
throughout our business are equally attractive and accessible to  
both women and men.
To this end, we are creating an Inclusion and Diversity Group in 
Europe, bringing together a cross-functional and diverse team of 
leaders and associates. This group will work to support practices  
and policies that help us to reinforce our ongoing commitment to 
equitable pay principles and professional development.

The median 
national gender 
pay gap across 
the UK is 18.4%.

At TJX UK we have

The mean is what most people would understand as the average. The mean gender pay gap measures the difference between the average hourly rate of pay for men and 
the average hourly rate of pay for women.

The median is the middle point in a list of numbers, in this case the middle point in a list of hourly rates of pay. The median pay gap measures the difference between the 
middle hourly rate of pay for men and the middle hourly rate of pay for women.

QUARTILE PAY BANDS  
FOR TJX UK BY GENDER

As shown below, there are more women than men in our UK organisation across all four of our pay quartiles. In quartiles 1, 2 and 3 – 
which represent the lower to middle paid roles in our business – women outnumber men by around 2 to 1. In quartile 4, which is made up 
of the higher paid managerial roles, there is a more even distribution of men and women. 
If we use the same calculations as set out in the regulations to calculate the mean and median gender pay gap within each quartile, 
the mean and median gender pay gap is minimal on a standalone basis. However, when comparing all roles across all quartiles, the 
calculation of pay across all male and female associates gives us a 13.1% overall mean gender pay gap and a 9.7% median gender pay gap. 
The overall pay gap at TJX UK is significantly influenced by the greater number of women than men in our lower and middle paid roles.

business goals rather than individual 
performance or manager discretion. Eligibility  
for our bonus programmes aligns with the 
role each associate fulfils for the company. 
A significant element of bonus payments is 
calculated as a percentage of salary. 

OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT

We are working to better understand the factors that drive our 
gender pay gap to help us make informed decisions in the future. 
This will include learnings from our Inclusion and Diversity Group 
and the support of an external consultancy. Even if our mean 
and median gender pay gap is in line with many other retailers 
and below the national average, we are committed to continuing 
to foster a diverse and inclusive environment that provides 
equally attractive and accessible opportunities throughout our 
organisation for all associates to fulfil their potential.
