Senior Management and the Board of the Company are committed to inclusion in all its forms and believe that diversity enriches our work environment and provides social and economic benefits to all of our stakeholders.    We want to reflect the communities that we serve and we are pleased to be a signatory to HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter (further information is available here ).    As part of this commitment, made in 2017, we set ourselves a target to achieve a 50-50 gender balance at managerial level in our organisation by the end of 2020. One year on from this commitment we have improved our level of female managers from 39% to 42%. We are engaged in a number of initiatives to continue this progress, including further staff training and awareness, introducing new development programmes, raising customer engagement, seeking external best practices, providing more flexible working arrangements and improving our recruitment and selection practices. We still have work to do to achieve our goal and will continue to actively monitor our gender balance in the coming months and years ahead, and keeping this site updated on our progress.    AIB UK p.l.c has published its Gender Pay Gap report. Please click here to see the snapshot as of April 2017.    Embedding diversity across our organisation helps us to be the best that we can be in our thinking, our decisions and our outcomes. It is fundamental to our aim to be a successful organisation that all of our customers and our people feel valued and included.
