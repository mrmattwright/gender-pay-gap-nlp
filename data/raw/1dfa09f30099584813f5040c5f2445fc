The gender pay gap is a measurement of the difference between the hourly pay and average bonuses of all Ørsted Wind Power UK employees by gender.  From 2018, gender pay gap reporting is a legal requirement in the UK. This is a very important step forward for the business as it ensures transparency about gender based pay. Having an inclusive and diverse workforce is a fundamental requirement for our overall success. Reporting of this nature helps us to see where we might have issues and to find solutions that will benefit our employees and reflect our values.
