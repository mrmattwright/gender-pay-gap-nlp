What We Address      Protecting communities from flooding The UK Environment Agency (EA) estimates there are 2.4 million residential and commercial properties in areas at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea, and a further 3 million properties in areas at risk of flooding from surface water. As a flood alleviation partner for the EA and local authorities, we are helping protect those at risk.  Data and insight-driven water service improvements Efficiency, affordability, customer service and competition are among UK water companies’ greatest challenges. To address them, utilities need to build and manage infrastructure that is resilient to climate change, asset failure, peak demands and human interaction – at a cost acceptable to customers. We are helping deliver data and insight-driven outperformance of financial and operational targets.  Keeping the lights on The UK lost 11.4 gigawatts of coal and gas generation capacity in the three years leading to 2015. We are helping create the renewable, gas-fired and nuclear energy infrastructure that will help bridge the gap and provide cleaner energy for the future.
