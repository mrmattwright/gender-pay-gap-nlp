However, the enthusiasm is matched by Ali and the LupL team along with their curriculum knowledge / conviction which has been an inspiration." - Alison Capstick, Head of Teaching & Learning from The Whitehorse Federation:       Curious-city                          Curriculum design & innovation  Every setting is different. All our work starts with a frank and open conversation to make sure that we understand the situation and how we can be most useful. We support schools in a number of ways, with everything from a simple curriculum audit to the enquiry-led Curious-city approach, which localises NC2014 to each school we work with and maps national goals to engaging and inspiring enquiries. The easiest way to demonstrate what we do is to show you our past and current relationships, so here are a few of them:                 The Dolphin School  Creating an innovative curriculum The Dolphin School, our flagship Bristol setting, launched the Curious-city curriculum approach to coincide with the opening of their new school site.  Head Shelley Dixon saw this as a chance to establish something special. We have worked with all staff extensively to develop a curriculum that is right for them; local, culturally relevant and academically robust. In addition to design, we work alongside staff to ensure everyone can confidently deliver our exciting enquiry-led approach. Coaching, mentoring, training, providing access to a local network of education providers and visitors all come as part of the Curious-city offer. The response from staff, parents, Ofsted and most importantly the learners, has been amazing. Read full sections of the Ofsted report here                 St. Werburgh's Primary  Clearing the curriculum fog We were asked to go in and help streamline a vibrant and innovative curriculum bursting with whole-school initiatives. We reviewed their curriculum practice and attitudes towards it through face to face conversations with staff, pupils and parents. Working closely with the Curriculum Lead, we evaluated National Curriculum coverage, skills progression and teacher planning. The curriculum's strength, as well as St. Werburgh's existing links with the local community, role as a Rights Respecting School and other quality marks were clear, but topics had become unwieldy. We worked openly alongside the school to slim down their existing curriculum and make it more focused and effective.                 The Croft, Swindon  Firesides, caves, watering holes & forests After successful CPD and training work with The White Horse Federation and Swindon Teaching School, we were invited to find an innovative way to use a new space at The Croft Primary. We divided their classroom into four "zones" (firesides, caves, watering holes and forests) which each allowed children to work in a different way. To showcase the concept and as part of teacher CPD, we ran an enquiry in a day, which asked learners to consider the question of whether or not a building should contrast or complement the landscape. This used all the zones to facilitate the different modes of working and allowed pupils to research, collaborate and create in whichever way they felt most comfortable. Watch the Enquiry in a Day video           CC quotes                            "It aims to build on pupils’ curiosity about their own community and locality in order to develop their interest in the wider world. Structured around a series of interconnecting enquiries, the curriculum develops pupils’ knowledge, understanding and skills across a wide range of subjects." - Dolphin School Ofsted Report March 2018                                "Both Year 5 teachers – and indeed the whole of the school - have embraced the work with Curious City wholeheartedly.

The difference between those who flourish and those who struggle is good training and support. We've spent years running courses, advising schools and  training and mentoring to help new teachers thrive. We now also have our very own Salaried School Direct course, giving career changers a great route into primary teaching. Here are some of our past and current relationships:                 Salaried School Direct  Our experience in a full programme Having advised on and run ITT programmes for other institutions for four years, we have now initiated our own Salaried School Direct Course, in association with Swindon Teaching School. This allows us to take a small cohort of career-changers and train them to become the sort of versatile, confident and inspiring teachers that are sorely needed in education. The course incorporates the values of our Curious-city curriculum as well as support from our Coaching Partners Team, enabling us to provide schools with confident, capable teachers that can be the leaders of the future.                 Benefits for schools  Shelley Dixon, Dolphin School Head "We have been really impressed with the calibre of the teachers we have taken on from Lighting up Learning. They have arrived at school with a fantastic work ethic, a passion for the role and a great foundation for their NQT year. The training has clearly provided them with good subject knowledge, a clear understanding of pedagogy and the ability to reflect on their own practice. They have continued to make rapid progress and will be leaders in the school early in their careers."                   Benefits for individuals  Jo Lee, Cabot Learning Federation "I completed my initial teacher training with Lighting up Learning last year and landed a job in EYFS in my dream school. This is largely down to the comprehensive and practical training I received. Lighting up Learning delivered inspirational, hands on, practical training which suited my learning style as a career changer and really showed me the realities of life as a teacher. When I started my first role, nothing came as a shock as the team had given me such a wide variety of experiences during my training year. I felt prepared, confident and enthused for my second career."

Many people have experienced 'coaching' when in fact it was mentoring or are interested in it don't really understand how it can help them. It can easily be seen as a 'loose' approach when in fact it is robust, focused and highly effective. Coaching is for everyone and is a sign of professional and personal strength when an aspiring leader, struggling teacher or Executive Headteacher seeks out the insight it can provide. These are actual examples of work we've done and the effect it has had.                 George Samios, Twerton  Dealing with universal challenges of headship Headship comes with a unique set of pressures and challenges. Coaching for George Samios, Headteacher at Twerton Infants was a way for him to achieve clarity and perspective in the thick fog of leading a school. We were able to offer a blended approach of coaching and mentoring as agreed with George due to our personal experiences of being Headteachers. Coaching for us is something that, in the details, is extremely carefully tailored to the individual setting and people, but inevitably invaluable and all too often overlooked.                  Summerhill Academy   Supporting a school during transition While supporting the school in the period between headships we established a coaching and mentoring strategy for members of the Senior Leadership team. We helped to prioritise the demands of school life and identify key foci to address the School Development Plan and update the Self-Evaluation Framework. The resilience and adaptability that coaching facilitated in staff enabled them to meet the challenge of a shifting landscape with a refreshed, positive attitude and treat the period as one of opportunity, not threat.                   The White Horse Federation  From Cradle to Grave – Developing Successful System Leadership at all Levels The White Horse Federation obtained funding through the Round 1 SSIF bid to develop leaders at all levels of the system, using a 70, 20, 10 model.  This model works on the basis of 10% face to face training, 20% online training and 70% ‘on the job’ training.  Working in partnership with Cabot Learning Institute’s suite of NPQ programmes, Lighting Up Learning have developed a ‘pre NPQML’ programme aimed at emergent middle leaders (NQT +1 and 2).               CP quotes                             "Thank you so much for your detailed and practical coaching training.  It was really thought-provoking with lots of opportunities to practise, discuss and feed back about a variety of techniques, which I am sure will be very useful for many aspects of my professional life. Highly recommended to anyone starting out or interested in learning more about approaches to coaching." - Elizabeth Spincer, Saltford School                                 "Leading a school is a great privilege and also a great challenge. As a new Headteacher I have found regular Coaching to be essential. Through working with Kristian, over the past 18 months, I have been able to reflect honestly on my own performance, in a balanced way, and explore ideas and solutions to a wide range of issues and problems. Kristian is able to use his own experience as a Headteacher, to quickly build rapport and effectively focus his questioning, as a coach. I have found each session with Kristian to be energising and supportive. I have returned to school with renewed vision and determination. I would recommend Kristian’s coaching to any Headteacher as part of their own CPD and support for Wellbeing." - George Samios, Headteacher, Twerton Infant School & Nursery                                  "The informality of the session was really useful for discussion and development" — Jennifer Martin, Lainesmead Primary                    Use the form on our contact page  Team Leader - Kristian Hancock kristian@lightinguplearning.com 07912 291 640   Read about Coaching for individuals or whole schools and trusts    More of our past  and ongoing work   back to top                Leading to enrich, advance & develop  Many organisations outside of education have much more to offer schools than they know, or than they can communicate. It can be challenging for providers to understand what teachers need in order to make the most of a visit, centre or collection or even how they might be a useful part of a learning experience outside of their perceived sector of influence. These are a few examples of organisations we've worked with to develop or create a learning programme enabling them to effectively engage with schools:                 Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust  Activity programme creation We've worked with the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust over a number of years, continuously enhancing and refreshing learning offers to schools to training Learning Managers in questioning and enquiry-led learning approaches. Most recently, the LEAD team designed a series of activities to offer deep learning opportunities before, during and after visits to WWT centres. As per WWT's brief, we focused on the Science and Geography curriculum for EYFS to KS3 with the finished results available to use from April 2018.                 League Against Cruel Sports  Online & residential programme creation Two streams of activity form our work with LACS.  Firstly, we visited the unique and special protected animal sanctuaries in Devon to conduct learning feasibility studies.  We also used the charity's fox cub mascot and his friends as the basis for curriculum content for EYFS to Key Stage 4 . We are working with the LACS to create a physical and online learning presence,  enabling learners to become geographers, scientists and authors, ultimately leading to them being the next generation of conservationists.                 Blaise House, Bristol Culture  Revitalising work with local schools The project at the beautiful house that nestles in the grand setting of Blaise Castle Estate, is to re-imagine and revitalise the museum's work with both local schools and the wider community. It is the latest project in a long-established relationship with the Bristol Museums Service, building on our in-depth understanding of the organisation's culture, learning teams and collections.

Whether it's understanding how to move a single school forward or implementing system-wide change across a whole country, you need a delicate blend of understanding and the willingness to challenge entrenched opinions. These are some of the countries we've worked with over the past decade, helping governments and organisations make progress in even the most difficult circumstances:             Country-wide Headteachers as Coaches Programme, Jamaica Working with the Jamaican National College of School Leadership & British Council, we created and facilitated a country-wide training programme to develop Headteachers as coaches. Between 2014 - 2017 we trained hundreds of Headteachers as well as Master Coaches, now responsible for sustaining the programme in the years to come. Read the Article in the Jamaica Observer            'There's more to mastery than Mathematics', Taiwan Two visits to the British Section of the Taipei European School, enabled us to provide three whole-school myth-busting and thought-provoking INSET days followed by phase-specific surgeries. The energy and enthusiasm of the staff was extraordinary, especially considering Nicholas did not hold back on challenging some misconceptions around hinge questions and mastery related pedagogy.            Redesigning Initial Teacher Training, Colombia This is easily one of the most comprehensive projects we have ever been involved in. Since 2016, we have co-created every detail alongside the EFMMa team.
