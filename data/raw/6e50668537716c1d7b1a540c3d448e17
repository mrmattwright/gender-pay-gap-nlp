legal requirements   The three aims of the public sector Equality Duty are to:   eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and any other conduct prohibited by the Act;  advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it; and  foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it.   The information we have published (see links below) show that we have due regard to the three aims. This information demonstrates our compliance and sets measurable equality objectives, making our Trust more transparent and accountable to you.  Public Sector Equality Duty publishing requirement:      1   Firstly, the duty requires our Trust to publish details of the effect that our policies and practices have on the equality for service users and our workforce.    The Trust believes it is compliant with this duty and can provide evidence on the analysis we have undertaken via the Equality Objectives April 2012 report and the Annual Equality Report January 2016     2   Secondly, the duty requires our Trust to publish workforce information on inequalities.    The Trust believes it is compliant with this duty via the information contained within Section 3 of the Equality Report (January 2012) (see link above) and the Equality Workforce Equality Data .     Below is the Trust’s gender pay gap report, using a snapshot of data on March 31, 2017 and the action plan the Trust is following to close gaps where they arise:  Gender Pay Gap Report  ﻿               Follow us on Twitter  RT @andy4wm : The completion of the Midland Metropolitan Hospital which stalled following the demise of Carillion must be a priority.
