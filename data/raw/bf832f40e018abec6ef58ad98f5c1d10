The above image illustrates the gender distribution at eurochange across four equally 
sized quartiles.

We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs 
across our business.

Our aim is to drive towards a 50:50 gender balance. Gender pay gap reporting brings 
further  focus  to  our  long  standing  commitment  to  improving  gender  diversity,  a 
commitment that is at the core of our talent management and succession planning.

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
