                   Equality, Diversity and Inclusion  menu      Gender Pay Gap Reporting   Our University is a diverse community, and a huge variety of people contribute to its success. We value our staff and are committed to ensuring equal pay for all our employees, and addressing workplace barriers to equality, diversity and inclusion.      Reporting  As a university, it is appropriate for us to use an evidence-based approach to understand barriers to equality and to innovate when developing solutions. We are therefore pleased to present our inaugural Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 (PDF, 868kB) , a key step in better understanding our own position and the broad factors which contribute to pay disparity in our institution.  We are disappointed at the current gender pay gap within our institution, and we are committed to addressing this in partnership with our staff and unions.  The gender pay gap should not be confused with unequal pay. Unequal pay is the unlawful practice of paying men and women differently for performing the same or similar work or work of equal value; whereas the gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women.      Summary of the main findings:   At 16.2 per cent (favouring men), our median gender pay gap is lower than the Office of National Statistics UK-wide gap (18.4 per cent). The median pay gap is the gap between the middle occurring male and female salaries.  Women make up 55 per cent of our workforce but comprise just 41 per cent of the upper quartile of staff when we look at male and female staff by salaries.  Bonus payments are highly skewed towards male recipients when National Health Service Clinical Excellence Awards are included in the Bonus Gender Pay Gap figure (50 per cent median). This is concerning and emphasises the importance of ensuring parity in the number of male and female clinicians applying for and receiving these NHS awards. In contrast, the University Merit Pay system (excluding clinical awards) shows a significantly smaller gap (6.7 per cent median).   We acknowledge our gender pay gap and we are committed to reducing this in conjunction with our staff and unions.      Why is there a pay gap between men and women at the University?  A range of factors partially contextualise the findings in this report. The overall gender pay gap can be largely attributed to population distribution, with a greater number of men in the higher paid roles at the University. When clinicians (whose pay and bonuses are determined by the NHS) are removed from the bonus figures, the gap reduces.  The nature of an academic career can make it difficult for early career academics to progress quickly to more senior roles. Additionally, the higher education workforce is significantly comprised of individuals with expertise in specialised areas, therefore reducing the number of suitable candidates for vacancies.      What is the University doing to promote equalities?  During the last five years we have articulated our equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) commitments in the University Strategy ; established a Gender Equality Group ; increased our leadership development opportunities to progress women’s careers; enabled staff to apply for childcare expenses for attending conferences; continued to operate the Returning Carers’ Scheme ; have run ‘HerStories’ career seminars; established Faculty EDI groups; extended Athena SWAN to more Schools and maintained the ‘ Athena SWAN ’ accreditation as long-term tools to help promote female talent.      Our aspirations  The proportion of female professors has increased by 6.1 percentage points in five years from 17.4 per cent (2013) to 23.5 per cent (2017), the current level being in line with the Russell Group universities’ average. The University Strategy 2016-23 sets a target to increase the proportion of female professors to 33 per cent by 2022-2023 and we are enhancing the pipeline bringing forward female academic leaders.      While it is good news that our gender pay gap is below the national average, we remain utterly committed to ensuring that women and men can advance their careers equally to bring about career fulfilment, enabling a fully inclusive culture and harnessing even greater research and teaching success to sustain our university into the future. I am encouraged by our increasing number of female professors and that we are reviewing issues around the pipeline of female academics.   Sue Clyne, Co-chair of the University of Bristol’s Gender Equality Group and Head of Organisational Development     People are at the heart of our institution. Achievement of all our goals depends on the skills, professionalism and engagement of our staff. The University and its senior leadership team is committed to closing the gender pay gap and will continue to embed practices to attract, retain and develop our talented female staff.
