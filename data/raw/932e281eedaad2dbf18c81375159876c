Under the new government legislation, all businesses in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) with more than 250 employees must disclose their gender pay gap by 4 April 2018. The report highlights UniCredit's data and the measures which are underway to tackle this difference and demonstrate our commitment to making progress towards closing the gender pay gap in the future. Transparency is an important value to us and we strongly support the publication of the outcomes as this forms the first step towards addressing gender imbalance in the workspace.
