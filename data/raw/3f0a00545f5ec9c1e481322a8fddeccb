As an employer we are committed to promoting diversity and gender equality. We offer all of our people the same growth and development opportunities within a positive, open and inclusive environment. We have strong female representation throughout our workforce and women comprise 62% of our total workforce. Our approach to pay is gender neutral by design, which means that men and women who do equivalent jobs are paid equally.  Pay & Bonus Gap        MEAN    MEDIAN      HOURLY PAY    6.4%    7.5%      BONUS PAY    30.3%    25.5%      The above table shows our mean and median hourly gender pay gap and bonus gap as at the snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017 (pay) and in the 12 months reference period to 5 April 2017 (bonus)).  Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that it is largely driven by the fact that there are more men in senior higher-paid roles within the business. When we adjust for this factor our mean pay gap drops to 3% where any differences can largely be explained by experience and skill-set factors.  Bonus      GENDER    TOTAL COUNT OF GENDER    NUMBER OF GENDER RECEIVING A BONUS    % OF GENDER RECEIVING A BONUS      Male    383    216    56%      Female    626    337    54%      When looking at our bonus gap it is predominantly driven by three key factors, the first being that there are more men in senior roles, secondly the number of part time opportunities across our business, which are mainly filled by women (95% of Part Time employees are female) and thirdly the prevalence of women working within the Health sector, which as a newer sector for our business, impacts on bonus earning potential.      QUARTILE PAY BAND    FEMALE    MALE      Number of females in quartile    % of females in quartile    Number of males in quartile    % of males in quartile      LOWER QUARTILE    141    59%    99    41%      LOWER MIDDLE    164    66%    85    34%      UPPER MIDDLE    152    67%    75    33%      UPPER QUARTILE    127    54%    110    46%      At Lifetime we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. We continue to take action to address any gaps and to make sure our policies and practices are fair.  I confirm that the information and data reported is accurate as of the snapshot date 5 April 2017.  Tessa James  HR Director          Got a question?
