OK            Gender Pay Gap Statement    Published March 2018     Fragomen is invested in ensuring our compensation structure is fair and competitive.    As a leading international law firm, Fragomen is proud to have a high percentage of female staff, as shown in our breakdown via quartile. At the time of reporting, over two-thirds (67.5%) of employees were female. The UK practice is led by Caron Pope (Managing Partner), with the wider Europe, Middle East and African region led by Pauline Mathewson (Partner). We have a strong pool of new female managers who we are progressing and developing into senior roles.    We review our compensation bench-marking on a regular basis, across a range of metrics and sources. We believe the data highlighted in this report reflects that we pay employees fairly based on their role and contribution to the firm, not their gender, and we will continue to monitor our position to ensure we remain fair and competitive.    The bonuses we pay are also based on role and an individual’s contribution, not gender. Our 2016 bonus pool contained senior level male employees in higher level positions, predominantly corporate staff reporting into our US Global head office. This report has reinforced the need to set a fair and transparent bonus policy which we aim to roll out before the end of the year.    We are also looking at other ways to enhance the gender diversity of our workforce, including our Career Break programme which encourages those on career breaks to return to the workplace.    At the time this report was compiled, five out of our eight UK Partners are female, and in the US we have been ranked No. 1 in the National Law Journal's "Women in Law Scorecard" (percentages of female attorneys) for the sixth year running. We are very proud of the high standard of our diversity and equal opportunities at the firm and we will continue to grow our diverse workforce over the coming years.
