GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

At Shakespeare Martineau, we recognise 
that our people will always be the reason 
for our success. We are, and always have 
been, committed to creating a culture 
where everyone has access to equal 
opportunities for fulfilment and progress, 
and fair reward. 
We welcome statistics that require professional 
services to consider practices and misconceptions 
that have been accepted in some quarters for too 
long. We have included information concerning 
our partners, alongside that of our employees. 
Wherever we believe further information may 
add clarity, we have gone beyond the statutory 
requirements.  In doing so we have examined 
ourselves closely against our commitment to all 
our people, present and future: that people with 
the same roles, responsibilities and performance 
will receive fair reward.

The gender pay gap shows the 
difference between the mean 
(average) and median (mid-point) 
pay and bonus earnings of male 
and female employees expressed 
as a percentage of male employees’ 
earnings. A positive number 
indicates that men earn more than 
women; a negative number indicates 
the reverse.
The proportion of female and male 
employees in four quartile hourly 
rate pay bands ranked from lowest 
hourly rate to the highest hourly 
rate. It is calculated by dividing the 
workforce into four equal parts.
The proportion of female  
and male employees who were paid 
any amount of bonus pay.

The table (left) shows our mean 
and median pay comparison 
based on hourly rates of pay for 
male and female employees. 

Our gender pay gap is due to the 
distribution of women and men 
undertaking different types of roles in 
different disciplines across the firm.   
A large proportion of our legal 
support or business operations 
roles are undertaken by women 
within the lower or lower middle 
pay quartiles of the firm, which 
contributes to the gender pay gap 
seen within our mean and median 
results (left). There is greater 
gender parity within our upper 
pay quartile across both business 
operations and fee earning roles. 

Gender bonus comparison – employees
The table shows our mean and median comparison in bonuses 
paid to men and women. 

The mean bonus calculation includes our Chief Executive, who 
although an employee is paid an effective profit share aligned 
with that of our partners. Without such distortion, this results 
in a mean bonus gap of a more representative 2.4%. 

The median shows no bonus gap between males and females.

Proportion of women and men receiving a bonus 
Over 90% of both male and female employees were paid a bonus, this 
reflects our fair and consistent approach to rewarding our employees.

Gender pay comparison – partners’ profit shares
The table (right) shows our mean and median 
partner pay comparison based on hourly rates of 
pay resulting from profit shares, which represent the 
whole of the remuneration of partners. Our gender 
pay gap for partners is due to the gender split seen 
within our partnership and the roles undertaken.

There is a marginal partner

across the quartiles and within  
our upper middle pay quartile,  
our data reflects in favour of  
women with a pay gap of 15.9%,  
this is a reflection of the 
women in senior roles 
within our partnership.

Our commitment to equality: understanding the gender pay gap

The most important statistics to us within our 
gender pay gap report are the comparisons of 
mean and median pay where the levels of ability, 
roles and responsibility are most closely matched. 
It is interesting to note that in two quartiles for 
employees and one for partners, the measure is in 
favour of females, but we are keen to point out that 
a gap is a gap and we aim to constantly improve 
this balance. 

We are a predominantly female organisation, 
representing 71% of our total workforce. As a firm, 
we have made strides within our gender diversity 
and are proud that our senior executive team is 
75% female. However, our gender pay gap still 
exists primarily because of the distribution within 
different roles at the firm. We would like to continue 
to develop the pattern of more women seeking and 
achieving, with our help, more senior roles.  

We remain focused to ensure men and women  
have equal opportunities to progress to senior levels in 
both our partnership and business operations teams.

Shakespeare Martineau will continue to strive to 
improve every statistic we publish; we will always offer 
roles free of bias from any influencing factor except 
ability, and reward the best people with the prospect 
of the best careers.

We confirm that Shakespeare Martineau’s gender pay gap 
calculations have been calculated in line with the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
