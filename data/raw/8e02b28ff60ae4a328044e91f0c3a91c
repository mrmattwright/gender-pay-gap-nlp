2017 GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

Under a new law that came into force in April 2017, all companies with 250 or more employees on 5th April 2017 must annually 
report details of their gender pay and bonus gap.
 
Epwin Group is publishing its first annual gender pay gap report for its legal entities that employ more than 250 people.
 
All of the Group’s employees are UK based and principally employed by one of two legal entities. The larger,  
Specialist Building Products Limited, is in scope as it employs more than 250 people in the UK.
 
We have also taken the opportunity to voluntarily publish a gender pay gap report for Epwin Group Plc  
which covers Epwin’s entire UK workforce.
 
Epwin operates in the manufacturing sector, which historically has a significantly higher proportion
of male employees, 86.4% of Epwin Group employees are male. Having a greater awareness of 
the gender pay information has enabled us to take a holistic view of our company and we will 
continue to monitor our gender pay gap, focusing on ways to attract, retain and develop 
our diverse workforce.

Epwin continues to be committed to best corporate practices and ethical values
and aims to create a diverse and inclusive place to work across all levels and
locations of the business.
 
We confirm that Epwin Group Plc’s gender pay gap calculations are
accurate and meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010  
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.

What is gender pay gap? 
A gender pay gap is the difference between average earnings of men and women across an entire entity. The gender pay gap is not 
about equal pay. Equal pay is about job roles and deals with pay differences between men and women who are carrying out the same job.
