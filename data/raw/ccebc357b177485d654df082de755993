Gender Pay Gap Report 
2017

Redrow Homes Ltd

At Redrow Homes we recognise that 
supporting diversity is a key way to achieve a 
strong and effective workforce.
We constantly strive to promote diversity and particularly focus on attracting 
female new entrants into construction and technical roles that are currently male 
dominated.

We are pleased to note that our headline mean gender pay gap at 3.2% is 
significantly less than the current UK average of 18.1%.

I am pleased to publish the first gender pay gap report for Redrow Homes 
Limited and confirm that the data is accurate.

Our Results:
Redrow Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

Gender pay gap (hourly pay)

Gender pay gap (bonus pay)

Hourly pay gap

Mean: 3.2%
Median: 5.2%

Bonus pay gap

Mean: -33.4%
Median: -30.8%

The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between 
the mean and median hourly rate of pay for male and female 
employees, the gap is identified above.

The mean pay gap is the difference between the average hourly 
earnings of men and women and the median pay gap is the 
difference between the midpoints in the ranges of the hourly 
earnings of men and women.

The figures above display the difference between the mean and 
median bonus payments for male and female employees. Whilst 
every employee receives a bonus payment we have a mean 
gender bonus pay gap of -33.4% and a median gender bonus 
pay gap of -30.8%. This is because nearly a third of our female 
population consists of sales staff who receive regular significant 
commission payments whereas conversely we have a high 
number of male staff, primarily trade apprentices, who receive 
limited bonus payments.

Proportion of male and females

Male 79.31%  Female 83.79%
The figures above display the proportion of males and females 
within the company who receive a bonus.  

Every employee of Redrow Homes Limited receives a bonus 
and the results are due to the timing of the payments, which 
means that the bonus payments made to some employees did 
not fall within the relevant reference pay period for the purposes 
of these calculations.

In order for us to understand how the gender balance impacts 
pay, we split the proportions of male and female employees into 
quartiles, which is the gender split when the hourly rate of pay 
is ordered from highest to lowest and then grouped into 4 equal 
quartiles (Q1 being the upper quartile and Q4 being the lower 
quartile).  The pay quartile analysis shows that our proportion of 
men and women in each is remarkably consistent.

In summary:
Redrow Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

We are pleased to note 
that our headline mean 
gender pay gap at 3.2% 
is significantly less than 
the current UK average of 
18.1% 

Whilst we are pleased to note our gender pay 
gap is significantly less than the UK average, 
we recognise that we work in a sector where 
women are under-represented. 

We are also pleased to have achieved a 
41% female intake into our 2017 graduate 
management programme, clearly 
demonstrating an upward trend.

We focus considerable effort on attracting 
new entrants into the business through 
a range of training programmes and we 
continually explore ways to recruit a more 
diverse workforce.
 
For example, we have had success recently 
in our graduate intake by widening our focus 
from sector relevant degrees to all degrees 
and 33.8% of our current graduates are now 
female.

Over the next year we plan to introduce a 
mentoring scheme for our female trainees to 
make the most of the excellent role models 
we have within the business and to facilitate 
promoting more women into senior positions.
