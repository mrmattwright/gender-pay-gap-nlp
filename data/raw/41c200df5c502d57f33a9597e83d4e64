BD Network is an owner operated marketing services agency with under 50 
permanent employees.  We are required to publish a gender pay gap report 
due to the inclusion of casual promotional staff employed to support our clientsâ€™ 
campaigns by our staffing agency (The Staff Room UK).

We believe in creating a culture where people can be themselves at work, 
regardless of their gender or any other attribute or choice. We aim to ensure 
that people are treated equally, across all levels. This includes making sure that 
they have the same opportunities for recognition, reward and career development.
 
We are fully committed to tracking our data and taking positive steps to close 
the gender pay gap. 

BD Network already seeks to attract and retain female staff by, for example, 
having in place a policy providing for enhanced maternity pay which puts us 
ahead of our peers as published by the MAA (Marketing Agency Association), 
our industry trade body. It is notable that, at the time of publication, the 
majority of our senior leadership team is female.
 
We can confirm that the gender pay gap data contained in this report for BD 
Network is accurate and has been produced in accordance with the Equality 
Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
