Gender pay gap report

Introduction
In April 2017 the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 came
into effect requiring companies with more than 250 employees to publish their gender
pay gap, with the first publication to be made by April 2018, and annually thereafter.

Gender pay gap and equal pay: what’s the difference?

Equal pay and the gender pay gap are often confused.

Equal pay concerns pay for individuals or groups performing the
same or similar job roles. The gender pay gap is concerned with
the difference in the average earnings of men and women across
a business as a whole, regardless of their role or seniority. 

A company can have a gender pay gap despite paying male and
female employees equally for completing the same jobs, for
example, where the majority of women are employed in lower-
paid jobs and/or where there is a higher number of men holding
senior roles.

PAY PER PERSON

A hypothetical company ‘X’ has 50 employees (25 of
each sex), five grades and equal pay between men
and women at each grade, but different numbers of
men and women in each grade:

This report shows our gender pay gap statistics, our analysis of
the causes, and an outline of the actions we intend to take to
redress the balance.

Gender Pay Gap Statistics

ORDINARY PAY

The table below shows the mean and median gender pay gap
based on hourly rates of pay of those employed on the snapshot
date of 5th April 2017.

Mean hourly pay difference between male
and female employees

Median hourly pay difference between male
and female employees

12.2%

19.6%

The mean is the more commonly used average: it adds all the
hourly pay rates together and then divides them by the total
number of pay rates. Our mean gender pay gap shows that

The median is the middle pay rate in the list of pay rates. The
median is used so that the average is not distorted by a small
number of exceptions to the general rule. In the context of the
gender pay gap, it removes the distortion that one or two high
paid females have on the overall picture. The median therefore
presents a better measure of what is happening. Our median
gender pay gap shows that women were paid 19.6% less than
men across the whole company.

BONUS PAY

The table below shows the mean and median gender pay gap
based on bonus paid during the 12 months to 5th April 2017.

Mean bonus difference between male and
female employees

Median bonus difference between male 
and female employees

33.3%

33.4%

Our mean shows that women were paid 33.3% less bonus than
men as an average across the whole company. Our median
shows that women were paid 33.4% less bonus than men across
the whole company.

Proportion of males and
females receiving bonuses

The chart below shows the proportion of
males and females receiving bonuses in
the year to 5th April 2017.

Proportion of males and
females receiving a bonus

Proportion of males and females in each quartile

The charts below show the proportion of males and females in each quartile, from
lowest pay to highest pay. Each quartile has an equal number of employees in it.

Pay Band

Lower Middle

■ Females 95.7%   ■ Males 93.4%

Summary Analysis

The most significant factor causing
our gender pay gap is that only 15%
of our total employees are female,
and that 56% of those work in roles in
the Lower Quartile Pay Band. 

We are confident that our employees
are paid the same for equal or
equivalent work and we have robust
review processes for ensuring that
this remains the case over time.

■ Females 33%   ■ Males 67%

■ Females 8%   ■ Males 92%

Upper Middle

Quartile Pay Band

Upper Quartile 

Pay Band

■ Females 6%   ■ Males 94%

■ Females 12%   ■ Males 88%

The charts show that there are far more men employed at Ian Williams than women, with
the biggest difference in the upper middle quartile.  

Closing the Gender Pay Gap

Whilst it is perhaps unsurprising that a company in the
construction industry would have a higher number of male than
female employees, we do not accept that this is something which
cannot be changed. This report marks the beginning of an
enhanced strategy on equality and diversity so that we can look
forward to the gap closing in future years.
