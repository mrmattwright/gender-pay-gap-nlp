BRS GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

The UK government has introduced a requirement for all businesses with 
250 or more employees to publish annually updated information about 
their Gender Pay Gap.

The first set of data must be published by April 2018. 

It should be noted that the Gender Pay Gap is not about Equal Pay. The Gender Pay Gap calculation takes 
the average hourly rate for all women across the organisation and compares it to the average hourly rate for all 
men across the organisation, whereas Equal Pay is about ensuring men and women doing the same job are paid at 
equivalent rates. Where an organisation has a Gender Pay Gap this does not show that men and women are paid 
differently for carrying out similar roles. 

According to ONS figures for 2016, the median Gender Pay Gap across the whole of the UK was 18.1%. 

This means that BRS compares favourably with the UK as a whole.

UNDERSTANDING THE BRS GENDER PAY GAP

BRS has a gender pay gap significantly in favour of female employees. This is due both to the small number of female 
employees across BRS as a whole and also the dominance of male employees in driver and porter roles, which tend 
to be lower paid. Female employees are almost exclusively in White Collar roles, which attract a bonus, and this 
accounts for the higher proportion of women receiving a bonus payment. 
However there is still a bonus pay gap of 51.29%, mainly due to the dominance of male employees in senior 
management roles, which attract higher bonus levels. 

WHAT IS BRS DOING?

BRS is committed to a diverse workforce and to being an equal opportunities 
employer. Our office-based roles operate a core hours system, recognising 
that our employees need to manage their out-of-work commitments. And all 
our managers, regardless of where they work in the organisation, recognise 
the importance of non-biased decision-making in recruitment, having been 
fully trained in interview and selection techniques. 
Weâ€™ve also recently appointed Resourcing Specialists in our Warwick Head 
Office and also within each of our Truck & Bus Centre regions, who will be 
proactively managing our recruitment strategy to ensure we are attracting a 
diverse workforce.
