A beverage manufacturer asked Univar for help with a grapefruit juice that they
wanted to fortify with calcium and fiber. Univar’s food specialists were able
to recommend and source products that wouldn’t impact the juice’s flavor,
clarity or mouthfeel, and the final product was exactly what the manufacturer and

Univar employs a team responsible for marketing the products that make driving on

                                        Because of the stringent regulations surrounding pharmaceutical products, a formulation
                                        change, even if it's just a change in colorant, can create a deluge of notification,
                                        documentation and testing requirements for a manufacturer.  Univar's expertise in the regulatory process and our value-added administrative
