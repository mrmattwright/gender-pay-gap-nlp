GENDER PAY GAP REPORTING

Statement

At Superdry we pride ourselves on our diverse and inclusive culture. Centred around our six core 
values, which define the way we do things round here, our employees wholeheartedly agree that 
Superdry is a great place to work, where you can be yourself and feel fairly treated. 

The sharing of our Gender Pay Gap Report is the next step 
in the diversity conversation and in ensuring equality. For the 
purposes of this report our gender pay gap is calculated using 
the approach required by the regulations and compares the 
difference in the average pay of men and women. Like many 
organisations we currently have a gender pay gap, which 
we would of course aspire not to have. Whilst this is largely 
driven by the wider society norm that men are more likely to 
be in senior roles, we are keen to understand and address the 
reasons for it within our business. 

The gender pay reporting measures are very different 
from equal pay comparisons of the amounts paid to men 
and women for the same, similar or equivalent work. We’re 
confident that our approach to pay means that we do not 
allow unequal pay to exist within our organisation. We do 
however recognise that the gender pay gap figures shown 
here demonstrate that our most senior roles, and therefore 
those with the highest rates of pay, are largely filled by men 
and we therefore need to improve diversity in our most senior 
job levels.

We’re committed to continuing our support of employees of 
all backgrounds and genders in reaching their career goals 
and are actively working to encourage women to progress into 
more senior leadership roles. We’re proud of the ways in which 
our focus on learning and development, career conversations 
and a family friendly work environment facilitates this aim.

We can confirm that the data and information reported  
here is accurate as of 5th April 2017.

Our Superdry Family

At Superdry our Values, the things we really 
care about, shape our culture. They were 
defined collaboratively by employees from 
every part of the business. 
Family is one of the most important of our 
Values. From the start of Superdry, 15 years ago, 
it was clear that being part of a family is exactly 
how our employees see working for the brand. 
We’re in this together, as one big Superdry 
global family, always looking out for one another, 
excited by and sharing in our success.
We were delighted earlier this year to receive 
external recognition for this when we were 
awarded the title of Gloucestershire’s Most 
Family Friendly Employer. 
Family is the golden thread that runs through 
every aspect of our approach to people. Gender 
inclusivity is just one example of that golden 
thread. Here we’ve taken a look at three of our 
key areas of focus in promoting inclusivity:

What is a Gender Pay Gap?

A gender pay gap is a measure which shows the difference between the average pay of men and the 
average pay of women across an organisation, industry or other group. It doesn’t take into account the nature 
of their work and therefore can be influenced by the different number of men and women in particular roles.
An equal pay comparison is altogether different, it involves comparing the pay of two people or two groups 
of employees doing the same or equivalent work.

How is the 
Gender 
Pay Gap 
Calculated?

The way in which these 
calculations have to 
be made is set out by 
government regulations 
and involves analysing 
payroll data from UK 
employees across our 
various departments and 
job levels. 

Each measure that 
we have to report is 
calculated differently, 
here’s what they involved:

HOURLY  
RATE

MEAN AND  
MEDIAN GAPS

BONUS  
CALCULATIONS

PAY  
QUARTILES

Totalling the amounts paid to 
employees over the month for 
various things including their basic 
pay and pay for any leave, then 
deducting any amounts they’ve 
elected to pay into a salary sacrifice 
arrangement like our great cycle to 
work scheme, before dividing this 
figure by the hours they worked 
in the month. It is therefore quite 
different from the rate of pay that 
could be calculated from the 
contractual rate of pay an  
employee is entitled to.

To calculate the median gap we have 
to line up the hourly rates of pay for all 
of our female employees from lowest 
to highest, take the rate of pay from 
the middle, then repeat this for the 
rates of pay for our male employees 
and compare the rates we get. The 
difference between the two is the 
median gender pay gap.

Mean gaps are established by 
finding the average rate of pay  
paid to female employees and 
comparing this to the average for 
male employees, then again finding 
the difference between the two.

The calculations are much the same 
as the mean and median pay gaps 
for the bonus pay comparisons, 
although we calculate the bonus 
paid over a twelve month period, 
rather than calculating an hourly rate. 
We also report the proportion of 
men and the proportion of women 
who received a bonus in this twelve 
month period.

We line up our rates of pay for all 
employees from lowest to highest, 
then divide the line into four equal 
sized groups. We work out the 
percentage of female and male 
employees in each of the groups  
and these are the percentages 
reported here.

Paying Fairly at Superdry

Paying our people fairly has always been a clear priority for 
us and we have a robust system in place to ensure every 
colleague is paid fairly for their contribution. This means 
everyone can feel confident we make pay decisions  
free of bias whilst maintaining our position as an  
attractive employer.
Salaries are reviewed annually using external 
benchmarking insight from other UK & international 
businesses and internal cross organisational data. 
Additionally, to avoid bias around gender, race or other 
characteristics, we challenge ourselves on equality, 
including comparing roles across the organisation  
that are considered of equal value. 

6 GENDER PAY GAP REPORTING
Our Entities

At the snapshot date, 5th April 2017, we 
employed our 2,750 UK employees under 
Superdry Plc (then SuperGroup Plc) and 
3 UK subsidiary entities; C-Retail Ltd, 
SuperGroup Internet Ltd, DKH Retail Ltd.

The regulations require organisations of 250 
or more employees to report on their gender 
pay gap. Across the UK our C-Retail Ltd 
entity is the only business within Superdry 
that meets this requirement.

In the interests of transparency we have 
chosen to voluntarily share our gender pay 
data for the total UK business. This includes 

OUR COLLEAGUES BY JOB LEVEL

COMMITTEE

all the eligible UK employees of Superdry Plc 
and the 3 subsidiary entities listed above  
and will be referred to as ‘UK Group’.

Whilst the ratio of men to women was very 
similar in C-Retail Ltd and the UK Group,  
C-Retail Ltd employs predominantly in-store 
employees who tend to have fixed rates of 
pay with little variance between individual 
salaries. In contrast the UK Group employees 
a wider cross section of employees with 
more variation in individual salaries which 
means the gender pay gap reported at  
UK Group level is higher.

Gender Pay Gap 

The mean and median gender pay gap for C-Retail Ltd are 
very low at 1.2% and 2% respectively. This reflects the largely 
fixed rates of pay for our retail employees in this entity.

We’re pleased to see that the median gap reported at a UK 
Group level is relatively low at 4%. Our analysis shows that  
the mean gap of 19.3% is due to the fact that our senior  
roles, and therefore our highest paid roles, are predominately 
filled by male employees. There are fewer females in senior 
roles than males, driving a higher gender pay gap than in  
our retail business.

On the snapshot date at a UK Group level, 58% of our employees were female. In the highest pay quartile female

pay rates, were held by male employees. This is a key driver of the gender pay gap figures reported.

8 GENDER PAY GAP REPORTING

Gender Bonus Gap

We recognise that in the year preceding the snapshot date, bonus payments to female 
employees of C-Retail Ltd were 250.7% higher (as a mean average) than those made to male 
employees. This extreme gender gap is explained by the relatively few C-Retail Ltd employees 
who are eligible to receive a bonus payment and the quantum of individual bonus awards. 

At a UK Group level the mean bonus paid to male employees is 73.5% higher than female 
employees. This is because our more senior roles attract a higher bonus and more of these 
roles are held by men.

Our median rate of bonus paid to both male and female employees on a UK Group level  
and within C-Retail Ltd is £0. This means that our median bonus gap on a UK Group Level and 
for C-Retail Ltd is 0%..

The Proportion Of Male And Female 
Employees Who Received Bonus Pay

Within C-Retail Ltd 1.3% of men and 0.8% of women received a bonus payment of some  
sort, this again reflects the profile of these employees; they are predominately in-store 
employees, who do not have a bonus included in their remuneration package.

At a Group level 5.4% of men and 2.2% of women received a bonus payment.  
This reflects our gender profile at our senior job levels with significantly more of these  
roles being held by men. It is these more senior roles which attract a bonus award as  
part of their remuneration package.
