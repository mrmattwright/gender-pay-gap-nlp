YOUNG & CO.’S BREWERY, P.L.C. GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2018G E N D E R   P A Y   G A P

We welcome the UK Government’s new guidelines requiring large employers 
in the UK to disclose their gender pay gap. The data measures the difference 
between the average earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of 
their role or seniority. It is distinct from equal pay, which is about ensuring that 
men and women are paid the same for carrying out work of equal value.  
We are pleased to report that our mean gender pay gap of 
10.6% is substantially better than the national average of 
17.4% (National Office of Statistics’ Annual Survey of Hours 
and Earnings 2017).
These results reflect our commitment to ensuring that every 
colleague is treated with fairness, dignity and respect and has 
access to the same rewards and opportunities. 
Our customers come from a diverse range of backgrounds 
so it is crucial that our workforce reflects that. Our ongoing 
success is predicated on diversity and inclusivity which both 
influence our policies and culture at all levels throughout 
Young’s; everything we achieve as a business, we achieve 
through our people.
The benefits of a diverse workforce are very clear; diverse 
teams drive originality and innovation, leading to greater 
engagement at work and better decision making while 
simultaneously helping to attract and retain great people. 
We have made significant progress so far and have 
undertaken a number of initiatives in recent years to drive 
equality and inclusivity in our organisation. We have a good 
flexible working policy that we implement across our business.

As a well-known, consumer facing business, the advancement 
of women in the workplace is vital to Young’s ongoing success 
and we want to ensure that women have access to every 
opportunity in order to progress to top roles. Despite the 
results of our gender report showing that we are ahead of 
the national average, we are not complacent and we are 
also developing a number of initiatives to further reduce the 
pay gap, including assessing our flexible/agile working and 
maternity and paternity policies for all of our employees.
As a business we are focused on recruiting the best talent to 
our organisation and it is important to note that that we don’t 
discriminate based on gender; we employ the best person 
for the job.  We also promote heavily from within and invest 
significantly in nurturing our talent. 
We believe the strategies we have put in place will  
make a real difference.

YOUNG & CO.’S BREWERY, P.L.C. GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2018G E N D E R   P A Y   G A P   R E S U L T S

The results are based on 3,810 
employees, (2,249 Male and 1,561 
Female) and we are pleased to report 
that women represent 40% of our 
workforce. We are confident that 
women are well represented at all 
levels of the business.
Youngs’s has a mean gender pay gap of 10.6%, 
considerably lower than the national average of  
17.4%. Our median pay gap is 4.2%.
The proportion of men and women receiving a 
bonus is fairly equal at 47.6% & 49.7% respectively. 
However, our mean bonus gap is 26.6% and the 
median is 37.6%. Our bonus gender pay gap reflects 
the gender composition of our workforce and the 
fact we do have more males in our organisation and 
at senior levels. We have a high proportion of females 
in entry level roles where flexible working is more 
prevalent and we currently see more women than  
men wishing to work part-time.

The last requirement looks at our pay quartiles. We do this by splitting 
employees into four groups based on their pay, and showing the proportion  
of men and women in each group.
Our pay quartiles align approximately to where you’d expect them to be, based on our 60/40 demographic split.

We are proud of our work on diversity, 
but we know there is more we can do. 
Our aim is to reduce our gender pay gap and to achieve real 
progress. We are also building a more flexible working culture 
so that all our people are supported to work in ways that 
better suit their lives. We believe the strategies we have put 
in place will make a real difference and we are committed to 
achieving a better gender balance.
