Home page   About Hoople      About Hoople  Hoople is a private limited company with public sector shareholders namely Herefordshire Council and Wye Valley NHS Trust.  When was Hoople established?  Hoople was established in 2011, since which time we have grown and developed into a business that now delivers a wide range of services to strategic partners and customers. These services broadly cover:   Human Resources  Payroll  Information technology  Finance  Training and apprenticeships  Recruitment and DBS   Venue hire   Hoople team credentials and experience  Many of Hoople's employees were transferred from its original partnering organisations (Herefordshire Council, Herefordshire PCT and Wye Valley NHS Trust). As such, they provide a wealth of experience and a record of proven delivery within the public sector.  In addition, Hoople has recruited many staff from a variety of private sector industries who bring a depth and breadth of commercial experience and acumen.  This combination of cross-sector experience has enabled us to develop tangible and affordable business solutions that address the very different needs of our customers.  Our ethos  We remain true to our roots and are driven by financial stability and service quality rather than profit, ensuring that our prices are competitive and that we offer value for money to all of our customers.
