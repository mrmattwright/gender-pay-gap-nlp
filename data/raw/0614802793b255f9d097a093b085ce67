Foreword  

Welcome to our first report on gender pay as a new standalone business.

Research consistently shows that diverse workforces perform better. 
And as a people-focused organisation, it is important for us to make 
sure our workforce reflects the customers we serve.

We acknowledge that there is much to be done in this area both at 
NGA UK and Ireland and across the industry. But we are determined 
to build a culture where we can provide great careers for all our people 
and become an employer known for fairness and opportunity.

Measuring  
the pay gap

To understand the gender pay gap, this report contains a number  
of measures. 

The mean gender pay gap
This is the difference in the average hourly rate of pay between men and 
women across the whole organisation. 

The median gender pay gap
This is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of men’s and 
women’s pay. The national median gender pay gap is 18.1%*

Pay quartiles
This is the percentage of men and women in each pay quartile. The 
quartiles are calculated by listing the rates of pay for each employee 
across the business from lowest to highest. We then split that list into four 
equal groups and calculate the percentage of men and women in each.

Gender Pay Report 2017

Pay calculations: what’s included? 
The pay calculations are based on FTE adjusted total pay received in  
the month of April 2017 and includes basic pay, locational allowances, 
shift premia, bonus and commission pay, long service awards and other 
payments made through payroll such as car allowances. It does not 
include overtime payments and ‘salary sacrifice’ scheme involvement.  
At NGA UK & Ireland we have more salary sacrifice arrangements with 
females (521) than with males (445).

Bonus pay
In this report, we show:

• 

the proportion of men and women who received bonus payments.

the mean gap in bonus pay. This is the difference in average bonus for 

• 
  men and women. 

the median gap in bonus pay. This is the difference between the 

• 
  midpoints in the ranges of men’s and women’s bonuses.

Understanding  
our pay gap

NGA Human Resources UK 
Gender Pay Report 2017

The gap in median and mean pay reflects the fact that we have more 
women than men in our Operations department which provides support 
and administration. We also have fewer women than men in our technology 
teams, where roles which require very niche skills are found.

The gap in bonus pay is driven by a high proportion of men in our senior 
grades, where bonus payments are made as part of the reward package.

Closing  
the gap

At NGA UK & Ireland, we are committed to equality for all. We understand 
that while pay inequality may have a strong societal cause, there is 
much we can do to make sure that we close the gap as far as possible 
in our business. 

We plan to evolve our policies and practices in the areas of recruitment, 
retention and development to continue our commitment to be an 
employer known for fairness and a place where everyone can reach 
their full potential.
