Equality Action Plan  Our is a living document that focuses on eliminating discrimination on the grounds of age, religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender Identity, gender, ethnicity, marriage and civil partnership, disability and pregnancy and maternity.  Equality and Diversity Forum  We have an Equality and Diversity Forum group made up of representatives from our Board, Executive Team, each of our 8 Directorates, our Staff Networks and our Trade Unions. This group meets every three months to discuss equality and diversity issues and any actions arising are taken away and embedded in all that we do.  The forum members have Terms of Responsibility to adhere to.  Equality Annual Report  Our Equality Annual Report demonstrates the work we have undertaken to drive forward the equality agenda. The report outlines the different activity progressed over the previous year, our next steps and a summary of our workforce profile.  Equality Impact Assessments  Equality Impact Assessments support the delivery of our aims and values and is systematic and promotes evidence based consideration of how our work may impact upon different groups, communities and the Welsh language.  Through these impact assessments, we can look for positive impacts that can be strengthened, while potential adverse impacts can be eliminated or mitigated.  Natural Resources Wales is looking for feedback from visitors to our main visitor sites as part of its Equality Impact Assessment which it has a duty to carry out under the Equality Act 2010.  Equality and Diversity Assessment Report  We have undertaken an assessment of our main visitor sites to find out whether we provide fair and equal services and facilities for all, what we are doing well and what we can improve on.  Many of the recommendations from the report are about keeping up the effective work we are already doing. Other recommendations are being used to improve signage, path surfaces, communication with visitors, and the information and guidance we provide to staff to ensure we consider all protected characteristics at sites we manage.  Read the executive summary of the Equality and Diversity Assessment Report  Find out how the assessment was undertaken in Rachel Parry’s blog  Staff Networks  Our staff are encouraged to build and join internal networks that receive full support from the organisation. We value the input from our networks and listen closely to recommendations. We currently have 4 networks which are:   Assisted User (IT and Telephony) Group  Christian Fellowship  Dementia Friends  Gender Equality and Women’s Network  LGBT+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) Network   If you have any equality enquiries, please feel free to email us at: equalities@naturalresourceswales.gov.uk  Gender Pay Gap  Our gender pay gap calculation this year differs slightly as we are now complying with The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 methodology.  Our ‘snapshot date’ of the 31 st March 2017 shows a headline figure of 5.5%.  A closing of 2.3% from our 2016 7.8% result. Despite this encouraging result, we have set up a small working group who are drilling deeper into our data to try to find ways to further close this gap.  Our women’s hourly rate is lower by:   5.5% (Mean)  1.7% (Median)   Our gender split by pay quartile is:  Top quartile                           54.0% Men    46.0% Women Upper Middle Quartile         49.7% Men    50.3% Women Lower Middle Quartile         60.6% Men    39.4% Women Lower Quartile                      65.3% Men    34.7% Women  Natural Resources Wales do not pay bonuses.  To be compliant with the regulations, we have also published our data on the GOV.UK reporting portal .
