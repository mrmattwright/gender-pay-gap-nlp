Gender Pay Gap Report  Journeycall have now uploaded our gender pay gap report.  To nurture a culture which challenges, provides opportunities and encourages innovation and commitment amongst staff and rewards accordingly.  This is one of the key values of Journeycall and one that helps us to ensure we manage a business that is diverse, fair and equally representative of the community we employ.  Whilst we are proud to have a minimal gender pay gap of 0.66%, which is considerably lower than the UK average of 19.3% (Office of National Statistics) we recognise that there is opportunity for improvement to ensure that we maintain and where possible, narrow this gap further.  An overview of our data demonstrates that, whilst on the whole the pay gap between males and females is nominal, there is opportunity for us to explore and remedy any correlation between there being less females in junior management or career progression roles and more in lower level roles which require less responsibility.
