This sounds high but is similar to that seen in other NHS organisations and for us is almost entirely due to the impact of medical staff pay. If medical and dental staff are excluded from the figures, our mean gender pay gap falls from 30% to 2%. The reason that there is such a large impact of medical and dental pay is that historically these professions have been male dominated and so our longer serving, and thus higher paid staff, tend to be male. Fortunately this is now changing – there are more female medical school graduates than male and our new consultant appointments are now more equal. We will be doing more work on this to ensure we  progressively close the gap over future years.  Detailed information  All UK employers have a legal requirement to publish their gender pay data on an annual basis.  The gender pay gap calculation is based on the average hourly rate paid to men and women.  This calculation makes use of two types of averages; a mean average and a median average.   In simple terms, the mean is the average hourly rate and the median is the mid-point hourly rate for men and for women in the workforce.  The mean figure is the figure most commonly used.  The report for Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust reviews the latest data set, which covers the 12 month period ending 31 March 2017.  Our Overall results  Overall, across our entire workforce our mean gender pay gap is 30%.  This means that the average hourly pay rate for men is 30% higher than for women.  Our overall media gender pay gap is 10.5% – this means that the mid-point hourly rate for men is 10.5% higher than for women.  However, this overall figure represents the combined data for our Medical and Dental staff group and all other staff groups.  When this is broken down, our figures show:   For Medical and Dental staff, the mean gender pay gap is 23%  For all other staff who are not medical or dental (which is our largest workforce group), the mean gender pay gap is only 2%.   Our proportion of male and female staff should be taken into account when looking at our gender pay gap, as does the age range of our male and female workforce, as members of staff who have enjoyed long careers in the NHS can often be higher up the pay point scales than those who are just starting their careers.  In Barnsley, whilst we have a higher proportion of female staff in our workforce, we also have a significant proportion of our male workforce who are now at the point in their careers where they are senior medical staff and therefore are higher up the pay grades than some more junior members of staff. This is reflected in our overall gender pay gap and, as a trust, we recognise that this is a generational and societal issue.  We know that an increasing number of women are choosing medicine as a career and our figures show that we now have a higher percentage of female junior doctors than we do male.  In terms of senior leadership positions, we are pleased to report that in the time period reported on, we had more women than men on our Trust Board and within our senior structure.  Gender Pay and Equal Pay – the difference:  It is important to be clear about the difference between gender pay and equal pay. The solutions to equal pay and gender pay are different. Closing the gender pay gap is a broader societal as well as organisational issue. Equal pay is specific to men and women doing comparable roles for different pay.  Though we have a gender pay gap due to our disproportionate representation of men and women within the workforce (as reflected across the NHS), we are confident that we pay equally and fairly in accordance with the nationally recognised Agenda for Change and Medical & Dental pay structures and our locally recognised Senior Manager and Director pay structures.  Our future intentions:  As a trust we are committed to supporting the career progression and ensuring equal opportunities for women and men within our workforce. Our in house talent management programme is designed to nurture our future leaders regardless of their gender.  We have a range of family friendly policies, supporting childcare, flexible working, and leave provision and following this year’s report on our gender pay, we be introducing further gender monitoring information systems to enable us to track this in more detail.  We welcome this report and the findings.  The data has given us the opportunity to understand what else we can do to further reduce our gender pay gap.  Ultimately, our aim is to ensure there is no gap and that men and women are equally represented in the workforce at all levels.
