Moore Stephens LLP’s mean pay gap is 19.4%, with a 32.4% mean bonus gap. Our full results can be found in our Gender Pay Report 2017 .  We recognise there is a gender imbalance but understand that it is common in most professional services firms and the UK economy as a whole. Although our results are similar to our competitors, due to the higher proportion of men in senior roles and women taking career breaks and advantage of part-time opportunities, we still want to close the gender pay gap, and are taking action to do just that.  To find out what we’re doing to reduce the gender pay gap, see our report .  We recognise the strengths that diversity can bring, and are committed to equal opportunities and equal treatment of everyone at our firm.
