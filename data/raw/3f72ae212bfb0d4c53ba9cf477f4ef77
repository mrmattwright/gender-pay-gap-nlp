This spirit remains fundamental to our approach.  Over the years, we are proud to have created some of the world’s most famous, loved – and in more recent times, most shared – ideas: from the ‘Face’ ad for British Airways, to ‘Life flows better’ for Visa, and the ‘Life’s for sharing’ campaign for T-Mobile.  We are a full service, integrated communications network, with 114 offices in 67 countries, with our headquarters in London. Saatchi & Saatchi is part of the Publicis Groupe, the world’s third largest communications group.
