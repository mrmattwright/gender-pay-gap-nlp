What is QTS doing to address the gender pay gap?

• QTS is fully committed to the principle of equality in 
the workplace and has a clear policy to remunerate 
employees equally for the same equivalent work

• QTS recognises that the industry in which it operates 
has historically been male dominated with many roles 
falling within construction site base staff

•

•

Traditionally, engineering and construction are 
perceived as male roles, which consequently means 
that many top jobs are occupied by men

There is no quick win to close this gap, we need 
sustained focus on increasing the awareness of the 
opportunities that both female and male employees 
can have in this sector

Women in Rail 

• QTS currently has two female employees on 

the steering group for Women in Rail

• Our Commercial Director, Phyllis McLeish and 

our Marketing Manager, Lisa McGhee, give 
their time voluntarily to launch the Scottish 
arm of the group 

• Women in Rail helps to support young people 

into a career in rail and provides valuable 
networking opportunities with other likeminded 
individuals

• Women in Rail is committed to improving the 
diversity of the sector, an ethos which QTS is 
firmly aligned with

Education 

• QTS is committed to encouraging young 
women into STEM careers and is working 
hard to ensure that the next generation of 
school leavers are being educated and 
made aware of the opportunities that exist 
within this sector

• Our team regularly visits local primary and 
secondary schools throughout Ayrshire to 
talk about careers in the rail industry and 
engineering

• QTS also has produced collateral to 
showcase the railway industry as a 
valuable place to work and learn, with a 
focus on encouraging more women to get 
involved 

Education 

•

In January 2018, QTS opened its doors to 
journalism students at Clyde College to 
create a series of articles based around 
three topics, including women in rail. 
Members of the QTS team were 
interviewed about each subject, helping 
the students with their project but also 
educating them, and their readers, about 
the importance of women in engineering 
and rail. 

• Our Commercial Director, Phyllis McLeish, 
has also written first person pieces about 
the shortage of women in the engineering 
industry, published in leading publications 
such as Scottish Business Insider

Progression 

•

•

In the last 18 months, 10 QTS employees have completed 
apprenticeship programmes: 7 of these participants were 
women
Currently, we have 25 ongoing employees taking part in 
modern and traditional apprenticeships, with 12 of these 
women  

• We also have two young women who are doing day release 

at university in quantity surveying and estimating 

• Women are not discriminated against when it comes to 

promotions and opportunities that arise within the company. 
Every request is considered, regardless of age, gender or 
ethnicity.

However, the new applications for apprenticeships, and for the 
majority of site based jobs, are still predominately coming in from 

male applicants. This is why the education on encouraging 

females into the industry is so important. 

Women in Sport 

• Outwith the rail industry, QTS is also a big 

supporter of Scottish women in sport

• We sponsor a variety of athletes across 

different disciplines in sport through 
Scotland including ice dancing, athletics 
and alpine skating

• Commercial Director, Phyllis McLeish, sits 
on the board of Scottish  Women in Sport 
and is an active supporter of the charity 

• QTS is also a proud sponsor of FC 

Kilmarnock Ladies
