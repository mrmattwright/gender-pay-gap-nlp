between the average pay of men and women across the UK Company. As a Company with more than 250 employees, we fall within the requirements stipulated by the Gender Pay Gap reporting regulations. All figures have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. On 5th April 2017, which is the date the data had to be collected, the business of PANayltical Ltd had not transferred to Malvern Instruments and therefore the results shown are those specifically of Malvern Instruments Ltd. Our Gender Pay Gap Numbers   The first set of data shows that males are paid, on average, an hourly rate which is 12.83% higher than females. The median hourly rate gap is lower, with males being paid an hourly median rate 11.16% higher than females. With the gender pay gap for employees in Engineering being at 22% (EEF.org.uk) this is a great start; however we will endeavour to close the gap even further.   Quartile Pay To achieve these figures, we split the workforce into 4 pay bands, called quartiles. The charts show the proportion of female and male employees who fall into each of the quartile pay bands. We recognise there is a distinct difference between women and men in the Upper Pay Quartile; this is mainly due to more Senior positions in Engineering being held by males across the Manufacturing & Engineering industries in general.     Bonuses In 2017, 95.92% of females were paid a bonus, in comparison to 97.63% of males. This is due to the Profit Share Bonus being a Companywide scheme, irrespective of being temporary or permanent, which is paid out to nearly all employees at the Company. Bonus pay Mean 22.21% Median 5.87% How we are working to achieve a better balance We recognise that Engineering and Manufacturing are male dominated industries, and so we are even more proud that our VP for Research and Development is a woman. This has given our female students and Apprentices a role model to aspire to, as well as demonstrating our commitment to Senior Female Board members. We are an active member of Women’s Engineering Society (WES), where we have 15 individual memberships for our female employees. This gives them access to events, newsletters and attendance at the WES AGM. We have an active group of STEM Ambassadors at the Company who volunteer their time in and outside of work time to promote STEM subjects to young learners. We will focus to endeavour that we have at least one female Year in Industry student, one female Summer Student and one female Apprentice for each intake. We promote our Flexible Working Policy to all employees, which includes part time working and flexi-time to help parents achieve the work life balance they aspire to, as well as feeling supported throughout their career. We provide support for employees prior to, during and after maternity and parental leave to ensure they are fully prepared to return to work and continue their learning and development at the Company. One area we can aim to improve on is to have a balanced gender shortlist for recruitment, to ensure a fair and inclusive interview process. We will do this through increased training and awareness for hiring managers through out 2018. I declare this information is accurate and correct.
