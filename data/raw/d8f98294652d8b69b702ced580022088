RLC are committed to striving towards building greater equality across a more diverse and inclusive workforce. As an organisation we welcome this transparency.  The report is helpful in presenting an analysis of the organisation in relation to gender pay issues and for highlighting where we may wish to focus our attention in order to better understand and address areas of concern. Gender Pay gap between women and men:  The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the mean or median hourly rate of pay that male and female colleagues receive.  Median Gender Pay Gap across RLC employees in the UK  22.7%  Mean Gender Pay Gap across RLC employees in the UK  16.3%  Proportion of employees receiving a bonus:  No bonus values to compare for year ending April 2017.       In the Engineering Sector, there are inherently more men employed.  Increasing the number of women in the organisation is very important to RLC. We aim to recruit from the widest talent pool possible.  We look to encourage better gender balance as part of our diversity strategy.
