 GAP  
REPORT

At AAT we are proud of our diverse 
workforce and this is reflected in our 
gender representation with over half 
of our workforce being female. We 
have a commitment to improving 
our gender diversity at senior levels 
of the organisation and in support 
of this commitment we have signed 
up to the Women in Finance Charter 
and set a target of 40% females in 
senior management by 2022.

We also support equality through fair pay and 
our job evaluation framework has ensured that 
males and females at AAT receive equal pay 
for work of equal value. However, an increase 
in the proportion of males at senior levels 
throughout 2016/2017 has created a bigger 
gender pay gap. AAT is a small to medium 
size organisation and small changes at senior 
management levels have a big impact our gap.

Headline gender pay gap figures 

The gender pay gap is defined as the difference 
between the mean or median hourly rate of pay that 
male and female colleagues receive. 

The mean pay gap is the difference between average 
hourly earnings of men and women. The median pay 
gap is the difference between the midpoints in the 
ranges of hourly earnings of men and women. It takes 
all salaries in the sample, lines them up in order from 
lowest to highest, and picks the middle-most salary. 

These figures are provided in the charts opposite 
based on hourly rate of pay as at April 2017 paid in 
the year to 5 April 2017.

Bonuses

At AAT we have an organisation wide bonus which 
everyone is eligible to receive, if the majority of our 
targets are met. The organisation wide bonus is the 
same financial amount for all staff, however it is pro 
rata’d for part time workers and for those who joined 
throughout the year with a minimum of 3 months in 
post. The bonus gap figures do not take account of the 
pro-rata amounts, and as the majority of our part time 
workers are female, this impacts on the bonus gap.

Proportion of male and female 
colleagues receiving a bonus 
(performance award) payment 

Anyone who was underperforming did not receive 
a bonus, and as mentioned above only colleagues 
with less than three months service at the end of the 
financial year did not receive a bonus. Both of these 
factors impact on the % of males and females who 
received a bonus.

Why we have a gap
As mentioned at the outset 
of this report, we have a job 
evaluation process which 
ensures that we have equal 
pay for work of equal value,  
it is the lower representation 
of females in senior positions, 
and higher proportion of 
females in more entry level 
positions which has created 
this gap.

Next steps

→   We recognise that we can improve on 
our gender pay gap, and that we need 
to ensure females working at AAT have 
as much opportunity to move into senior 
positions as their male colleagues. We are 
working towards creating and embedding 
a more diverse and inclusive culture 
within AAT and have run some sessions 
on unconscious bias, as well as set up a 
group of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion 
champions from different areas of the 
business. We will be rolling out more 
unconscious bias training in 2018, with 
a priority on recruiting managers, and 
will be monitoring and measuring our 
performance against our targets as we 
move forward. 

→  One priority area of unconscious bias 

training will be recruiting managers as this 
is where any changes in the diversity of our 
staff take place. Workshops are planned 
for early 2018 for all recruiting managers 
to update their skills and knowledge, 
in addition to this we will be regularly 
reviewing diversity at each stage of our 
process to identify any potential areas for 
improvement.

→  We were an early adopter of flexible 

working practices and continue to remain 
committed to accommodating requests 
from all staff where possible, and recognise 
this is key to enabling women to return to 
work following maternity leave.
