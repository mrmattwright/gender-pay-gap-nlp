At Arup we are committed to creating an inclusive working environment based on merit, fairness and respect, one that encourages talented people of any background to produce their best work of the highest quality.  The Arup gender pay gap report, produced under the UK regulations, provides the calculated gap numbers and further details on how we are addressing our gap.
