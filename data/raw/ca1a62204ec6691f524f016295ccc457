Pay quartiles by gender    Band  Males  Females  Description      A  69.7%  30.3%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile    B  77.8%  22.2%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at or below the median    C  68.4%  31.6%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile    D  72.7%  27.3%  Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile       The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  Orbis is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above).  We have well established policies confirming our commitment to equal opportunities to ensure that no employee is subjected to discrimination in the workplace. This covers all aspects of employment including recruitment, promotion, opportunities for training and pay and benefits. Progress within Orbis is decided on individual capability. We want all employees to receive equal opportunity and encouragement for advancement. We also want all of our employees to feel that they are paid fairly for the work they do when compared to their colleagues.    How does Orbis’s gender pay gap compare?  The vast majority of organisations have a gender pay gap, and we are pleased to be able to say that Orbis ‘s gap compares favourably with that of the mean gender pay gap for the whole economy.The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17.4%. At 4.2%, Orbis ‘s mean gender pay gap is, therefore significantly lower than the average.  The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 ONS ASHE figures) is 18.4%.  At -1.9%, Orbis ‘s median gender pay gap is, therefore, significantly lower.         Orbis  2017 ONS ASHE whole economy      Mean gender pay gap  4.2%  17.4%    Median gender pay gap  -1.9%  18.4%       The proportion of men at Orbis who received a bonus in the 12 months up to 5 April 2017 was 71.2%, while for women this was 49.1%. All our operational staff regardless of gender, are entitled to a performance related bonus scheme, however, our median bonus gap reflects the higher proportion of men in roles, that under our current policy, attract a bonus scheme. Orbis employs 240 operational staff, of which 200 or over 83% are men and 40 are women.  The fact that our workforce contains such a wide range of roles from our Operatives servicing our customers, our call centre staff, our sales force in the field, the administrative, management and Executive team at Head Office and the high proportion of male employees in some of those roles means that completely eliminating the gap is a challenge. However, we are using these results to help us assess levels of gender equality at Orbis as a whole and to identify steps which we can take to make sure that opportunities are equal for all irrespective of gender.    What is Orbis doing to address its gender pay gap?  While Orbis ‘s gender pay gap compares favourably with that of organisations across the whole UK economy, this is not a subject about which Orbis is complacent, and it is committed to doing everything that it can to reduce the gap.  Orbis is also committed to keeping our pay and reward structures under ongoing review and we will be monitoring our bonus structures to ensure that strong performance is properly rewarded and that nobody feels disadvantaged in respect of their ability to achieve the incentives available to colleagues.
