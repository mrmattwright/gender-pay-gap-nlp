I never had any problems with you. Now I am with Bisley which is all possible because of you, so thank you!     Transport company    We have worked with Chris from Solsbury Solutions for approximately nine years for the supply of LGV 1 drivers for our 24x7 364 South Wales depot. We have always found Chris to be a dedicated, hard-working person who provides a quick and honest response to our requests when our demands fluctuate dramatically and at very short notice. Despite this, Chris managed to demonstrate a good understanding of our business and what expectations are required. Before making contact with Chris we used numerous agencies but after a short period of time we opted to use Chris as our 'go to' supplier and this has proven to be the right choice for our business and has helped us to manage customer spikes better in their business and subsequently allow us to retain and grow our business with them.     Laurie Price  Feedback from Newport candidate   I got a full time contract for Bisley Newport through Solsbury Solutions and found them to be very helpful along the way with great customer service. They were very friendly and always paid me on time with no problems what so ever. Would happily work for them again if a day job was to come available .      Store Manager   Since employing Solsbury Solutions Ltd for the supply of contract labour, the calibre of the labour used has increased significantly. The labour supplied is of a consistent quality with good time keeping skills and willingness to work. We have had little, if no problems with the individuals supplied, to the extent that we are looking to employ two of them for the future. Hopefully we can continue this relationship for the future.     Joseph James  Feedback from Newport candidate   Basically I am sending you this email to thank you very much for giving me the chance of work with your agency, I have found your agency one of the best plus so easy to talk to and down to earth thank you once again.      Staffing and Training Manager   I have been working with Solsbury Solutions since 2015. The team have been very professional, helpful and quick to respond to any staffing requirements I may have. They listen and take on board any feedback that I may have. They have also helped me out at very short notice     Frank  Feedback from Newport candidate   Great company and treat everyone as individuals.Really good people to work for and keep you busy.     Lee  Feedback from Southampton candidate   I have completed a temp to permanent position secured by Solsbury Solutions. Emma and all her staff at Solsbury in Eastleigh have been absolutely fantastic and can not do enough for you. Thank you so much to you all.     Manufacturing Business  Production Director   In the fast paced world of print we rely upon a support team of temp workers to help keep our finishing department turning. We deal with some very high profile end clients who demand top quality service and totally unrealistic turn-around times. Over the years we had tried various temp agencies, most of which have failed to meet the required standards within a matter of weeks. Meeting with Emma was a turn-around for us as not only did she listen and understand our requirements, but she actually acted on them and worked with us to ensure everything ran smoothly. If we needed an extra 20 people or just 2 at short notice, Emma would make sure that we had people that fitted the required bill and ensured that all details were taken care of so that we (as a client) didn't need to worry about anything other than completing the required task.
