We are committed to ensuring equality of opportunity, fairness of treatment, and work-life balance for all of our employees, and to offering an inclusive working environment in which our employees are able to make the best use of their skills and maximise their potential, free from discrimination. This is of crucial importance to our business. Entry into, and progression within, our Company is determined by the individual’s ability to do the job – it’s as simple as that. The current position across our business is nevertheless that we employ significantly more women than men. This is not because we favour employing women over men. Rather, it is a reflection of the retail sector as a whole, where women are typically over-represented compared to men. 2018 is the first year in which UK companies with more than 250 employees are required to report their gender pay gap data. The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average earnings of women and the average earnings of men. It is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings. For example, a gender pay gap of 15% means that, on average, the women earn 15% less than the men. A negative percentage means that, on average, the women earn more than the men. Gender pay gaps exist for a wide variety of reasons, some of which are unconnected to the workplace. For example, the stereotypical representations of men and women in certain professions in wider society, and the quality of careers advice provided to young people in our schools, can both be factors. There are also other factors over which employers have some influence, and greater transparency about gender pay difference will undoubtedly serve to encourage employers to act to tackle their gender pay gaps. It is important to understand that the gender pay gap differs from equal pay. Equal pay is about men and women in the same employment receiving the same pay and conditions for doing equal work. In contrast, the gender pay gap shows the difference between the average earnings of men across all job roles in an organisation and the average earnings of women across all job roles in that same organisation. At Oldrids & Downtown we are confident that our gender pay gap has not arisen as a consequence of men and women who were doing the same job being paid differently. Rather, it was because of the structure of our workforce. If equal pay is about pay, then the gender pay gap is about representation. At Oldrids & Downtown, as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017:       These figures clearly demonstrate that women were not under-represented at any level of our organisation.      In addition, of 20 internal promotions to management positions during the 2016 / 2017 and 2017 / 2018 financial years, 16 (or 80%) were women. This is greater than the percentage of women across our entire workforce, which was 73% as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.      Why then, does Oldrids & Downtown have a gender pay gap at all?       Our mean gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 was 13.5%. As the analysis above makes clear, this was not because women were under-represented at senior levels within our Company. Rather, it was because men were under-represented in our lowest-paid roles, which is very typical of the retail sector.    Our median gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 was 4.7%. Had we employed more men in lower-paid roles, it is likely that our median gender pay gap would have been 0%. The 4.7% gap was as a result of the median male employee having earned a modest amount of sales commission in the relevant pay period. In contrast, the median female employee, whose basic hourly rate of pay was exactly the same as the median male employee, happened to work on a sales department where she was not eligible for sales commission.   We have divided our workforce as at 5 April 2017 into four, equally-sized pay quartiles, each containing 206 employees. The proportion of men and women in each of these quartiles is shown below.           This shows that, in common with many other retail businesses, we employed many more women than men in our lowest-paid roles. However, this is not the case in the top pay quartile of our business, where the proportions were almost equal. When looking at the differences between the average earnings of men and the average earnings of women within each of these four quartiles (shown below), it is clear that there was not a significant gender pay gap in any of the four quartiles.     In addition to looking at hourly rates of pay, we have scrutinised the bonus payments made to our employees during the twelve months ending on 5 April 2017. A high proportion of our employees as at 5 April 2017 have been classed as receiving a bonus payment during the preceding year because they received either a payment from the John Oldrid Partnership Trust in August 2016 or a Christmas gift from the Company in December 2016 (or both). Almost 15% of the Company’s Shares are held in the John Oldrid Partnership Trust for the benefit of the Company’s employees. When dividend payments are made to the Trust and these are subsequently shared out, the amount each qualifying employee receives is based on his or her contracted hours. Equal sums are paid to qualifying male and female employees whose contracted hours are the same. In contrast, our Christmas gifts are not based on contracted hours. They are modest in value and increase with service. Male and female employees with the same number of years’ continuous service receive gifts of equal value, regardless of their contracted hours.     89.6% of our male employees as at 5 April 2017 have been classed as receiving a bonus payment during the preceding twelve months. The proportion of our female employees as at 5 April 2017 who have been classed as receiving a bonus payment during the same twelve-month period is almost the same, at 88.1%. Every one of our employees as at 5 April 2017 who did not receive a bonus payment during the preceding year had joined the business after the last date on which they could qualify for a Christmas gift.     Our mean bonus gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 was -2.2%. Our median bonus gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 was 29.2%. This gap was caused by the median male employee’s contracted hours being greater than those of the median female employee, meaning he received a larger payment from the John Oldrid Partnership Trust. Had the median female employee been contracted to work the same number of hours as the median male employee, the total value of her bonus payments would actually have exceeded those of her male comparator.   The data shown in this report is accurate as of 5 April 2017. For further details of the calculations used, please see: calculations in detail  The gender pay gap information for Oldrids & Downtown can also be found on the Government website at: Gender Pay Gap Details     I hereby confirm that the data contained within this report is accurate.
