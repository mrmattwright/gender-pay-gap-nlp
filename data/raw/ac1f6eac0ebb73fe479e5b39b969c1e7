national and sector averages.  This is largely because we pay the same salary to large bands of our employees, ensuring pay transparency and promoting equality. The small gap that we do have emerges from the higher proportion of men in the upper middle quartile of our employee population. This quartile of the business is mainly comprised of driver/HGV roles, as part of our dedicated in-house logistics operations. Only a small number of businesses maintain these operations in-house, which proudly sets us apart from others in our sector.  We continue to take active steps to ensure that men and women in the same role are paid the same, and are working hard to support women leaders within the organisation.  I declare that the data presented below is accurate as of 5th April 2017.   Terry King  Chief Executive Officer                Our Gender Pay Gap data  The figures provided in the charts below are based on hourly rate of pay as at 5th April 2017 and bonuses paid in the year up to that date.  For the purpose of this report on 5th April 2017 JB Global Ltd employed 1,141 staff who were considered full pay relevant employees. Of these, 22% are female and 78% are male.  Hourly Pay  Our hourly pay for female colleagues is 2.2% lower when measured as a mean average* and 10% lower when measured as a median average.  Pay Quartiles    Quartile  Male %  Female %    Top quartile  78%  22%    Upper middle quartile  88%  12%    Lower middle quartile  71%  29%    Lower quartile  75%  25%    Bonus Pay  49% of female colleagues were awarded a bonus; 58% of male colleagues were. Bonus pay for female colleagues was 13% lower when measured as a mean average, and 12% lower when measured as a median average.  * Gender Pay Gap Explained  All UK businesses of more than 250 employees must  publicly report on their gender pay gap (GPG), which is the measure of the difference between the average earnings of men and women across an organisation, regardless of their roles or the nature of their work. This is not the same as equal pay, which is the legal obligation on employers to pay men and women equally for work of equal value.  The GPG is calculated using ‘mean’ and ‘median’ averages.  Mean averages: The sum of the hourly rate of all female employees divided by the  total number of female employees. The same calculation is performed for male employees and the gap is expressed as a percentage.  Median average: The midpoint of hourly earnings when all values are listed numerically as a percentage  The GPG also reports on mean and median bonus gaps, number of male and female employees who receive bonuses, and the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure.
