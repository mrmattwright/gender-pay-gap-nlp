This is Savills UK’s first report under the UK’s new gender pay reporting requirements.  Mark Ridley, CEO of Savills UK and Europe, says: “We are part of an industry that has historically attracted fewer women than men, with the result that there are now more men than women at a senior level. Addressing this imbalance is a key focus for Savills UK and we believe that we have made significant progress over the last few years to improve diversity in our business. This is visible particularly in our graduate recruitment which has had a 50:50 male to female ratio for the last 4 years, females also account for 52% of Savills UK employees and were last year represented in 41% of our director promotions.”  We have also introduced a number of key initiatives to further improve our gender diversity. These include:   Unconscious Bias training  Diversity working groups  Coaching and mentoring programmes  Shared parental leave paid equally for both parents  Improved maternity leave policy  Wellbeing and Mindfulness programmes  Family friendly policies to support training and coaching for managers, going on maternity and paternity leave and returning to work successfully after maternity leave  Since our return to work maternity coaching programme both pre and post leave, we have seen a rise in female Directors returning to work from 10% to 95% over three years.   It should be noted that gender pay reporting does not compare people in the same roles or take into account their performance in role and therefore is not a measure of equal pay. However, we are confident that we pay all employees equally for carrying out a comparable role within the business.  Our gender pay results are reported as the overall mean (average) and median (middle number) hourly pay and the same for bonus.  Our key results are in line with the Property Sector as follows:   39% Mean Hourly Pay Gap (45% excluding Savills Management Resources Limited)  37% Median Hourly Pay Gap (44% excluding Savills Management Resources Limited)  79% Mean Bonus Paid Gap (82% excluding Savills Management Resources Limited)  69% Median Bonus Gap (82% excluding Savills Management Resources Limited)   Savills is committed to issues of diversity beyond gender and our approach is subject to continuous review. As a service industry our people are our best asset and we want to invest in and support our best people in order to provide the best service to clients.
