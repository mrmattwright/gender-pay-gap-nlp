Gender pay reporting shows the difference between the average earnings of men and 

women.  From April 2017, reporting this information in the UK became a statutory 

requirement for all employers with more than 250 employees.  We are required to 
publish the results of six calculations using the hourly pay rates as at 5th April each year.

These calculations do not reveal 

individual salary information.  

 

At the reporting date, we had 311 

people that we were required to 

report on.   

65% of these were women and 35% 

men, we therefore employ 

significantly more women.  Below you 

can find the results of the gender pay 

calculations for these CAFOD 

employees in the UK based on pay 
information on 5th April 2017;

Bonus Payments 

CAFOD does not pay bonuses to any staff and is therefore not reporting, mean or median 
data or the proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment 

 

Proportion of males and females in each 
pay quartile  

According to the most recent information 

from the Office for National Statistics the 

gender pay gap in the UK is 9.4%.  We 

are therefore pleased to be an employer 

with a pay gap lower than the national 

average.  We are also encouraged by the 

proportions of men and women in our 

higher paid positions.  However, we will 

continue to examine ways in which we 

can close the gap further.  As first step, 

we have identified that the most 

significant gap is currently within our 

mid-range salaries which is also where the majority of our women are employed.  This is, 

in part, due to a legacy from a previous pay system.  We would expect to see the pay 

gap close over time, as our new pay system become more established.  In addition, we 

will monitor the starting salaries of new appointments for gender equity and examine 

whether turnover is greater amongst our women.
