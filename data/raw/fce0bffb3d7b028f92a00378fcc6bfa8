Information on Bloomberg’s efforts to promote gender equality can be found here .  U.K. Gender Pay Gap Reporting  The U.K. Government introduced new legislation that requires employers with 250 or more employees in the U.K. to disclose the pay gap between female and male employees in the U.K. as of April 5, 2017.  Unlike equal pay comparisons which focus on differences in pay between employees who perform work of the same or similar value, the government-required format for disclosing gender pay gap figures illustrates the difference in average pay across all areas of a business in the U.K. regardless of role and into which wider marketplace factors can have an impact.  Bloomberg L.P. U.K. (“Bloomberg”) employees’ compensation is determined based on their job (function, role and responsibilities) and their performance, regardless of any classification. Bloomberg reviews the compensation of its employees to ensure there is no unfair treatment of employees in how they are paid, and utilizes tools based on performance and compensation data to help managers make compensation decisions that reward performance. Bloomberg also utilizes rigorous performance assessments to ensure employees have a clear understanding of their performance.  The key driver for Bloomberg’s difference in average pay (hourly pay rate) across all U.K. roles is the gender composition in certain higher paying roles at Bloomberg where the company recruits people with financial industry knowledge and from industries like technology that have an underrepresentation of women. For example, the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics reports that, across the U.K., only 10% of programmers and software development professionals and only 29% of financial institution managers are women.  Bloomberg has undertaken a variety of initiatives to provide more educational and training opportunities to women, particularly in industries like technology and finance where women are underrepresented. Bloomberg supports organizations that help increase women’s participation in STEM and finance fields, including the National Center for Women & Information Technology, Girls Who Code, Girls Who Invest, 100 Women in Finance, the Anita Borg Institute and the Young Women’s Leadership Network. Bloomberg also supports several gender focused initiatives for women and girls in the U.K. including WomENcourage, IT Not Just for Boys, U.K. Lovelace Colloquium and WeAreTechWomen. The women that participate in many of these programs are eligible for internships, scholarships, and special events hosted by Bloomberg.  These efforts, while far from complete, have helped improve Bloomberg’s gender composition. For example, over the past two years, female representation in Bloomberg’s Engineering department has grown by 16% globally.  The following is based on active employees in Bloomberg L.P. U.K. as of April 5, 2017 and reflect the statutory calculations as defined under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap information) Regulations 2017. The six categories below include: mean (average) and median (midpoint) hourly pay rates; mean and median bonus pay; and the proportion of women and men receiving bonus pay. All employees are also sorted based on their hourly pay from lowest to highest and the percentage of men and women in each quartile is shown (e.g., if there are 1,000 people then how many of the first 250 are women versus men and so on).        Hourly Pay Rate & Bonus: Difference between men and women (Bloomberg L.P. U.K.)   * All full-time employees receive a target bonus and as an employee’s total target compensation increases, their target bonus increases in tandem with their salary.       Pay Quartiles: % of men and women in each quarter of payroll (Bloomberg L.P. U.K.)         Elizabeth T. Mazzeo Chief Operating Officer, Bloomberg L.P.
