We were one of the first companies in the City to employ women in 1871 and have always recognised the benefit of a diverse workforce to help us better serve our customers, communities and shareholders.  The Prudential UK gender pay gap report 2017 reflects the fact that men and women have traditionally held different roles, particularly in the financial services sector. It highlights the fact that we have more men than women in leadership, investment management and senior operational roles across our UK businesses, and that we still have work to do to achieve our ambition of reflecting the communities we serve.
