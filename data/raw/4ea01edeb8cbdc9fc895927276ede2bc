The Government requires us to provide a snapshot of our data as correct on April 5 th 2017.           Gender Pay Gap Report  Gender Pay Gap reporting is based on government methodology focusing on the difference in average pay between men and women in an organisation.  Gender pay is not the same as equal pay. Whilst it is true that both deal with the disparity of pay women receive in the workplace, they are different and should not be confused.  Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive equal pay.  At Gateley, our remuneration is based on the appropriate level of experience someone has for the job role they are performing and not their gender.  We are confident we pay men and women equal pay for performing equal work.  Gender pay measures a very different metric – it is a measure of the difference between men and women’s average earnings across the entire organisation regardless of their job role.  Across the UK economy and society as a whole, currently men are more likely than women to be in senior roles and therefore earn more. Most organisations will therefore have a gender pay gap.
