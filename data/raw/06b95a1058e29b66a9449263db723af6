02 THE GENDER PAY REPORT 2017

At Calor, we strive together to make our workplace a great 
place for everyone. We are committed to treating all of our 
people fairly, recognising their value and rewarding them 
appropriately – regardless of gender.  

We believe that a diverse culture is vital to our success, as is 
attracting and retaining the best people, exclusively  
on merit.

One way to measure equality is with gender pay gap analysis. 
Legislation passed in 2017 requires companies with more than 250 
employees to report on, publish and submit their gender pay gap 
figures to the Government Equality Office on an annual basis. 

Our median pay gap figure between women and men of 9.2% compares 
favourably against the national average of 18.4% (ONS 2017). This gap 
can be explained by the demographics in different parts of the company, 
for instance we have fewer women in senior management roles. 

What you will see on these pages is a snapshot of our business figures on 
5th April 2017, as well as some context and reasons behind those figures. 

What is the gender pay gap?

When we talk about the pay gap, it’s important to understand what we’re looking at. The gender pay gap 
is a measure used to describe the difference in the average pay of women and men. This is regardless of 
what roles they hold and so is different from ‘equal pay’ which refers to comparing individuals who do the 
same or similar work. The gender pay gap is calculated using two separate methods; median and mean.

 

Median pay gap
Imagine we separated our employees by gender and arranged 
them in order of pay, highest to lowest. The median pay gap 
compares the pay of the woman in the middle of the female 
line with the pay of the man in the middle of the male line.

Mean pay gap
When we refer to the mean pay gap, we’re talking 
about the difference between the average hourly rate 
of all the men and all the women in the company.

How do we stack up regarding pay?
The median pay gap between men and women across Calor, expressed as a percentage of male 
pay, is 9.2%. This is below the UK average of 18.4% (ONS 2017) which is positive news.

 

The following charts

factors, displaying the

We can measure almost anything, but we need context to understand 
what the findings tell us. Many factors can affect the gender pay gap, 
such as the type of industry, sector or even location. 

Historically, men and women do tend to have natural preferences 
when it comes to the type of work they choose to do. A company’s 
legacy and the kind of work its people traditionally carry out can also 
have an impact.

At Calor, some of our functions are more 
heavily populated by men – engineers, 
drivers – while a higher proportion of 
women work in more office-based roles. 

Some roles require particular 
qualifications and skills, therefore 
attracting a higher pay level. Where 
these roles are dominated by men, the 
mean pay gap is affected. For example, 
drivers need specialist driver training. 
Today, as young people enter the world 
of work, companies, including Calor, are 
becoming more inclusive, giving more 
opportunities to both women and men at 
all levels and in all functions.

How do we stack up regarding bonus?

At Calor the vast majority of employees received a bonus in 2017. 

The bonuses are made up of; incentives, commission, December 
profit share and management bonus. At Christmas, Calor pays 
a company bonus, based upon company performance, to the 
majority of employees, whereas the management bonus is linked 
to personal performance and is paid as a percentage of base 
salary. The group that receives the management bonus consists of 
a higher proportion of men and this influences the outcome of the 
median bonus payment.

What next?

At Calor, we treat people fairly. We recruit and promote based on merit alone and will continue 
to support the business to ensure that, regardless of gender, our employees receive the same 
opportunities, recognition and rewards for their contributions.

While the gender pay gap report focuses 
on the diversity of opportunity across 
all of industry, we recognise that we are 
at the start of a journey in the world of 
work and wider society.
We are proud to share that in 2017, 
one third of internal promotions were 
achieved by women while women 
accounted for just one quarter of our 

workforce. We’re also proud to have 
already established a vibrant Equality 
& Diversity (E&D) Council that is 
championing the equality conversation. 
We will continue to work with the E&D 
Council to raise awareness with our 
colleagues and push the agenda for 
equality forwards at Calor.

“Calor’s Equality & Diversity Council is pleased to see the 
gender pay gap is less than the national average. We’d 
like to see this gap reduce and will continue to challenge 
any stereotypes and encourage everyone, and especially 
women, into all levels of the business.”

Corporate Responsibility Manager
