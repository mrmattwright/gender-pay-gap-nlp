Our team knows first-hand how to make education better for schools, pupils and their teachers.  For us, the future of UK education relies upon schools working closely together to share best practices, giving every child the best chance in life. We set up ATT to make this vision a reality.  As a not for profit trust, we work with our growing family of primary and secondary academies, and further education providers in the Midlands, East of England and South East.  Our mission is to provide the very best education for all pupils and the highest level of support for our staff to ensure every child leaves our academies with everything they need to reach their full potential.
