We are working closely with Headteachers to create a model of school-to-school support which we believe will strengthen schools and raise standards. We are excited about the opportunities for church schools and community schools too.  Our schools come in all sizes and serve both rural and urban communities but we are united by a common ethos and determination to provide the best possible learning opportunities for our children.
