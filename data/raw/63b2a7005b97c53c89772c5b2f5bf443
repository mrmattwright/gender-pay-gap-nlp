We have defined four promises that are integral to our company values and our LEGO ® Brand Framework: People Promise, Play Promise, Planet Promise and Partner Promise. In living up to our Promises of leaving a positive impact on children and the world around us, we have set targets to ensure we always maintain our focus and reach our short as well as our long term goals.   UK Gender Pay Gap Report  The LEGO Group has a mission to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow. We create playful learning experiences that develop children to think creatively, reason systematically and realise their potential to shape their own future. We think of all children when we create our fantastic products and seek to adopt the same approach with our workforce.  Our UK Gender Pay Gap Report can be read here .   Committed to United Nations Global Compact  As part of our responsibility strategy, we are an active subscriber to the UN Global Compact and have been so since 2003. We signed the UN Global Compact as the first company in the toy industry. Our participation in the UN Global Compact reflects our commitment to ensuring that the UN Global Compact’s ten principles are integrated into our business operations, conduct and strategies. We embrace and enact values that support human rights, labour, the environment, and anti-corruption.  Each year we publish annual reports concerning our financial- and responsibility performance. Our annual reports provide our stakeholders with information about our approach to responsibility and with transparency of our business conduct.   Responsibility Report Our Responsibility Report accounts for the LEGO Group’s development and activities and serves as our annual Communication on Progress (COP report) as required by the United Nations Global Compact and in accordance with the statutory statement on Corporate Social Responsibility by the Danish Financial Statements Act.  Our report has been inspired by the principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and covers all responsibility activities of the LEGO Group, and it captures our ongoing effort to embed responsibility and sustainability initiatives in our organisational values and strategies.  The 2017 Responsibility Report is split into two parts: our Responsibility Report detailing focus areas and achievements, and the Responsibility Data report containing our non-financial metrics. Both are available here , along with additional supplemental information.  Previous year’s Responsibility Reports are available for downloading here .
