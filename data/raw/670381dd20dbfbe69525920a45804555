Introduction 

Lime Pictures (“Lime”) believes passionately in creating a working environment that is as culturally diverse as 
possible, ensuring that we harness the talent and maximise the potential of all of our people. 

At the time this data snapshot was taken (5 April 2017), Lime’s workforce of both employees and freelance staff 
was made up of 486 people, 55% women, 45% men.   We are proud that more than half our staff and three 
quarters of our senior managers are women.  Nevertheless, like the vast majority of organisations in the UK, 
there is a gap between the average earnings of men and women at Lime Pictures, although at 9% mean and 11% 
median, it is significantly lower than the national averages of 17% and 18% respectively.  

It is also important to note that the Gender Pay Gap is different from ‘Equal Pay’. The Gender Pay Gap is the 
difference between the hourly rate of pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage of the hourly pay rate 
of the men. Equal pay is the difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same or comparable 
jobs.  At Lime Pictures women and men in comparable roles are paid equally.

A number of factors have contributed to our gender pay gap: 

  Overall we have a long serving workforce so the gender pay gap to some extent reflects past employment 

practices 

  We have more women in the lower pay quartiles which tend to be support roles rather than senior specialist 

or managerial roles  

  We have very low turnover among employees which reduces the opportunity for internal progression for 

women coming into the company  

  At the time of the 2017 reporting period there were more men in senior positions: this balance has already 

changed.

Very few people (less than 25) working for Lime are entitled to a contractual bonus: those that are entitled are all 
employees.  We have set out below the percentage of men and women who were entitled to a contractual 
bonus, both as a proportion of overall male and female employees and then as a percentage of overall male and 
females in the workforce.  Given the size of the pool, general percentages should be treated with caution.

We are very pleased that 50% of those within the highest pay quartile are women, however we need to improve 
the proportion of women earners within the second quartile. We do not want fewer women working at Lime and 
therefore would not look to reduce the number of women in the lowest quartile, but we want to make sure that 
women are represented more equally within higher paid crew grades in particular.   
 
We will continue to work with partners to drive greater opportunities for women across all areas of the company 
and to promote other initiatives, locally and more broadly, to encourage career progression amongst women.

What are we doing to address the current gender pay gap? 

  We are continuing to work with industry bodies including PACT and Directors UK to provide opportunities 
for women and other underrepresented groups to have access to jobs and work experience at Lime Pictures. 
  We  are  implementing  performance  review  and  succession  planning  processes  to  enable  us  to  grow  and 
develop our female staff in lower pay percentiles. Over time this should mean that more women progress to 
mid-level and senior roles. 

  We are reviewing our current bonus structures.   
  One of our great strengths is the number of women in senior management positions who provide positive 
role models for women coming into television production generally and Lime Pictures specifically.  We will 
ensure our talented women are visible and able to share their experiences, both internally and throughout 
the industry, by engaging with industry networks, schools and universities. 

  We have an onsite Nursery in Liverpool, which facilitates women returning to work in an industry where long 

and irregular working hours are prevalent. 
 

We confirm that our gender pay gap data has been calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
