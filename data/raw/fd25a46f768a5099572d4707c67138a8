A  Gender  Equality  Gap  Report  which  details  Dover  District  Council’s  gender  pay 
position as at 31 March 2017 must be published by 30 March 2018. It must then be 
reported  &  published  at  least  annually  and  the  information  held  for  3  years.  This

Introduction and Background
The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 (the 
Regulations) require the Council to publish its Gender Pay Gap Report by 30 March 
2018.  This  is  a  matter  for  the  Executive  and  is  presented  for  approval  prior  to 
publication. 

A  relevant  public  authority  must  publish,  for  2017  and  each  subsequent  year,  the 
following information:

the proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower, 
lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands).

The relevant public authority must publish the information required in paragraph 2.2 
within 12 months of the required date. As we are required to report on our position at 
31 March 2017, this must be published by 30 March 2018.

In compiling the information required by paragraph 2.2, the Council is not required to 
include data relating to a relevant employee if:

(a) the employee is employed under a contract personally to do work, and

(b)  the  Council  does  not  have,  and  it  is  not  reasonably  practicable  for  the  public 
authority to obtain, the data.

The requirement is to publish on our website, in a manner which is accessible to all 
employees and the public, for a period of at least 3 years from the date of publication. 
The Council will therefore publish on its own internal intranet site as well as on the 
internet. For Council staff with no access to the intranet, toolbox sessions will be held 
with those particular staff.

The  Regulations  also  require  the  Council  to  publish  the  information  on  a  “website 
designed  for  that  purpose  by  the  Secretary  of  State”.  This  can  be  found  here:

no further comment to add (VB)

Comment  from  the  Solicitor  to  the  Council:  The  Head  of  Legal  Services  has  been 
consulted during the preparation of this report and has no further comment to add.

Comment from the Equalities Officer:  The gender pay gap noted within this report is 
not the result of the Council failing to pay men and women equally, but is due to the 
distribution of men and women within the organisation. Members are reminded that in 
discharging  their  responsibilities  they  are  required  to  comply  with  the  public  sector 
equality  duty  as  set  out 
the  Equality  Act  2010
