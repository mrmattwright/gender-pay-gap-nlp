FOREWORD BY THE MASTER 

On behalf of St Catherine’s Governing Body, I am delighted to present our Equality Report 
for 2016-17. 

At St Catherine’s we are fully committed to promoting equality and diversity for our 
students and staff. Our aim is to be a truly inclusive environment in which individual 
differences are respected and staff and students all have a fair and equal opportunity to 
fulfil their potential. We want to ensure we remove any barriers that may prevent us from 
attracting students or staff of the highest ability. Discrimination on the grounds of age, 
disability, gender reassignment, marital status, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or 
belief, sex (gender), or sexual orientation will not be tolerated. Our equality policy applies to 
all members and visitors to the College, including visiting students, guests, conference 
clients and contractors carrying out work on behalf of the College.  

It is six years since we produced our first Equality Report. Each time we produce a report we 
use it as an opportunity to review its findings against previous reports, enabling us to 
evaluate our current position with regards to equality and diversity, to show us where we 
have made progress, and to identify areas we need to investigate further. In producing this 
year’s report we have reviewed our existing equality objectives and set new equality 
objectives to ensure that we continue to take a proactive approach to the promotion of 
equality of opportunity and that we continue to create an inclusive and fair learning and 
work environment for everyone.  

The Master, Roger W Ainsworth, MA, DPhil, FRAeS, FLSW

INTRODUCTION 

The College 

St Catherine’s College is one of the University of Oxford’s newest colleges. We are one of 38 
independent, self-governing colleges of the University. We started life as a Society in 1868, 
with the aim of encouraging students from less privileged backgrounds to study at Oxford. 
We became a College in 1962 and since then have grown to become one of the largest 
Oxford colleges. We have a student body of 954 students (as at 1 December 2016), which is 
a mixture of undergraduate students, graduate students and visiting students. Some of our 
visiting students stay for a term whilst others study here for an entire academic year. 

Our responsibilities 

For the purposes of this report, we are concentrating on three areas, our roles as: 

•
•
•

an education provider, 
an employer, and 
a provider of conference services. 

As an education provider, we have a responsibility to our students, a responsibility that is at 
the forefront of everything we do. We work hard to ensure that people of the highest ability 
apply to study here and that our students receive the highest quality education, regardless 
of their background. We strive to create a learning and social environment governed by 
equality of opportunity, where diversity is valued. 

As an employer, we are responsible for 185 staff (as at 14 November 2017). In all aspects of 
the employment relationship, we endeavour to ensure equal opportunities for everyone 
and we recognise the benefits having a diverse workforce bring to the College. We want to 
recruit and retain staff of the highest calibre. We believe it is essential that everyone is 
valued and able to work to their full potential, regardless of their background.  

As a provider of conference services, we offer a range of residential and non-residential 
conference facilities. It is important to us that every conference organiser and delegate is 
treated fairly, with consideration and respect. 

The law 

The Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination in employment or in the provision of training 
and education on the grounds of any of the following protected characteristics:  

Age – the legislation applies to people of all ages; this means the young as well as the 
old are protected from discrimination on the basis of their age. Service-related pay 

2 

and benefits are permitted for periods of up to 5 years and these may be specifically 
justified thereafter. 

Disability – disability is defined by the Equality Act as ‘a physical or mental 
impairment which has a substantial and long-lasting effect on a person's ability to 
carry out normal day-to-day activities’. A ‘long-lasting effect’ is one that is likely to 
last 12 months or more, or is likely to recur. ‘Normal day-to-day activities’ might 
include physical activities such as mobility, physical coordination, memory or ability 
to learn, manual dexterity, or speech, hearing or eyesight. Discrimination by 
association is also prohibited, meaning the legislation extends the protection to 
people who are not themselves disabled but are associated with a disabled person. 
For example, it is illegal to discriminate against someone who is not themselves 
disabled but who is the carer of a disabled person. 

Service providers are required to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to any aspect of the 
physical nature of their premises or to any ‘provision, criterion or practice’ that 
places a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage compared with a non-disabled 
person. What count as a ‘reasonable adjustments’ are a matter of context and will 
depend on a range of factors. The duty to make reasonable adjustments only applies 
to those who disabled; therefore, the College is not required to make adjustments 
for people who, for example, are carers of those with disabilities but who are not 
themselves disabled. 

Schedule 13 of the Equality Act prohibits discrimination in relation to school 
admissions, exclusions, and the education or associated services provided to pupils. 
Higher education establishments must also provide auxiliary aids or services, and 
have a duty to make adjustments to physical features. 

Gender reassignment – gender reassignment is a personal, social, and sometimes 
medical process by which a person's gender presentation (the way they appear to 
others) is changed. Anyone who proposes to, starts or has completed a process to 
change his or her gender is protected from discrimination. An individual does not 
need to be undergoing medical supervision to be protected.

Marriage or civil partnership – individuals are protected against discrimination 
relating to their marital status.  

Pregnancy and maternity – a woman is protected from discrimination on the 
grounds of pregnancy and maternity during the period she is pregnant and the 26 
weeks after the birth of a child (the statutory maternity period). 

3 

Race – under the term race a wide definition of race is provided, which includes race, 
colour, nationality, and ethnic or national origin. As a general rule, a group may be 
identified as a race or of the same ethnic origin where the group views itself, and is 
viewed by others, as ‘a distinct community by virtue of certain characteristics’.  

Religion or belief – discrimination on grounds of ‘any religion, religious belief or 
similar philosophical belief’ is prohibited. Neither religion nor belief is defined by the 
law, but it does include the lack of a religion or belief. Political beliefs, however, are 
excluded from the legislation, albeit that the dividing line may be blurred in some 
cases. Factors considered when deciding whether there is a religion or belief may 
include whether there is collective worship, a clear belief system, or a profound 
belief affecting their way of life or view of the world. People are protected from 
discrimination on the grounds of their perceived religion or belief as well as their 
actual religion or belief.  

Sex – both men and women are protected against discrimination by the Equality Act. 
This includes perceived, actual or associated discrimination. 

Sexual orientation – sexual orientation relates to an individual's orientation towards: 
persons of the same gender (gay or lesbian); persons of the opposite gender 
(heterosexual); or persons of both the same gender and opposite gender (bisexual). 
Under the Equality Act, people are also protected from discrimination on the 
grounds of their perceived sexuality as well as their actual sexuality. In addition, it is 
unlawful to discriminate against people on the grounds of their association with 
those of a particular sexual orientation (e.g. friends and/or family). Although people 
are protected from discrimination on the grounds of their religion or belief, it is still 
illegal for them to discriminate against someone else on the grounds of sexual 
orientation (even if, for example, their faith teaches that homosexuality is 
unacceptable). 

The Equality Act does allow for some cases where indirect discrimination is legal, but only 
where the indirect discrimination can be objectively justified as a proportionate means of 
achieving a legitimate aim. 

The Public Sector Equality Duty 

Rather than simply seeking to avoid discrimination, public bodies must consider how they 
could make a more positive contribution to the advancement of equality.

The Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) consists of two parts, the General Equality Duty and 
specific duties governing how public bodies demonstrate that they are meeting the aims of 
the Equality Duty.

4 

The General Equality Duty 
The Equality Act introduced the concept of the general equality duty, which came into force 
in April 2011. This general equality duty covers all the protected characteristics identified in 
the Equality Act. 

The general equality duty has three main aims: 

•

•

•

To eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other 
conduct prohibited by the Equality Act. 

To advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected 
characteristic and those who do not. 

To foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and 
those who do not. 

Specific equality duties 
The Equality Act also introduced a number of specific duties, which mean the College has to: 

•

Fulfil its obligations under the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED), which are to have 
due regard to the aims of the general equality duty in the exercise of our functions.

• Analyse the impact on equality of all our policies and practices.  
•

Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct 
that is prohibited by the Act.  

• Advance equality of opportunity between people who share a characteristic and 

•

those who don't 
Foster good relations between people who share a characteristic and those who 
don't 

• Annually publish information to demonstrate our compliance with the general 

equality duty. This should include information on employees and people affected by 
the College’s services users who share a protected characteristic.  
Publish objectives setting out how we will meet the requirements of the Equality Act, 
at least every four years. 
Ensure the published information and objectives are made available to the public. 
Publish gender pay gap data by 30 March each year.

•

•
•

In terms of disseminating the obligations of PSED throughout the College, it has been agreed 
that The Chair / Secretary of each committee will be responsible for making their respective 
committees aware of its responsibilities under PSED formally on a termly basis.  

5 

Work undertaken by the Equality Committee in 2016/17 

The Equality Committee has addressed the following range of topics in the last year: 
• Review of wording on vacancy advertisements to ensure gender equality was 

maintained 
Integration of disabled students during Freshers’ week 
Student workshops covering racial equality 

•
•

Work undertaken by the student body this year in the area of equality and diversity has 
included a highly successful multicultural Entz, Pride Entz and international students contact 
scheme. 

OUR APPROACH TO EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY 

St Catherine’s is committed to implementing a comprehensive policy of equal opportunities 
for  our  staff  and  students,  in  order  to  provide  an  inclusive  learning,  working  and  social 
environment in which the rights and dignity of all our members are respected. 

Here we provide an overview of our approach and policies relating to equality and diversity. 
More information can be found on the Equal Opportunities pages of our website. 

Our aim 
As part of the wider University of Oxford, at St Catherine’s we work to remove any barriers 
that might deter people of the highest ability from applying to Oxford, either as staff or 
students. We aim to provide an inclusive environment that values diversity and maintains a 
working, learning and social environment in which the rights and dignity of all our staff and 
students are respected to assist them in reaching their full potential. 

Our commitment 

No applicant, student or member of staff will be treated less favourably than any other, 
whether before, during or after their study or employment at St Catherine's on the basis of 
one or more of the following grounds, except when such treatment is within the law and 
determined by lawful requirements: 

age 
colour 

•
•
• disability 
•
ethnic origin 
• marital status 
• nationality 
• national origin 

• parental status 
•
•
•
•
• or length or type of contract (e.g. 

race 
religion or belief  
gender 
sexual orientation; 

part-time or fixed-term) 

6 

Our commitment to our students is to provide education of excellent quality at 
undergraduate and postgraduate level for academically able students, whatever their 
background. In pursuit of this aim, we are committed to using our best endeavours to 
ensure that all of our activities are governed by principles of equality of opportunity, and 
that all students are helped to achieve their full academic potential. This policy applies to 
(but is not limited to) admissions, teaching, learning and research provision, scholarships, 
grants and other awards under the College’s control, student support, College 
accommodation and other facilities, personal conduct and student complaints and 
disciplinary procedures. 

With regard to staff, the policy and practice of the College require that all staff are afforded 
equal opportunities within employment. Entry into (and progression within) employment is 
determined only by personal merit and the application of criteria which are related to the 
duties of the post. In all cases, ability to perform the job is the primary consideration. This 
policy applies to recruitment and selection, training and development, opportunities for 
promotion, conditions of service, pay, facilities, conduct at work, grievance and disciplinary 
procedures, termination of employment, and a number of other areas. 

We are committed to ensuring all our conference delegates and organisers have the same 
excellent experience, regardless of their background. This approach applies to all the 
services and facilities we offer, including meeting and technical facilities, catering and 
accommodation.  

Information in this report 
The data in this report, along with the data collected in future, will inform future decision-
making, equality and diversity policy development and equality and diversity objectives 
throughout the College – in relation to student matters, staff matters and conference 
services. It will also be used as a basis for comparison for future equal opportunity 
monitoring data. 

Student data
Student data relating to admissions, academic performance and equal opportunity 
monitoring is collected at the University-wide level and supplied to individual colleges. We 
do not undertake to collect additional equality-related data from our students.  

The student data in this report has been provided by the University’s Student Data 
Management and Analysis section, and is a snapshot from student data that was correct on 
1 December 2016. 

Where possible, in this report we have compared our data against the data for the 
University of Oxford as a whole to provide some context.  

7 

Staff data 
Staff data in this report comes from two sources: (i) standard information held in staff 
personnel records and (ii) the responses to a staff equal opportunity monitoring form. Equal 
opportunity monitoring forms are issued to staff at least every two years. To encourage 
completion of at least some of the monitoring form, each question contains a ‘prefer not to 
say’ answer option, meaning that staff can choose to provide us with information for each 
protected characteristic the form asks about. All staff are asked to complete a form to assist 
us in gaining an accurate picture of our workforce in relation to protected characteristic 
categories, but completion of the form is not compulsory. 

Equal opportunity monitoring forms were most recently sent to all 185 staff on 20 
November 2017. In 2017, the return rate of the equal opportunity monitoring form was 
65%, an increase in the 54.6% return rate in 2016. The combination of forms not returned 
and forms returned but with individuals opting not to give information means there was an 
‘unknown’ element of 51.3% for some protected characteristics. 

We collect data on the majority of protected characteristics covered by the Equality Act but 
we limit the information we publish in this report to gender, age, disability and ethnicity. 
This is because we are a relatively small and close-knit community and as such, there is a 
high risk individuals may be identified if some data were published. 

In producing this report, the staff data were compared to staff data in the equality reports 
available online of other public sector employers based in Oxford. The employers we chose 
to look at were those who face similar challenges and have a comparable breadth of job 
types.  

Also included in this report are equal opportunities monitoring data for all job vacancies 
advertised in 2017. Applicants are asked to complete the equal opportunities monitoring 
form as part of the application process; return of the form is on a voluntary basis. Some 
academic appointments are joint appointments with the University, and the College is not 
the lead employer. Equal opportunities monitoring data collected for these vacancies are 
not available to us and therefore have not been included in the figures reported here. 

In the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017, we advertised 36 non-academic posts 
and received a total of 948 applicants. 27% of applicants for non-academic posts returned 
our equal opportunities monitoring form, a significantly lower return rate than we had in 
previous years. We advertised nine academic vacancies in the period 1 January 2017 to 31 
December 2017 and received a total of 120 applications for these posts. 76% of applicants 
for academic posts returned our equal opportunities monitoring form.

How we will deliver our duties 
The College has an Equality Committee, which meets once a term (three times per year). It 
is chaired by the Home Bursar, and Committee members include College Officers, staff, and 
representatives from the undergraduate and graduate student bodies. It is important to us 
that people from different areas of the College are involved in the Equality Committee and 
that the views of both staff and students (undergraduate and graduate) are represented at 
Committee meetings. Since the publication of our first Equality Report, we have widened 
the membership of the Equality Committee and we remain committed to further extending 
the membership of the Committee to other members of the College who feel they can 
contribute to the analysis of what we do and help formulate our developing policies. 

It is the responsibility of the Equality Committee to oversee the development of Equal 
Opportunities policy frameworks and objectives and their application in the College, 
working as appropriate with the relevant colleagues and bodies. The Committee is also 
responsible for reviewing equal opportunity data collected by the College and for ensuring 
that there is a forum at which student views on any matters relating to equality and equal 
opportunities can be raised. 

Representatives of St Catherine’s also attend the College Equality and Diversity Forum 
organised by the Conference of Colleges, which enables good practice to be shared between 
colleges. 

The College works continuously to identify and address any areas of concern, to ensure that 
our existing policies, procedures and practices are reviewed, and to identify any further 
areas that can be improved as part of this ongoing process. Through the Equality Committee 
and other mechanisms, we aim to review and report on our progress in ensuring that 
students and staff experience a consistently inclusive and supportive environment to assist 
them in reaching their full potential. We always welcome feedback and suggestions – from 
students, staff, potential students and visitors – as we endeavour to ensure that what we do 
is meaningful, focussed on the right priorities and will have a real impact on the experience 
of members of the College, visitors and other interested parties. 

Decision making 
Committee Chairs and Secretaries are asked to pre-screen the agenda routinely for any 
items that might have implications under the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED).  The PSED 
requires the College to have ‘due regard’ to the potential and actual impact on equality of 
all their policies, procedures, decisions, informal practices, etc.  (See 
https://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/eop/policy/framework/.)  Where an item has potential 
implications under the PSED this should be indicated on the agenda, and an equality analysis
may be enclosed with the agenda and papers (see Checklist for recording steps and 
outcomes under https://www1.admin.ox.ac.uk/eop/policy/data/analysis/guidance/.)   

9 

The committee may request these issues to be considered in relation to any item.  The 
discussion of any item identified as having PSED implications should include consideration of 
the following: Is the decision likely to affect people with ‘protected characteristics’ 
differently? Which protected group(s) might be affected? Are there any means of remedying 
or mitigating a potential negative impact?  If there are no remedies, can the negative impact 
be justified? Could the decision have a positive impact on equality?  If it is not self-evident 
that the PSED is not relevant to a particular item then the reasons why it is not considered 
relevant should be recorded in the minutes.   

OUR EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY DATA 

As an educator 

Where we are 
As at 1 December 2016, we had 954 students based at St Catherine’s, of which 48 were 
visiting students. 

Gender

The gender split in the student body was 43% female (412) to 57% male (542). This is similar 
to the gender split within the student body of the University as a whole, which is 45% 
(10,536) female to 55% male (12,659). It is also similar to the gender split for the previous 
two years in both the College and the University: 2015: 45% female (405) to 55% male (503) 
for the College and 46 % female (10,361) to 54% male (12,241) for the University as a whole; 
2014: 44% female (372) to 56% male (470) for the College and 45% female (10,148) to 55% 
male (12,200) for the University as a whole.

Subject division 

If the gender split is broken down into subject division, the area where there is the largest 
imbalance is in the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences (MPLS), with 25% female 
students (72) compared to 75% male students (214). The figures are similar at the wider 
University level, with MPLS having 28% female students and 72% male students in 2016. 
The gender split for Social Sciences students was more equal, with 47% female students 
(110) and 53% male students (125). This has been the same for the last three years both 
within the College and at the University level.  

The proportion of female Humanities students is slightly lower in 2016 than in the previous 
two years, standing at 57% female (100) to 43% male (76). It was 61% female (101) to 39% 

12 

male (64) in 2015 and 60% female (102) to 40% male (68) in 2014. The proportion of female 
Humanities students was higher at the University level as well (56% female to 44% male 
students in 2016). 
The proportion of female students studying Medical Sciences has shown an upward trend 
since 2013, with 51% female students (71) to 49% male students (68) in 2016. At the 
University level, the proportion of female students has also shown a slight upward trend in 
the last three years, with 53% female in 2016. 

The proportion of female Oxford University Department for Continuing Education (OUDCE) 
students has remained relatively consistent over the last three years. Currently it is 49% 
female students (34) to 51% male students (36). At the University level, there were 53.3% 
female students in 2016. 

Ethnicity 

67% (647) of our students are from a White ethnic background (British, Irish or any other 
White background), whilst 30% (281) of our students declared themselves to be from a 
Black or Ethnic Monitory (BME) background. The information on ethnicity is unknown or 
undeclared for 3% (26) of our students. 

The percentage of unknowns for student ethnicity has increased slightly since 2015, 
however the trend over the last three years has shown a decrease in the number of 
unknowns.  

For the University of Oxford as a whole, figures are similar. 71% of its student population are 
from a White ethnic background and 26% are from a BME background.

Year

We are part of a world-renowned university and therefore we attract a large number of 
overseas students. However, if international students are excluded from the ethnicity 
figures the College still compares well with the University. In 2016 the ethnic background of 

13 

UK students in College was 81% (430) White, 17% (92) BME and 2% (12) unknown. For the 
University the figures were 83% White, 15% BME and 2% unknown. 

Disability 

10% (94) of our student population declared themselves to have a disability, which included 
3% (25) who identified themselves as specifically having a learning disability. The percentage 
of students declaring a disability has shown an upward trend since 2013. In 2015, 10% (93) 
of students declared a disability, of which 4% (35) had a learning disability. In 2014 8% (69) 
of students declared a disability, of which 4% (32) had a learning disability, whilst in 2013 8% 
(63) of students declared a disability, of which 3% (28) had a learning disability.  

Our figures are similar to those available for the University as a whole, where 11% of 
students declared a disability, including 4% who defined their disability as being a learning 
disability. 

It is worth noting that ‘disability’ covers a wide range of conditions, and whilst someone 
may have a condition that traditionally would be covered by term ‘disability’, they may not 
consider themselves to be disabled and so will not declare their disability. Students with 
learning disabilities have an incentive to declare their disability, for example to ensure that 
they receive additional time in examinations to which they are entitled. Students with a 
physical disability are encouraged to disclose it at application and registration. Students may 
also make the College aware through other channels to enable any necessary adjustments 
to be made or additional support to be given.  

The College intends to address any imbalances with regard to equality and diversity in the 
above data during the course of Equality Committee meetings during the coming year.  

As an employer 

Where we are 
On 17 November 2017, the total number of staff at St Catherine’s was 185. Of the 185 staff, 
36% were academic and teaching staff (including Fellows) and 64% were professional and 
support services staff. The number of staff has increased by 10 people since 31 December 
2015. The percentage of academic and teaching staff has increased slightly and professional 
and support services staff has decreased slightly. 

Gender 

The gender profile of our workforce as a whole is 50% female and 50% male. The academic 
workforce is 27% female and 73% male. The professional and support services workforce is 
63% female and 37% male. In 2015, the gender profile of our workforce was 50% female 

14 

and 50% male. The academic workforce was 29% female and 71% male. The professional 
and support services workforce was 60.2% female and 39.7% male. 

We have compared our overall gender profile to the equality profile information published 
by other public sector employers within the boundaries of Oxford city and have found our 
overall gender profile to be more balanced than most of those employers. Figures from the 
2011 census show that women comprise 47% of the economically active population aged 16 
to 74 and 47% of those in employment (42% of job seekers).

We compared the gender profile of academic staff against the figures published by the 
University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, both of which had a very similar 
gender profile for academic staff.  

Applications for vacancies 
Of the applicants for non-academic posts who returned the equal opportunities monitoring 
form in 2017, 62% were female and 36% were male (2% unknown).  

Of the applicants for academic vacancies who completed our equal opportunities 
monitoring form in 2017, 35% were female and 60% were male (5% unknown). 

Gender Pay Gap 

The College’s gender pay gap (the difference between average pay earned by female 
employees and average pay earned by male employees) is based on a snapshot date of 5 
April 2017, and is as follows:

Ethnicity

In 2017, 51% of the workforce declared themselves to be from a White ethnic background 
(British, Irish or any other White background). 11% of the workforce declared themselves to 
be from a Black or Ethnic Minority (BME) background, which is similar to the Higher 
Education sector as a whole (11.7% in 2015), but lower than the economically active 

15 

population of  the City of Oxford (19% in 2011)). The information on ethnicity was unknown 
or undeclared for 38% of staff. 

It is difficult to make observations regarding the ethnicity profile of our workforce given that 
38% chose not to provide us with that information. However, the number of staff choosing 
not to supply this information has decreased; the unknown/undeclared figure was 46% in 
2016. It is possible that staff were more encouraged to complete the equal opportunities 
monitoring forms in 2017, as background information on the importance of gathering 
meaningful data was communicated to them ahead of the forms.  

Applications for vacancies 

Of the applicants for non-academic vacancies who completed our equal opportunities 
monitoring form in 2017, 81% declared themselves to be from a White ethnic background 
and 17% from a BME background.  

Of the applicants for academic vacancies who completed our equal opportunities 
monitoring form in 2017, 70% declared themselves to be from a White ethnic background 
and 24% from a BME background.  

Disability
Only 3% of staff declared a disability, with 58% of staff declaring they did not have a 
disability. The information is unknown for the remaining 39% of staff. 

Whilst having 3% of staff with a declared disability may seem low, staff members were 
asked whether they considered themselves to have a disability. ‘Disability’ covers an 
extremely wide range of conditions, and whilst someone may have a condition that 
traditionally would be covered by term ‘disability’, they may not consider themselves to be 
disabled.  

Applications for vacancies 
Of the applicants for non-academic vacancies who completed our equal opportunities 
monitoring form in 2017, 1% declared themselves to have a disability.  

Of the applicants for academic vacancies who completed our equal opportunities 
monitoring form in 2017, 4% declared themselves to have a disability.

Our proportion of employees between the ages of 16 and 25 is lower than that of other 
local public sector employers.  

Applications for vacancies 
Of the applicants for non-academic vacancies who completed our equal opportunities 
monitoring form in 2017, the largest age band was for applicants aged 21–25 (28%). This 
was in contrast to previous years, in which the largest age band was applicants aged 26-30. 
We had a low number of applicants who identified themselves as being in the age bands 16-
20 (2%), 56-60 (4%), 61–65 (1%) and received no applications from people in the age bands 
66+.  

Of the applicants for academic vacancies who completed our equal opportunities 
monitoring form in 2017, the largest age band was for applicants aged 31–35 (27%). This is 
in contrast to the largest group in 2015, which comprised applicants aged 26-30. We had a 
low number of applicants from people in the age bands 56-60 (1%) and 61-65 (2%) and 
received no applications from people in the age bands 16–20 and 66+.  

As a provider of conference services  

The services we provide as a venue for conferences include: 

• Meeting/lecture spaces – Our conference facilities include a number of meeting 
rooms and lecture halls suitable for group discussions, presentations or lectures.  

• Accommodation – We can accommodate over 410 delegates staying with us on 

residential conferences. Two hundred and fifty of our rooms have en-suite facilities. 
We have 46 ground-floor bedrooms, all with en-suite shower rooms, three of which 
are specially adapted for wheelchair access.
Food – We can provide breakfast, lunch and/or dinner for our conference guests, 
catering for any special dietary requirements, whether they are for medical, religious 

•

17 

or personal reasons. Individual conference organisers are able to request changes to 
menus in advance.  

• Access and parking – We have excellent access and facilities for people with 

disabilities and/or special requirements. The College is mainly built on ground level, 
and there is easy wheelchair access to all areas, including the Lodge, the Dining Hall, 
the Lecture Theatre, the Library, the MCR, and the whole of the JCR area, including 
the bar and computer room. We have an on-site car park and parking spaces are 
made available to any conference delegates with mobility issues. 

Public Sector Equality Duty Aims and objectives  
The public sector duties set out in the Equality Act require us to set and publish objectives in 
relation to meeting the requirements of the Equality Act.  

The aims and objectives we have set in relation to our role as an educator, employer and 
conference provider are listed below, together with additional objectives for 2018. 

Improve the representation of under-represented groups across the College’s functions. 

Our data show our female student population has decreased slightly this year, having 
steadily increased over the previous three years, and now stands at 43%, compared to 
population of the University of Oxford at (45%). The Equality Committee will continue to 
review and discuss the gender figures. 

We will continue to aim to gather data regarding applications as well as admissions to the 
College in the subject area of the largest gender imbalance, MPLS. This information can be 
used to inform strategies to improve the gender balance within these subject areas. 

Improve accessibility and support to people with disabilities. 

To encourage and sustain progress, we will keep a record of improvements that have been 
made to the College in terms of accessibility and/or support offered to students, staff and 
conference guests with disabilities. Records continue to be kept in Equality Committee 
meeting minutes and on the College website. 

We will consider periodically whether there is a need to review any of the conference 
services we provide with respect to equality and/or diversity. 

18 

Improve equality monitoring of the protected groups within the workforce. 

The collection of equal opportunity monitoring data depends on the willingness of staff to 
complete the form. To get the full picture about our staff and protected characteristics, we 
need all staff to return equal opportunity monitoring forms when they are issued. A 
significantly higher proportion of staff returned the monitoring form in 2017 (65%) than in 
2016 (54.6%). We will aim to improve the return rate of equal opportunity monitoring forms 
further in future years. This will include looking at the way forms are issued and returned, as 
well as supporting information provided to staff, to see if changes to these processes will 
result in a higher return rate. 

In terms of staff recruitment, as part of the application process, all applicants are asked to 
complete our equal opportunity recruitment monitoring form, but not all applicants return 
them. We would like to be in a position where we have the fullest picture of the applicants 
we are attracting. In 2017, the proportion of applicants for non-academic appointments 
returning forms decreased significantly (27%). In previous years, the return rate has been 
higher, at 57% in 2015 and 67% in 2014. This could be explained by the use of a vacancy 
website which enables candidates to apply through an online portal, rather than via the 
College website. The return rate for academic vacancies has remained high (76% in 2017, 
79% in 2015 and 76% in 2014).  

There is still room for improvement in all areas, particularly in getting applicants applying for 
non-office-based roles to return the equal opportunity recruitment monitoring form. 
Therefore, we will continue to encourage all applicants to complete the equal opportunity 
monitoring form during the recruitment process.  

We will continue to review the details of job vacancies (e.g. job description, further 
particulars, job titles, duties) when they arise to ensure there is no unintended bias in any 
element of the details. We will also review new policies and procedures before 
implementation to ensure that there are no unintended consequences for or bias against a 
particular group as a result of the policy or procedure. 

For a number of our academic appointments, we are not the primary employer, and so we 
do not coordinate the recruitment process and do not have access to the equal opportunity 
recruitment monitoring information collected. This means that we do not get the complete 
picture in terms of applicants for academic vacancies. In past years, we have contacted the 
‘lead’ employer to ask for this data to be shared with us. So far, our efforts have been 
unsuccessful, but we will continue to investigate ways of trying to obtain the equal 
opportunity recruitment monitoring information in cases where we are not the primary 
employer. 

19 

Develop appropriate methods of consulting effectively with the protected groups within 
our student population, workforce and conference service. 

As well as considering new methods of consultation, we will continue to consider how the 
Equality Committee membership can be extended to gain a wider variety of staff and 
student views.  

We will continue to consider whether there is a need to amend the feedback forms we use 
for conference guests, to include equality and diversity data. 

Additional Public Sector Equality Duty objectives for 2018: 

We will consider new ways of encouraging disclosure of protected characteristics, to assist 
in promoting a culture of positive awareness in relation to all protected characteristics.  

We will seek to promote a deeper understanding of equality and fairness across the College 
through the provision of equality and diversity training for staff.
