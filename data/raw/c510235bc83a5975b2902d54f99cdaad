Our gender pay gap reflects the average paid to men and women across our UK business. It is not a comparison of pay rates for men and women doing work of equal value.  While women make up the majority of our UK workforce and a significant proportion of senior positions, more of our most senior (and therefore highest paid) people are currently male, a factor that influences both our gender pay and bonus gaps.  CVS’ median gender pay gap for our two largest groups of employees, vets and nurses, is 10.9% for vets and -10.3% for nurses.  CVS’ total median gender pay gap is 45.1%*, given that the UK’s median gender pay is 18.4%**, so CVS’ gender pay gap for vets and nurses is better than the national average. The overall CVS difference compared to the national average primarily reflects the greater proportion of male employees in senior roles. We recognise that there is considerable work to be done in this area.  At CVS (UK) Limited we are committed to the diversity and inclusion agenda. You can read more about what we are doing to address our gender pay and bonus gaps at the end of this report.
