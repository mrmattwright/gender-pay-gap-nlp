Local. Personal.  The HML Group is a provider of property management, insurance and ancillary services. HML floated on London's AIM stock exchange in June 2006. The Group plans to follow a strategy of growth both organically and by acquisition, in order to fulfill its ambition of establishing HML as a national brand in the property services market .  The HML group has over 50 years’ experience in Property Management. The Group currently supplies a range of bluechip clients as well as over 60,000 residential and residential units .  To date, HML has grown principally through acquisitions which have been structured geographically to create hubs of local property management operations throughout the Greater London region and beyond. Our flexible, personal approach ensures client satisfaction because we understand each property is different and unique. We have a number of strategically placed offices, spanning the UK from north to south and east to west to cater for our existing, and growing, customer base .                        What we do  Our primary concern is looking after your property as if it were our own  We have been looking after properties for over 50 years - homes just like yours - providing expertise and attention to detail, which reassures property owners and meets all relevant lease and legislative requirements.

We look to source local contractors; keeping costs down for our clients whilst supporting local enterprise and community wellbeing.  We run our business in accordance with our mission statement; all of which go hand in hand with our business statement and values.    download our CSR statement          Committed to Equal Opportunity  As CEO of The HML Group, I am proud to be voluntarily choosing to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation. The Gender Pay reporting is not the same as 'Equal Pay' for men and women doing equivalent jobs across our business. For this area I know already that our women and men are paid equally.  As a committed equal opportunity employer I have chosen to carry out this analysis now so that we can enact clear actions to reduce the gender pay gap. The report illustrates the gender distribution across the HML Group in four equally sized quartiles. It can be seen that the 2017 our average (mean) gender pay gap is at 19%. This is in line with the National average and it is clear from the data that the gender imbalance lies within the top quartile of the business.  My aim is to achieve a 50:50 gender balance by 2025 (within a 5% tolerance) and I have set specific objectives to address the imbalance within the top quartile of our business. I believe it is now more important than ever to address the inequality of the gender pay gap. I am delighted to introduce new guidelines to ensure a fairer future.   -Rob Plumb CEO, The HML Group    For further details on how we intend to achieve this objective:  Read more                    There are lots of great reasons to join HML  find out more                          job seeker    find a job    submit your cv    areas of expertise        areas of expertise    accountancy and finance    construction & property    education            employers    accountancy and finance    construction & property    business support        our solutions    inhouse services    MSP & RPO    search and selection    delivery solutions            workforce360    attracting & recruiting talent    managing fulfilment at work    emerging workforce trends        career hub    building your career    cv and interview advice    finding the right job            jobs at Randstad    our current vacancies    new to recruitment    experienced recruiter    head office and support roles        about us    our history    our sponsorships    press releases          follow us    LinkedIn    Youtube    Facebook    Twitter         about this website    terms & conditions   cookies        Development and Hosting by Bit Agency            Home    Welcome to HML    Our history    Why we are different    What's available to you    Vacancies    Our locations    Apprentices
