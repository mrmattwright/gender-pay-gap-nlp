We recognise that all our colleagues are unique –whatever their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other ideologies, and that by valuing each other and working in collaboration we build a team of forward thinking individuals that help make our business a success.  We have a mean gender pay gap of 31.79% and a median gender pay gap of 29.25%, both above the national average. We know our gender pay gap is not a pay issue but is a consequence of there being a significantly higher proportion of women than men in more junior roles and fewer women than men in leadership positions. We are committed to reducing the gaps whilst maintaining our focus on individual capability.
