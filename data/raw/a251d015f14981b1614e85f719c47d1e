Neal’s Yard Remedies Gender Pay Gap Report 2016-2017     We aim to be a fair employer offering all employees equal opportunity to develop to their full potential regardless of gender.  By law employers with 250 or more employees are required to publish gender pay gap information each year. We welcome this initiative.  Our mean (average) gender pay gap is 10%. This is significantly better than the UK average gender pay gap, which is provisionally 17.4%.  We recognise that there is still room for improvement and we are proud to have six women and three men on our board of directors who are working hard to close our gender pay gap as a high priority.     What is the gender pay gap?   A gender pay gap is the difference between the average of all women’s and the average of all men’s earnings, expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.  Our pay gap is calculated by taking the average pay of all men working in the company, and comparing it with the average pay of all women working woman in the company. The difference between the two averages is our pay gap.     Does a gender pay gap mean that women are not being paid the same as men for doing the same jobs?   No, but this is a common misconception. Paying a man and a woman differently when they do the same or equivalent work is unlawful under the equality legislation.  When a company has a gender pay gap it does not mean that men and women who do the same job are being paid differently.  Whilst the minority of employees in the business are men, they happen to be employed in higher paid jobs. The concentration of a small number of men in such jobs causes the average male salary to be higher than the average female salary.  There is no difference in hourly pay rates between the genders in our factory and retail teams although we employ fewer males than females in retail.     Our Results   At Neal’s Yard Remedies, 80% of our whole team is female. 57% of our total employees work within our stores, consequently most of our Retail team are women.      Our Gender Pay Gap   Our mean* (average) gender pay gap is 10%. The UK average gender pay gap is provisionally 17.4%.  *Mean average is the difference between the average of all men’s and all women’s pay achieved when all the rates are added together and divided by the number of males and females.  Our median** gender pay gap is 4%. The UK median gender pay gap is provisionally 18.4%.  **Median is the difference between the mid points in the ranges of men’s and women’s pay achieved by taking the middle figure when the amounts are put in the order of smallest to largest.     Pay Quartiles   These graphics show the percentage of men and women within each pay quartile at Neal’s Yard Remedies:   The Pay Quartiles show that the proportion of women mostly reflects the makeup of our business across the quartiles.     Bonus Pay Gap   Bonus payments include commission earned in store. Our figures show that slightly more women than men received bonuses:   Comparing the mean bonus amounts paid, women received a bonus which on average was 57% higher than men.  The median bonus paid was also 13% higher for women.     What we can do better?   We already have a strong leadership team, the majority of whom are female, and we will continue to support the development and progression of both women and men throughout the business as we work to close the gender pay gap.
