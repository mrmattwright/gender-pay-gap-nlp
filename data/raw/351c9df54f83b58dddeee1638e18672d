Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

What is the gender pay gap?
The  gender  pay  gap  is  a  measure  of  the  difference  between  the  average  earnings  of  men  and 
women across an organisation. The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay, which relates to 
men and women being paid equally for equal work. Equal pay is a legal requirement in the UK and 
Pendragon already abides by this.

Legislative Requirements
All UK companies, with over 250 team members on 5 April 2017 are required to report on their 
gender pay gap, and publish the following specific gender pay information:-

•  Mean and median gender pay gap;

•  Mean and median gender bonus gap;

•   Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus;

•   Proportion of males and females by quartile pay band.

Figures for each legal entity with at least 250 team members must be calculated and reported 
separately.  

The mean and median gender pay gap is based on hourly rates of pay as at 5 April 2017.  

The mean and median gender bonus gap considers bonus pay received in the 12 months leading 
up to 5 April 2017. 

Pay quartiles look at the proportion of men and women in four pay bands when we divide our 
workforce into four equal parts.

Our Company
Pendragon PLC is comprised of a number of different companies. This report looks at the gender 
pay  gap  across  the  combined  Pendragon  Group.  Subsidiary  entities  with  more  than  250  team 
members are reported on separately, as required at the end of this report. Pendragon employs 
9,989 team members of which 25% are female.

What is our approach to the gender pay gap at Pendragon?
The requirement to report on the gender pay gap within Pendragon supports our ethos of treating 
all our team members equally and with respect. Improving the diversity and inclusion of our team 
members remains a strategic focus of our People Strategy, as we continue to build and develop a 
culture that attracts talented individuals who can be themselves regardless of gender. 

However we do recognise that in relation to pay, a gap exists between genders where we have 
fewer women in senior roles. This is reflective of the wider motor industry. Pendragon is working 
hard to redress this imbalance across our businesses, changing working practices and patterns to 
appeal to a wider demographic reflecting our diverse customer base. We are active ambassadors 
of the motor industry, raising awareness of the vast opportunities our business and the industry 
has to offer to female talent.

Automotive retail has historically been a male dominated sector, which, unsurprisingly, is reflected 
in our split between male and female team members:

Difference in median Hourly rate of pay

Mean and Median Gender Pay Gap
The mean gender pay gap is the difference in average hourly rates of pay that female and male 
team members receive. This gives an overall indication of the gender pay gap by taking all hourly 
rates of pay and dividing by the total number of team members in scope.

The median gender pay gap shows the difference in the midpoints of the ranges of hourly rates of 
pay for men and women by ordering individual rates of pay from lowest to highest and comparing 
the middle value.

Both mean and median gender pay gap is expressed as the difference in the average pay of all 
male and female team members across the Pendragon Group as a percentage of men’s pay.

This is the percentage of male and female team members in four quartile pay bands (dividing our 
workforce into four equal parts).

Why do we have a gender pay gap at Pendragon?
As mentioned, the automotive retail sector is historically a male dominated sector. The gender pay 
gap at Pendragon is not as a result of our pay policies and practices, but rather having a higher 
proportion of women than men in our more junior or entry level roles paid lower salaries, and fewer 
women than men in our senior and management roles, paid higher salaries. 

Why do we have a gender bonus gap at Pendragon?
As with the gender pay gap, the gender bonus gap between male and female team members is 
mainly due to the structure of our workforce. We currently have more men in senior roles and also 
working in our dealerships where bonus remains a core part of remuneration, particularly for sales 
team members. When structural factors such as these are removed, differences in bonus can be 
mainly attributed to differences in individual performance, experience and skill sets.

Gender pay gap by quartile
These charts highlight the under representation of female team members in senior roles across our 
businesses as shown by the lowest percentage of females in the upper quartile. The lower quartiles 
are predominantly made up of dealership roles on spot basic salaries regardless of gender. 

02.2018 - C5078 Gender Pay Report  Our Commitment to Closing the Gap

At Pendragon, we continue to progress our approach to making the business more attractive and 
accessible to a wider demographic, including female talent. As we continue to focus our efforts on 
ensuring men and women are represented equally at all levels in our business, the gender pay gap 
will close.

However, although we are impatient to deliver change, we recognise that eliminating the gender 
pay gap will take time, and no single action can eliminate it overnight.

Recruitment
We continue to seek the best candidates from all backgrounds to apply for roles at all levels in 
Pendragon, and it is important that we take into account all perspectives in order to get the best 
person for the role. 

•   We  have  introduced  new  customer  facing  roles  and  more  flexible  part  time  roles  that  are 

attracting more female applicants to our dealerships

•   We continuously scrutinise our recruitment and selection processes and advertisements to 

ensure we attract a diverse range of applicants

Training, Development and Progression
We  will  continue  to  encourage  female  team  members  to  progress  their  career  with  Pendragon, 
ensuring our talent process helps us identify, support and equip women to feel ready to move into 
more senior roles in the future. 

In Pinewood, our IT business, we have a successful approach to female recruitment with supported 
development career paths and training programmes which encourage more females to join and 
progress  their  career  with  us.  Early  indications  are  positive,  with  the  proportion  of  female  team 
members  now  over  30%  in  another  gender  biased  sector.  Again  this  will  take  time  but  we  look 
forward to reporting on progress from a gender pay perspective in future years. 

Retention
It  is  becoming  increasingly  difficult  to  balance  work  and  home  commitments,  and  providing 
support to retain the team members with the skills we need in our businesses is becoming more 
fundamental to our ongoing success. We will continue to explore smarter and more flexible ways of 
working to meet the needs of our team members, with a view to increasing our retention of female 
talent. 

We  recognise  that  it  will  take  time  to  correct  the  historic  bias  that  automotive  retail  has 
experienced  over  several  decades.  We  are  confident  that  our  approaches  will  increase  the 
proportion  of  female  team  members  recruited  or  progressing  to  senior  roles  going  forward, 
although  in  the  short  term  we  will  potentially  see  the  gender  pay  gap  increase  as  we  recruit  
more females into entry level roles.
