Key Facts about this Report

• The Equality Act 2010 Regulations 2017 
requires organisations with over 250 UK-
based employees to publish their gender 
pay gap by April 2018.

• Gender Pay Reporting involves six 

calculations that show the difference 
between the average earnings of men and 
women based in the UK in our organisation:  

1. Average gender pay gap as a 

mean average

2. Average gender pay gap as a 

median average

3. Proportion of males and females 

when divided into four groups 
ordered from lowest to highest pay
4. Average bonus gender pay gap as 

a mean average

5. Average bonus gender pay gap as 

a median average

6. Proportion of males receiving a 

bonus payment and proportion of 
females receiving a bonus 
payment

• Data for all pay grades is analysed; 

individual data is not published. 

•

It is a different calculation to equal pay, 
which requires men and women to be paid 
the same for carrying out the same job, 
similar jobs or work of equal value.

Zebra recognises that our employees’ passion and commitment enables Zebra to achieve our mission and vision to create a smarter, more 
connected business community through innovative products and solutions that enable visibility.  

We believe that diversity and inclusion is key to helping us attract, motivate and retain top talent. 

Our Total Rewards Programme is based on market-driven salaries and incentive targets as well as programmes to support and encourage 
career development and professional growth across diverse groups.  

By monitoring the pay gap between men and women we can better understand the gap and target action to reduce it.

Understanding the Numbers

•

In Zebra, the mean hourly pay for women is 18.6% lower than for men.  This 
compares to the National average of 18% and 25% in the High Tech sector*.  

• The gender pay gap is different to equal pay where men and women are paid the 
same for carrying out work of equal value. When we compare pay for equal work, 
we meet our equal pay obligations.

• Like the High Tech sector in which 74% of the workforce is male*, the gap is 

caused by the representation of women within the organisation in which today 
30% are female and 70% are male. The under-representation of women in 
certain roles like Sales also contributes to the bonus pay gap. 

• While we’re making progress, we look forward to accelerating our efforts through 
the formalization of an Inclusion & Diversity program this year that will focus first 
on gender.
