Pay quartiles by gender      Band    Males    Females    Description        A    55.56%    44.44%    Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile      B    42.62%    57.38%    Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at or below the median      C    48.39%    51.61%    Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile      D    54.10%    45.90%    Includes all employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile      The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  Explaining NCL’s gender pay report  Equal pay and the gender pay gap both deal with the disparity of pay that women receive in the workplace. Under the law, men and women must receive equal pay for:   the same or broadly similar work;  work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or  work of equal value.   The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across the same organisation or the labour market as a whole. In Britain, there is currently a gender pay gap of 18.1% (source: Equality and Human Rights Commission).  NCL is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. We have a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). As such, we:   carry out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals;  evaluate job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure;  work to set pay structures to ensure there is no unfairness of pay.   We are showing a fairly equal balance in pay between genders at the lower pay quartiles. In the upper pay quartiles, the gender pay gap is showing positive results for female workers.  In addition, the majority of NCL’s workforce is from our active leisure division, where nearly 49% of workers are female. Within the leisure division, some of the most highly paid roles based on an hourly rate are Fitness Class Instructors, Gymnastics/Trampoline Coaches and Swimming Teachers and 79% of these roles are held by females.  In many organisations across the UK, men are currently more likely than women to be in senior roles which is also reflected within Senior Management Teams and in our Leisure Division where circa 33% of management and leadership roles are held by females. NCL is keen to continue to increase this percentage and, in particular, to assist our pipeline of female managers to achieve progression to the highest levels of the organisation. We will continue to focus on development initiatives to support this and will continue to deliver key programmes such as our well-established Management Academies and Trainee Manager development programmes.
