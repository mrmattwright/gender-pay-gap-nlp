Brookson Solutions Limited Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
Introduction 

From 2017, any organisation that has at least 250 employees who are based in England, Scotland or 
Wales must publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is the 
difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings. 
The figures must be calculated using a specific reference date, called the ‘snapshot date’. The snapshot 
date for businesses and charities is 5 April each year. As such, this report is for the period 5th April 
2016 – 4th April 2017. 

It is worth being clear at this point that these gender pay gap measures are not a representation of 
equal pay. 

The reporting requirements  

•  Average gender pay gap as a mean average 
•  Average gender pay gap as a median average 
•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average 
•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average 
•  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a bonus 

payment 

•  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest to highest 

pay (Pay Quartiles).

Written Statement 

Evidently the contracting market is heavily male dominated with only 21.5% of Brookson Solutions 
Limited’s contractors being female. This may be due to familial circumstances and women prioritising 
job security and regular income that comes with employment rather than contracting. Contractors are 
inherently at risk of there being times where there is no work available, or that their services are not 
required. Fundamentally this limits the number of people who choose to operate as a contractor. 

Generally, contractors source their work on their own or via a recruitment agency, as such and due to 
the nature of an Umbrella Company, Brookson Solutions Limited has little involvement in the rates 
agreed  for  the  services  provided.  Brookson  Solutions  Limited  entrust  that  recruiters  have  the 
necessary understanding of current market relevant rates for the services provided by contractors. 

How we will reduce the Gap 

Going forward we will continue to work with recruitment agencies in order to ensure adequate and 
equal pay rates are negotiated for our contractors. We are committed to ensuring accessibility to all 
contracting roles and recognise the need to attract the most talented individual for a role regardless 
of gender.
