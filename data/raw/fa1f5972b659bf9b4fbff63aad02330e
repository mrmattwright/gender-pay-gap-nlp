BJSS continues to thrive and grow because we are always looking for ways to make BJSS attractive to the broadest possible range of candidates. We are committed to continuing to increase the diversity of the BJSS team, including improving the gender balance in the organisation, which will in turn positively impact our gender pay gap.
