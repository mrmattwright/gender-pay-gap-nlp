The data analysed for this report relates to the snapshot date of 5 April 2017 and the difference between bonus payments made in the 12 months preceding the 5 April 2017.    Brooks Bros supports the decision to formalise and standardise the way in which gender pay reporting is carried out, providing a transparent measure of progress and help to determine what actions need to be taken to address any underlying causes of gender inequality.    As a company we are committed to actions and initiatives to break down barriers and develop all staff.    Pay difference between men and women at Brooks Bros (UK) Ltd:          Mean Gender Pay Gap At 5 April 2017   5.04%    Median Gender Pay Gap At 5 April 2017   -5.65%    UK’s National Gender Pay Gap Source Office of National Statistics 2016   18.1%     The mean figure is the difference in the average hourly rate of pay between all men and women in the company.  This is different from ‘Equal Pay’ which is the difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs.    The median figure is when all the hourly rates of pay are put in order from the lowest to the highest number and the middle number in the row is called the median.    Our 2017 pay gap is 5.04%, which is substantially lower than the UK’s pay gap of 18.1%.    The mean gender pay gap figure is influenced by the fact that the majority of staff are male.  As at 5 April 2017 there were 260 men and 25 women, total staff of 285.   The negative median gender pay gap figure of -5.65% shows that women’s hourly rate at the mid point is higher than men.    Bonus difference between men and women:          Mean  82.4%    Median  33.3%     This data is based on 49 males and 2 females.
