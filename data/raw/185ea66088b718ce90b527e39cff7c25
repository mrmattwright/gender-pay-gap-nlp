REACH GROUP GENDER PAY GAP REPORT - 2017

This year, for the first time UK companies, with over 250 staff, have to report on 
their gender pay gap.

We believe that…. nothing is beyond our

We have a diverse, transparent and inclusive culture and our ambition is to 
provide men and woman with equal opportunities to succeed.

The gender pay gap measures the difference between the average earnings of 
all male and female employees, irrespective of their role or seniority. This is 
different to equal pay, which is about ensuring everyone is paid the same for 
carrying out work of equal value. 

This is an incredibly important step forward because if companies are transparent 
about pay, and identify the root causes of any pay gap, they can find the solutions 
they need to build businesses that reflect society.

And that’s exactly the approach we are taking for all Reach Group Companies, we 
don’t want to promote one group of people over another we want to ensure that 
everyone regardless of their race, background, ethnicity or gender has an equal 
opportunity to succeed.

At Reach we want to be the best, we want the best people regardless of their 
characteristics and the Gender pay gap analysis is another valuable tool in 
helping to identify opportunities that ensure we have a fair and diverse talent 
pool.

The Reach organisation exists to empower the individual

Findings

The Gaps in both pay and bonus are driven by the under-representation of woman in the IT 
area of our business. Technical roles generally attract higher pay and therefore bonus which is 
generally a % of salary. This Reach anomaly is supported by the fact that in 2016 less than 
16% of IT Graduates were female. The bonus gap is further perpetuated by a group of 
employees who fulfil roles that do not include a bonus payment, if they were excluded from 
the calculation the Gender statistics for bonus payment would be 86% for Men and 89% for 
Women, again significantly ahead of similar sized companies who are at 46.5% and 45.1% 
respectively.

To address this gap in the IT area of the business the company will evoke;

Gender balanced shortlists –This means we have an equal share of men and 
women on our shortlists for interview 

Continued flexible working solutions for women transitioning back to 
work – these include job shares, part time working, career breaks and are not 
restricted to the IT area

Celebrate our role models –Internally we will celebrate our female role 
models, provide stronger management support to enable our women to succeed

In addition, the group of Employees who do not currently attract a bonus as part of their 

role will be invited to participate in a new bonus scheme

As nothing is beyond our reach we are confident that we can improve our 
gender pay gap statistics in the year ahead and support the publication of 
data to drive accountability and fairness within the workplace.
