Gender pay 
gap report

H+S Aviation Limited strives to be an equal opportunities employer. 
As a result, we welcome and embrace the opportunity to report on 
our gender pay gap. 

At 12.5%, our mean pay gap is relatively low 
for what is widely considered to be a male 
dominated industry. However, in line with our 
mission to be an employer of choice, we are 
committed to reducing this gap further.

We are confident that men and women are paid 
equally for doing equivalent work across our 
business therefore we are focused on ensuring 
that more women are recruited and supported to 
progress into senior roles.

We will review our progress annually and expect 
to see the pay gap reduce year on year. However, 
as we are a low staff turnover environment, and 
because there are wider societal issues to be 
addressed regarding gender stereotypes about 
roles in engineering, a gender pay balance,  
whilst a priority, will only be achieved over the 
medium to long term.

Pay and bonus gap

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN
Based on a snapshot of our hourly rates of pay across the organisation 
at April 2017 and the bonuses paid to men and women in the year up 
to 31 March 2017 the mean and median pay and bonus gap between 
men and women in our business is as follows:

Mean

PROPORTION OF MALES AND FEMALES  
IN EACH PAY QUARTILE
In line with the rest of 
the industry, we are 
a male dominated 
workforce. This applies 
to our most junior roles 
as much as it does to 
our senior roles.

PROPORTION OF MALES AND 
FEMALES RECEIVING A BONUS
All employees are eligible to 
receive a bonus. For the most part, 
the bonus is calculated based on 
company performance; however, 
for management grades, there is 
also an individual performance 
element to the bonus calculation.

2.75%

In this bonus year, 2.75% of our 
female employees received a 
bonus, compared to 9.75% of our 
male employees. So, 7% more of 
our male workforce received a 
bonus than our female workforce. 
However, the median bonuses paid 
to women were higher than those 
paid to men.

Actions we are taking to close the gap

Since we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing 
equivalent work across our business, simply reviewing existing rates of 
pay will not do anything to help to close the gender pay gap. 

We therefore recognise that we need to see more women be recruited, 
and progressing, into senior roles.

To achieve this, we are committed to the following:
1. RECRUITMENT
•   We will target the broadest possible talent pool when 
advertising roles, ensuring that our style of advertising 
appeals to women as well as men.

•   Because we have a low staff turnover, we will focus 
our recruitment activities on graduate trainee roles, 
apprenticeships and internships as a way of introducing 
new talent to the business. We will strive for gender 
balanced short lists in respect of these programmes.

•   Where practicable, we will advertise roles on a flexible 

basis so that working hours are not a barrier for women 
to apply for a position.

2. PROGRESSION
•   We will embrace part-time working where practicable in 

management roles to ensure that working hours are not a barrier 
to career progression for women.

•   We will review our other working practices to identify and remove 

any other potential barriers to career progression for women.

•   We will review our family friendly policies and ensure that they 

provide effective support, genuine flexibility and the opportunity 
for a wholesome work/life balance.

•   We will encourage women in senior roles to act as mentors and 

role models to promote aspiration among women in the business.
