Gender Pay Gap Report

Introduction

At Blue Arrow, we welcome the 
opportunity to share our gender  
pay gap as it will help us have 
more meaningful conversations 
with our people and our 
customers about equality, 
diversity and inclusion. 

We have an overall median 
gender pay gap of 7.74% when 
including all of our permanent and 
temporary workers. Of the people 
included in the calculations, 97% 
are temporary workers whose  
pay is fixed by our customers.  
In the interests of full disclosure, 
we have chosen to also provide 
an analysis of our 639 permanent 
UK employees. 

Among Blue Arrow’s salaried 
employees our median gender 
pay gap is 14.54%, which is 
below the national average 
of 18.8%. Although our pay 
structure equally rewards men 
and women performing the same 

roles, women make up  
the majority of our lower paid 
roles and are under-represented 
in senior management, which 
gives us a gender pay gap.

We are committed to improving 
the gender balance of our senior 
managers, which is key to 
tackling our gender pay gap. 

We are investing in a range of 
initiatives to bring about change 
and this report outlines more 
about what we are undertaking 
as part of a broader focus 
on creating a more inclusive 
workplace, where all of our 
people are able to reach their 
full potential and do work which 
gives them fulfilment and a sense 
of purpose.

Blue Arrow Gender Pay Gap ReportUnderstanding  
the gender pay gap 

Gender pay vs equal pay 
A gender pay gap shows the difference in average pay 
across all of the men and women in an organisation, 
industry or country as a whole. It can be driven by the 
differing number of men and women across all roles. 

It is not the same as an equal pay comparison which  
looks at how much men and women are paid for doing  
the same role. 

How we calculated  
our numbers
Under the UK Government’s new Gender Pay Gap 
regulation, companies need to report their gender pay gap 
for all legal entities in Great Britain with more than 250 
employees. We have provided data on all of our permanent 
and temporary employees, as required by the regulation. 

Given we are a staffing business, we have a very high 
number of temporary workers on our payroll at any one 
time. This number fluctuates depending on requirements 
from our clients, and typically the rate of pay that our 
temporary workers receive is decided by our clients.  
We have also reported separately on our permanent 
employees only and our temporary employees only.

Pay quartiles explained
A pay quartile is calculated by listing the hourly pay rates  
for everyone in the business then dividing them into four 
equal-sized groups. We then work out the percentage  
of men and women in each group. 

Median and mean  
gaps explained
The figure used most regularly is the median gender  
pay gap. To help bring this to life, imagine all of the  
women at Blue Arrow standing in one line, from lowest  
paid by hour to highest, and all of the men doing the  
same in another line. The median gender pay gap  
is the percentage difference in hourly pay between  
the woman in the middle of the line and the man  
in the middle of the line. Hourly pay includes leave  
and any shift premiums, but not overtime.

Highest paid

The mean gender pay gap is the percentage difference  
in the average pay of men and women. This is calculated  
by adding up all of the hourly pay rates for all of the women 
in a business and dividing it by the number of women, then 
doing the same for the men and comparing the difference. 
The mean can be affected by different numbers of men  
and women in different roles. This is why we also report  
the number of men and women in different pay quartiles. 

We also report the median and mean differences in bonus  
pay over a twelve month period, and the percentage of men 
and women who received a bonus. 

A positive percentage shows a gap in favour of men;  
a negative percentage shows a gap in favour of women.

Did you know?

 When including temporary workers, the overall median 
gender pay gap at Blue Arrow is 7.74%. Our pay 
quartiles show how we have more men than women 
across our workforce, because we operate in male 
dominated sectors such as warehousing and distribution. 

 66% of our salaried employees are female, and salaried 
employees tend to have the opportunity to earn a higher 
amount of bonus than temporary staff. For this reason,  
our gender bonus gap is strongly in favour of women 
when including temporary workers, and marginally  
in favour of women among our salaried employees.

 Among our salaried staff, we have a median gender  
pay gap of 14.54%, slightly below the national average 
of 18%. We have a gap because we have more women 
than men in lower paid roles.

Blue Arrow Gender Pay Gap ReportHow we are building  
an inclusive business

At Blue Arrow, we are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse business built on trust, and the following initiatives  
support our goals:

1.  We support a Diversity  

4.  We facilitate conversations 

 

 

 

and Inclusion Network
 As part of the Impellam Group, we participate actively 
in the Diversity and Inclusion network which fosters 
an inclusive and diverse workforce by encouraging 
positive conversations that drive clear action.

2.  We are building a culture  

of Virtuosity
 We continue to invest in our Virtuoso programme  
which recognises that it is our managers who make  
the difference in building trust, relationships and better 
futures for our clients and our people. This focus  
on Virtuosity is central to our strategy and frees  
our managers from conventional thinking so they  
see new possibilities, enabling our people to realise 
their full potential and to thrive.

3.  We address 

unconscious bias 
 All our people take and have access to training via 
our online learning system to help them understand, 
identify and address unconscious bias. We also offer 
this training to our customers as and when appropriate.

 

 

around flexible working
 We are an inclusive business, and we encourage 
flexibility, including part-time work and home working. 
We hold conversations with managers through Open 
Blend, our coaching and development platform,  
which enables us to explore whether personal 
ambitions are being met, as well as business 
objectives. By addressing the whole person, we will 
create a more engaged, productive workforce that 
allows our people to be their authentic selves at work.

5.  We recruit and reward  

people equally
 We currently have a number of initiatives in place which 
ensure equal opportunities and recognition, irrespective 
of gender. These include, but are not limited to: 
ensuring our employees have holistic access to career 
progression paths and succession planning models 
based on skill, competencies and experience; having 
clear and consistent salary banding structures; giving 
employees ongoing training including professional 
development programmes and management 
qualifications, open to all employees; and creating  
a structured, two-tier interview process to ensure  
all hires are not influenced by unconscious biases.
