OUR UK BUSINESS  VF operates two distinct legal entities in the United Kingdom, each with over 250 employees.  The detail in this report covers the gender pay data for both entities; VF Northern Europe Ltd. which is responsible for our UK Wholesale Business, as well as for providing centralized services to the Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) region, and VF Northern Europe Services Ltd. which is responsible for our UK Retail Stores operation.   Our UK Gender pay report  Our UK Gender Pay Report is based on information as of the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.  We have used the ACAS and GEO Guidance on Gender Pay Reporting to calculate the data we are required to report on for each separate entity.  The mean and median gender pay gap is calculated based on the hourly rate of the payments received in the month of April, excluding overtime. The bonus gap considers pay received in the 12 months leading up to the snapshot date.  The mean result is the average hourly rate of all male employees versus the average hourly rate of all female employees.  The median result is the middle value of pay for men versus the middle value of pay for women.  A positive figure would show where women received lower rates than men and a negative figure would show where women received higher rates than men.  As of the snapshot date, VF employed 1488 people in the United Kingdom.  The employee gender breakdown by business is as follows:   Overall, VF had slightly more female employees in the UK than it did male employees.  The required reporting by legal entity is contained in the following pages.  VF NORTHERN EUROPE LTD.  VF Northern Europe Ltd. is the legal entity that operates our direct wholesale business in the UK, as well as provides centralized services across EMEA in Customer Service and Credit. It also provides HR and Finance services to both our legal entities in the UK.  MANDATORY REPORTING       Gender Pay Gap Results    Proportion of Employees Paid a Bonus      Proportion of Employees in Each Pay Band Quartile   COMMENTARY  Gender Pay Gap  We saw a mean gender pay gap of 21.6% that was slightly higher than the UK average (National UK average was 17.4% as per the 2017 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, Office for National Statistics).  The result was impacted by two key factors:   Our legacy businesses have fewer women than men in our more senior roles, particularly the technical functions of IT & Finance, and in the higher paying direct sales groups.  The recent relocation to the UK of our central Shared Services for Credit and Customer Service, has led to an influx of younger employees, largely female, in lower paying positions.   Bonus Pay Gap  The higher than 50% gender bonus pay gap was primarily driven by position specific eligibility rules for variable pay as well as brand based performance differentiation.   Typically, only our more senior roles and direct sales positions are eligible for variable pay which, as previously mentioned, have more male employees than female.  We saw significant performance based incentive payout differences amongst our individual brands. Many of our brands, which typically have a higher proportion of female employees, underperformed, and thus paid lower bonuses.   Pay Distribution  We aim to pay our employees, regardless of gender, equally for doing equivalent jobs.  The Pay Band Quartile distribution shows more female than male employees in all but the Upper Quartile.  This is not an unexpected result based on the previous commentary regarding the demographic make-up of our legacy businesses.  VF NORTHERN EUROPE SERVICES LTD.  VF Northern Europe Services LTD. is the legal entity that operates our Retail business in the UK. It includes all store employees, plus field management and supporting human resources roles.  MANDATORY REPORTING      Gender Pay Gap Results    Proportion of Employees Paid a Bonus      Proportion of Employees in Each Pay Band Quartile   COMMENTARY  Gender Pay Gap  We saw a very small gender pay gap of about 1% that was significantly lower than the UK average (UK average for Retail Trade was 16.4% as per the 2017 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, Office for National Statistics).  The result is not surprising as jobs in our retail business are very homogeneous, and our aim is to pay people equally for the same job.  Bonus Pay Gap  All retail employees are eligible for a bonus based on the performance of the individual store.  The 20-25% gender bonus pay gap was mostly driven by brand based performance differentiation as well as the gender make-up of our part-time employee population.   We saw significant performance based incentive payout differences amongst our individual brands. Many of our brands, which typically have a higher proportion of female employees, underperformed and thus paid lower bonuses.  We have a slightly higher proportion of women in part-time roles among those that received a bonus payout. When bonuses are paid to part-time employees, they are pro-rated to reflect reduced hours.  This is not recognized in the bonus pay gap calculation.   Pay Distribution  We aim to pay our employees, regardless of gender, equally for doing equivalent jobs.  The relatively small proportional differences seen throughout the Pay Band Quartile distribution results support the success of this effort.  I confirm that the gender pay gap data contained in these reports are accurate and have been prepared in line with the mandatory requirements.
