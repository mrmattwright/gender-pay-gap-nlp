Introduction by Brendan Sarsfield, CEO 
 

Peabody is one of London’s oldest and well-known housing associations. Everything 
we do is driven by our social purpose, and our mission to help people make the most 
of their lives by providing good quality homes, working with communities and 
promoting wellbeing.  

As an organisation that strives to listen to and know our customers, it’s so important 
that we reflect the diversity of the people and communities that we serve. 

At the same time, we care for our people and know that they are our greatest asset.  
That’s why we are committed to engaging, motivating and involving our people at 
every level of the organisation. By investing in and empowering our employees, we 
can help them to develop both professionally and personally, giving them the skills 
and confidence to reach their ambitions.  

We want to be an organisation that people want to work for and are proud to work 
for.  

I’m proud to say that our Gender Pay Gap Report shows that we’re an inclusive and 
diverse employer. Female employees are well represented at the most senior levels 
of our organisation, with almost a 50% split between men and women across our top 
two pay bands.  

While we have great foundations in place, there is more that we can and will do. 
We must not be complacent. Having recently launched our Equality, Diversity and 
Inclusion Strategy, we are well positioned to continue supporting and promoting 
diversity and equality, making sure women are even better represented throughout 
Peabody.  

We welcome the introduction of the Gender Pay Gap Report as an important step 
to tackling inequality in the workplace and I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enhance our reputation as an equal opportunities employer.   

 

  

 

  

 

 

Gender Pay Gap Report 
 

New government legislation requires companies with more than 250 employees to 
release data on their gender pay gap based on data from April 2017.  

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average pay of men and 
women across our business; it’s not a comparison of pay rates between men and 
women doing the same job.  

We are confident that Peabody supports equality through fair pay.

The finer details  
 

Men and women at Peabody 
Across our organisation, women are slightly less well represented than men, making 
up 46% of our workforce. While women are well represented at the higher levels of 
the organisation, our lowest paid band is 74% male.

Mean and median gender pay gap 
The gender pay gap is the difference between the mean or median hourly pay of 
men and women.  The mean pay gap is the difference between the average hourly 
earnings of men and women while the median pay gap is the difference between 
the middle-most salary of men and women, when all salaries are lined up from 
lowest to highest.

The charts above show Peabody’s mean and median gender pay gap in pounds 
and percentages. As you can see, Peabody is unusual in that it has a negative 
gender pay gap (median -7.1%; mean -2.4%), meaning that on average - across our 
organisation – women are paid more than men.  When looking at the mean figure, 
women are paid an average of £1.20 more per hour than men and the median 
shows an average of £0.49 more per hour.  

Percentage of male and female employees in each pay band 
One reason for this is that women are well represented throughout Peabody’s three 
highest pay bands, making up 53% of the workforce at this level. At the same time, 
we also have a high number of lower paid male employees in our estates 
management service, so men make up 74% of our lowest pay band.

Bonus pay gap figures are calculated from data for the full 12 months until April 
2017. As you can see, women were more likely to receive a bonus than men. There 
was a moderate gap in our mean bonus, but no gap in the median figure. Peabody 
has an open, equal and fair bonus policy based on annual performance reviews.  

Our next steps 
 

Peabody is proud to be an inclusive, equal and fair employer with a diverse 
workforce. While our gender pay gap report makes for positive reading, we know 
there is always more that can be done. 

Over the next year, we will continue to integrate our organisation following the 
merger with Family Mosaic, and we will begin reporting as one organisation.  We will 
also be forming a new subsidiary, Peabody South East which we will report on 
separately.  

We will continue to support the development of a strong group of female 
employees who can compete for more senior positions as they become available 
by: 

  Updating our job evaluation scheme and pay structure for the new combined 

organisation. This will provide us with accurate and robust information to 
make sure that job grading and pay structures continue to be fair and 
equitable.  
 

  Sponsoring women to attend seminars and to gain qualifications in 

leadership, as well as relevant technical and professional qualifications. By 
improving skills, building confidence and supporting the professional 
development of our employees, they will be in a better position to compete 
for more senior roles and progress their careers.  
 

  Promote and encourage women to develop networks and train more 

employees to mentor others. By having women that are: well connected at 
every level of our organisation, positive role models for other employees and 
empowered to mentor the next generation, we will foster a culture of 
inclusivity and fairness, while upskilling our workforce.  
 

  Promote our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy, including our Gender 

and Families networks. These networks, along with our strategy, will be an 
important mechanism for encouraging equality, diversity and inclusion 
throughout the organisation, championing various causes and promoting 
events like International Women’s Day.  
 

  Ensuring consistency throughout business areas of our bonus award, including 

a review of the gender balance. This will help us make sure that our new 
bonus system is fair and equal regardless of gender.
