GENDER PAY  
REPORT 2018

We are, in our policy and practice, an 
equal opportunities employer 
and we enjoy, promote and 
value a diverse workforce. 

From April 2018, companies are required to disclose annually a number of specific gender pay and bonus 
comparisons. This report provides our data for 2017.

GENDER PAY & BONUS STATISTICS (2018)
The gender pay gap is the difference in average pay between men and women 
regardless of their role. It is different from equal pay which covers the pay difference 
between men and women who carry out the same job. At Galliford Try, where males 
and females perform the same job, and have the same skills and experience, they are 
paid equally.

As detailed above, average pay and bonuses are 
between 31% and 41% higher for male employees 
than female employees.  

The main reason for this gap is the under-
representation of women in the organisation as 
a whole (25%); and the lack of women in more 
senior roles (9% in the upper quartile). 

In a historically male sector such as construction, 
this is not unusual, although we are committed 
to taking action to improve these statistics (see 
below).

NB: these pay quartiles show the proportion of female and male employees according to four pay bands. The 
bands are defined by ranking all our employees from the highest to the lowest paid, then dividing this into four 
equal parts and showing the percentage of males and females in each of the quartiles.

TAKING ACTION

Galliford Try is committed 
to addressing the under-
representation of women in its 
workforce in those roles which are 
heavily male dominated. 

We have considered what steps 
we can take to attract, retain and 
develop women in our business, 
and to ensure that there is access 
to higher skilled roles which offer 
better remuneration and career 
progression opportunities. 

This is a long-term initiative and 
takes into account the challenges of 
recruiting and retaining female talent 
within our sector. 

We have developed a long-term strategy to increase the 
representation of women in the workforce, particularly 
in more senior positions. This strategy focuses on:

Recruitment
 ■ Promoting careers in construction.
 ■ Targeted recruitment campaigns.
 ■ Shortlisting female candidates for all positions 

wherever possible.

 ■ Women returners’ programme.

Retention
 ■ Establishment of a women’s forum / network.
 ■ Agile working arrangements.
 ■ Career breaks.

Progression
 ■ Monitoring the pipeline of talent.
 ■ Inclusive development programmes.
 ■ Sponsorship / coaching programmes.

We recognise the gender pay gap within our business and industry and are taking action 
to increase both the percentage of females within our organisation and the percentage 
of females in higher paid roles. We also continue to be committed to ensuring that all 
employees continue to be paid equally and fairly for the roles that they are in.
