Supporting Narrative 

Under the law, men  and women  must receive equal pay for: 

the same or broadly similar work; 

 
  work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or  
  work of equal value. 

The Trust is committed to the  principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment  for all employees, 
regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual 
orientation, gender reassignment or disability. It has a  clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or 
equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). As such, it: 

  maintains nationally recognised pay scale for teachers and support staff 
 

evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure. 

The Trust is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men  and women 
differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the  roles in which men 
and women  work within the Trust and the salaries that these roles attract. 

The Trust operates within both the public sector and specifically education, it is common for a high proportion 
of the workforce to be femal e. 

The Trust will monitor this data on an ongoing basis as growth and change within the Trust may alter the data 
by the next reporting date.  It is recognised that under TUPE processes the Trust has no control over  the 
staffing complement where  academies join the Trust. 

This initial report and its data provides a baseline for the Trust to compare to in future years to identify any 
trends and whether  or not the actions identified above are having an impact
