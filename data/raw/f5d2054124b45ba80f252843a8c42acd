Opus Energy has a good record of welcoming and supporting diversity, including gender. Our mean and median gender pay gap is 11.9% and 3.6% respectively – below the national average. We are far from being complacent and recognise we have more to do, with more men than women in senior and higher paying roles.  We know that diverse businesses are more successful, and that it is essential we continue to welcome people from a diverse range of backgrounds to our business. We will continue to work with companies in our sector, local schools and universities and within Opus Energy, to ensure that we are providing the inspiration, encouragement, training and development, and support to attract, engage and progress women and people from diverse backgrounds throughout all levels of our business.
