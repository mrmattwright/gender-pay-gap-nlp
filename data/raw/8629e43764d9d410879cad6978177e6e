Dundee University Students’ Association (DUSA) 
Gender Pay Gap Report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017 

 
 
At DUSA, we are required by law to publish an annual gender pay gap report, due to the fact that the 
combined total of employees and workers,  takes DUSA beyond the reporting threshold of 250 
people.

Key points 
 
The mean gender pay gap of 12.2% results from the nature of our 200+ workers, who are almost 
exclusively students at Dundee University, doing casual work across the organisation.  The gender 
balance of our workers is reflective of the gender balance of students at Dundee University (roughly 
2:1, female:male). 
 
There is no median gender pay gap. 
 
The 4th Quartile, which contains the top 25% of earners in the organisation, shows an even 50% split 
between females and males. 
 
 
 
Although the results of our gender pay gap analysis are positive, we will not become complacent and 
will keep our own performance in this area under ongoing review. 

I confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
