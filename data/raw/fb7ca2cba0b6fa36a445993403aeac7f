We believe they are a useful starting point to address this national issue. We are already actively working towards increasing diversity and representation in our own business and supporting initiatives to reduce gender inequality the wider architectural and construction industry.

M 0 % F % ARB December 2016 Report. Hourly Pay Gap  (April 2017) Our analysis shows that the overall difference between men and women’s hourly pay based on a snapshot on 5th April 2017 is 23.4% (mean) and 28.7% (median). When we compare pay for equal or similar work across our organisation the gap is significantly lower, although factors such as our geographic spread, our broad range of consultancy expertise and relatively small size when compared to other organisations reporting make direct like for like comparison of pay equality within strata of our business difficult. 0 .4 % (mean) 0 .7 % (median) Our aim is to achieve year on year reduction of our gender pay gap. Understanding the Gap Like many companies associated with the construction industry, our average gender pay gap is primarily caused by having fewer women at senior grades in our business. While we are seeing a welcome growth in the number of women joining our practice – and the construction professions as a whole – their progress to senior positions is inevitably a gradual one as their careers develop. We therefore need to make a concerted effort over the long term to create an environment in which everyone has an equal opportunity to progress their careers with us. What we’re doing about it We are therefore identifying ways to minimise some of the obstacles to career progression that will help all our employees to fulfil their potential. These include: Increasing flexibility in working arrangements Encouraging good work life balance Improving return to work programmes after career breaks Actively supporting shared parental leave Review promotion listings to ensure all are considered equally Supporting personal development through bespoke coaching and mentoring programmes Our strategic plan recognises the central role that our culture plays in shaping our business. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace at all levels, but particularly through the composition of our leadership team. This makes for a stronger business and a truly engaged workforce. We support the UK government’s leadership in gender equality, and the requirement for companies to publish their data. We will continue to work to narrow the gender pay gap in the UK.
