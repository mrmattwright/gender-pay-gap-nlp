Bob Donoghue -      “ The staff at The Oaks are absolutely marvellous, they give 100% in everything they do for the residents”   Michael Jerwood - Husband of the resident      “ I’m really enjoying working at Bannatyne Lodge.  The pace is more gentle than working in a hospital, I really enjoy the fact that I can start a treatment plan, follow it through and see the positive outcomes.  It’s lovely to get to know the residents and their families and have meaningful interaction with them.  I think that Bannatyne Lodge is a really good example on how nursing care happens in a care home.  Staff have real dedication to the people they care for and you can see it in how happy residents are.   John Paul Brownless - Nurse at Bannatyne Lodge      “ Just wanted to say a ‘Big Thank You’ to all staff for the care and attention. You all are giving to my mum at this time of her life. I know she is in good hands & saw for myself on my recent trip home. Your level of care & professionalism. It is much appreciated. Regards.   Ian Greener -      “ We would like to thank you very much for looking after Margaret, albeit for just eight nights, in late December 2017. We were so impressed by Simonsfield. The environment is absolutely lovely. The staff without exception were delightful… They were so very kind, approachable and caring. It is exemplary care home. We feel that it is due to your exceptional leadership that Simonsfield is such a special place.  Margaret thought that all the staff, the surroundings and the food was excellent. She had a particular “soft spot” for Sophie, Billy and yourself. We would not hesitate to highly recommend Simonsfield to anyone needing care in an exceptional care home. We are just sad that Margaret could not have enjoyed very much longer with you.
