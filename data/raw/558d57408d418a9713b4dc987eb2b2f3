His knowledge, negotiation skills and approach helped to secure an extra third in settlement of my redundancy package.              Anonymous    I recently found myself in need of employment advice and was very unsure and concerned about my rights and the options available to me. Having contacted a couple of local solicitors, Royds Withy King was the obvious choice due to how easy it was to speak to someone knowledgeable and the re-assurance they gave me on the first call. 
Within three hours of my first phone call, I met Matthew Hendra (solicitor) with whom I instantly built a rapport and made me feel at ease, before laying out all my available options and costs in a very straight forward and simple manner.  Taking the advice provided by Matthew, I was able to confidently face the issue with my employer and agree a satisfactory outcome which I would not of done without the advice provided.
5 star service by everyone at Royds Withy King from their polite receptionists at both their Bath and Swindon offices which I visited, as well as Linda in the employment team and of course Matthew who is one of those rare breed of solicitors - patient, understanding and reassuring.              Mr Julian R    I have always found RWK to be highly responsive, expert and personal in their approach. I have used them for conveyance, Will making, probate and trust work all of which was done very professionally.  I also think they offer great value for money.
