Legacy Leisure is proud to provide services to the community and attracting and retaining a diverse range of employees 
strengthens our ability to deliver our goals. At Legacy Leisure the mean (average) gender pay gap is -18.44% and a median 
(average) gender pay gap is -6.55%. Therefore on the report snapshot date of 5 April 2017, on average, female employees 
were paid more than male employees. 
 
The Gender Pay Gap is different from “equal pay”. Equal pay relates to men and women being paid differently for “like 
work” carrying out the same or comparable jobs. At Legacy Leisure, women and men in like for like roles are remunerated 
equally. 
 
In the 2017 reporting period, Legacy Leisure had an overall gender split of 41% male and 59% female. The majority of our 
management and senior roles were held by women and our part-time roles, including coach and teacher roles, attract a 
higher proportion of women. The workforce profile is a majority of employees working in part time roles, which is consistent 
with the active leisure sector in which we operate. 
 
We aim to make Legacy Leisure a great place for everyone to work, regardless of gender, and to be rewarded fairly. We are 
committed to ensuring we have a diverse, gender balanced workforce where everyone can succeed. 
 
I can confirm that the information and data reported is accurate as at the snapshot date, 5 April 2017.
