Gender Pay Reporting
James Jones & Sons Ltd is a long established family business with a commitment to the care and 
well-being of all its employees across the company, many of whom have been with us for over 40 
years.
Where we are able to, we offer employees flexible working opportunities to suit their personal 
circumstances, and our recruitment policy is merit based with no gender bias.
We know that, traditionally, the timber industry has been a sector that has attracted relatively 
few women and we actively support the efforts of our forestry trade body, Confor, to encourage 
more women, and younger people in general, to enter what is a very dynamic and rewarding 
industry.
