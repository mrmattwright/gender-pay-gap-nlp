Introduction

An inclusive working environment  
is essential for everyone to want to, and be able 
to, give their very best for the organisation.
Diverse and inclusive companies make better decisions, 
enjoy better financial performance, attract the best talent, 
manage risks more effectively and innovate more than 
others. As a Group we aspire to reflect appropriately, 
at all levels, the diverse communities we serve across 
four continents. 

As required by the UK government, we are publishing our 
gender pay gap, which measures the difference between the 
aggregate pay for all men in our organisation and that for all 
women. It does not measure the difference between pay 
for men and women performing the same roles. Where 
men and women perform similar roles, they are paid equally.

Our UK gender pay gap reflects the fact that men and 
women have traditionally held different roles, particularly 
in the financial services sector. It highlights the fact that 
we have more men than women in leadership, investment 
management and senior operational roles, and that we still 
have work to do to achieve our ambition of reflecting the 
communities we serve.

The solution is not to change pay scales but to take steps 
to ensure that we attract talented applicants from all 
backgrounds, create opportunities for all our employees to 
develop and progress, and challenge systems, processes and 
mindsets to ensure that they do not disadvantage women. 
The gender pay gap cannot be removed overnight, but 
we are committed to closing it as quickly as possible. 

I confirm that the information contained in this report 
is accurate.

Gender pay gap reporting
The gender pay gap is a measure  
of the difference between the average 
pay and bonus of men and women 
across an organisation irrespective of 
role and seniority. 

This is different to equal pay, which 
 is the legal requirement to pay the 
same to men and women who are 
doing work of equal value.

Who this data includes

Prudential Services Limited (PSL) is the employing entity for 
the vast majority of Group Head Office (GHO) staff.  It also 
employs the UK-based Group Executive Committee (GEC), 
which comprises the Group Chief Executive and his UK-based 
direct reports, and in addition a few senior employees who 
work in a different business unit.  

The Gender Pay Gap analysis for PSL which has been 
published on the website is based strictly on the rules regarding 
the employing entity, and includes the ‘non-GHO’ staff – 
see table 2.  

The Gender Pay Gap analysis for GHO excludes the GEC and 
the employees who work in a different business unit, and is 
therefore the accurate representation of GHO  - see table 1.

The data presented here is for all 
our 503 employees. The mix of 
men and women in our UK 
workforce is currently:

Women 
46%
Men 
54%

The reasons for the gender pay gap

These pay figures demonstrate the 
demographic challenges facing 
GHO and the financial services 
sector as a whole:
— There are more men than women in leadership and 

senior roles; and 

 — There are more women than men in administrative 

and support roles. 

The gap in bonus pay is higher than the gap in fixed pay 
because:

 — There are more men than women in those roles with 

higher incentive opportunities

 — A greater proportion of their total remuneration is 
variable pay in short-term and long-term incentive 
plans; and

 — We support part time working, so that our employees 
can balance their personal and professional lives. Our 
part-time employees receive bonuses that are adjusted 
to reflect the hours that they work although this is not 
recognised in the calculation of the gender bonus gap.  
Of the 6 per cent of staff who work part-time, 79 per cent 
are women.

Closing the gender pay gap
In order to close the gender pay gap we must achieve 
better representation of women in all roles and at all levels 
of our organisation. This goal is reflected in:

 — GHO participating pro-actively in the Prudential 

Group’s initiatives relating to Diversity and Inclusion 
(D&I). This includes:
 –  Unconscious bias training and ensuring gender 

balance on talent development programmes;

 –  Developing a diverse pipeline through the GHO 

apprentice scheme; and

 –  Creating a well-being programme Pru Thrive with 

inclusion as a key theme.

 — Ensuring gender balanced shortlists for recruitment, 

and developing line manager awareness. This has 
already resulted in a significant improvement in the 
gender balance among new hires.

 — GHO supporting the Prudential Group’s commitment 
to the HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter that 30 
per cent of the Leadership Team (the 100 most pivotal 
roles in the Group) will be female at the end of 2021. 
As at 1 January 2018, excluding secondees to 
other business units, GHO has met this target in 
its most pivotal ‘Leadership Team’ roles. This has 
been achieved through concerted efforts in relation to 
the development, progression and recruitment of 
talented senior females over the last few years; and

 — Putting in place wider strategies to continue to invest 

in developing better gender balance at leadership 
team level, and across functions and levels at GHO.
