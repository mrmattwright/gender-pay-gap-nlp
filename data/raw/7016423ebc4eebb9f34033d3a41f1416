MOVING LONDON FORWARD

INTRODUCTION

Crossrail is Europe’s largest infrastructure project, building a new 
railway for London and the South East. Crossrail Ltd (CRL) is the 
project’s management organisation tasked with the procurement, 
design and delivery of the new railway, through an integrated 
structure with project partners and an extensive supply chain.
Crossrail is an organisation committed to the equality and inclusion 
of its workforce. Operating in the infrastructure sector, combining 
the construction, engineering and rail sectors in a ten-year project 
represented a particular set of challenges regarding gender diversity.
Since gaining Royal Assent to build the new railway in 2008 and 
starting construction in 2009, we have made encouraging progress and 
since 2012-13, women have made up around 35% of the Crossrail Ltd 
workforce.
We have undertaken many initiatives in efforts to increase diverse 
new entrants into the organisation and the industry, to train our 
people and to promote women from Crossrail and our supply chain 
as exceptional role models on the project, for the wider benefit of the 
industry.

Despite these initiatives we are disappointed that the Crossrail Ltd 
gender pay gap is not where we would want it to be. This being the 
case, we see the sharing of our Gender Pay Gap Report as an integral 
part of our learning legacy.
With the project over 90% complete and the planned opening of 
the central section of the railway in December 2018, we place great 
importance on sharing our experiences with other infrastructure 
projects and the wider sector. 
With these learnings and the many areas of good practice we have 
achieved across the programme, our industry can embed and develop 
new ways to support a more gender-balanced workforce, which will 
benefit us all.

THE REGULATIONS

Our Gender Pay Gap Report has been calculated 
using the approach set out in the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 (“the 
Regulations”). 

These Regulations place an obligation on Crossrail 
Ltd, an employer with more than 250 employees, to 
publish information relating to the gender pay gap in 
our organisation.

WHAT IS GENDER PAY GAP REPORTING?
Under the Regulations, the gender pay gap is a 
measure of the difference between men’s and 
women’s average earnings across an organisation. It is 
expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.
The Gender Pay Gap is not the same as Equal Pay. 
Equal Pay is where men and women in the same 
or similar employment, performing equal work, are 
entitled to receive equal pay.

HOW CROSSRAIL LTD  
IS ORGANISED

The Crossrail project is made 
up of many workers employed 
by different employers. At the 
reporting date there were 1,200 
people working as part of the 
management team to deliver the 
project, with an extensive supply 
chain. Of these, 554 were Crossrail 
Ltd employees. 
Crossrail Ltd has taken steps to 
ensure our pay data report does 
not include anyone other than 
those directly employed by CRL. 
The gender pay gap report does 
not include agency or temporary 
workers, those employed by 
Transport for London, the Project 
Delivery Partner, the Programme 
Partner or contractors within our 
supply chain.

OUR COMMITMENT TO 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

During the Crossrail project’s lifecycle, a commitment 
to diversity and inclusion has instigated a wide variety 
of initiatives designed to increase the representation of 
women in the workplace:

• 

• 

• 

 Comprehensive equality and diversity training 
was undertaken for all Crossrail employees – 
including unconscious bias training

 The Crossrail graduate programme was 
introduced in 2013, which focused on engineering 
graduates. 15% of graduates commencing the 
programme were women.

 Over 1,000 apprentices were given opportunities 
on the Crossrail project, of which around 13% 
were women, higher than the average of 6.9% in 
engineering and 1.9% in construction*.

• 

• 

• 

*FE Data Library, Updated Dec 2016

 A Respect conference was held where people 
from across the project joined together to 
promote diversity, share ideas and get involved.

 The promotion of women working on Crossrail 
was utilised on Crossrail’s website, careers 
website and through media opportunities to 
encourage women considering the organisation 
and the industry, for the next step in their 
careers.

 A strategic partnership was developed 
with Women into Construction, a specialist 
community interest company devoted to working 
with employers to increase gender representation 
within the construction sector. This resulted in 
over 45 women placed into employment, within 
our supply chain.

• 

• 

 The Young Crossrail programme engaged with 
over 44,000 parents, teachers and young people; 
43% of students completing the Young Crossrail 
Work Experience Programme were girls. 

 An annual Respect Week was held to raise the 
profile of diversity and inclusion and celebrate  
our workforce with over 250 activities across 
Crossrail sites.

HOW HAVE WE CALCULATED 
OUR GENDER PAY GAP?

WHAT IS INCLUDED IN OUR 
CALCULATIONS?

Using the criteria set out in the regulations, Crossrail 
Ltd has determined the number of employees on our 
payroll as at March 2017 (the reporting date), which 
was 554 and has applied the following calculations 
to this data:
• 

 Difference between the mean and median hourly 
rate of pay of male and female employees
 Difference between the mean and median bonus 
paid to male and female employees
 Proportion of male and female employees who 
were paid bonus pay
 Proportion of male and female employees 
arranged in four equally sized quartile bands

• 

• 

• 

To calculate the mean, we added together the total 
value of hourly pay as at 31 March 2017 and then 
divide the sum by the total number of employees. 
We calculated the mean average for both men’s 
and women’s hourly pay and report the percentage 
difference.
To calculate the median we listed the values of 
each hourly rate in numerical order and identified 
the value appears in the middle. We calculated the 
median for both men’s and women’s hourly pay and 
report the percentage difference.
Quartiles are calculated by listing from lowest to 
highest the hourly rates of pay for each male and 
female employee. This list is then divided into four 
equal parts

The calculations are based on payroll data as at  
31 March 2017 only. The data includes ordinary pay 
and bonus data.
Calculation of mean and median bonus pay is based 
on bonuses paid during the twelve months prior to  
31 March 2017.
• 

 Ordinary pay includes basic pay, allowances and 
pay for leave. It only includes money payments, 
so anything that is not money (such as benefits 
in kind) is excluded. 
 Bonuses include anything that relates to pay for 
productivity, performance, and incentives. Bonus 
pay is received in the form of cash.

OUR RESULTS
2017

Crossrail Ltd employed 554 relevant employees who 
are within the scope of the gender pay report during 
the year ending 31 March 2017. Of the relevant 
employees, 65.3% were male and 34.7% female.
Men are disproportionately represented at more senior 
levels of the Crossrail Ltd workforce, reflecting the 
historical base of the construction, engineering and 
rail sectors from which most of our employees are 
recruited.
Crossrail Ltd has proportionally fewer women in higher 
paid roles (the upper and upper middle quartiles) than 
lower paid roles (lower and middle quartiles).
Predominantly, those employed in the three lower 
quartiles receive the majority of their remuneration 
as ‘ordinary pay’. This means that their income is 
guaranteed and not dependent on factors that are 
variable.
The upper quartile is predominantly male. This 
quartile is remunerated with between 10 and 60% of 
remuneration as a variable bonus payment. Bonuses 
are awarded subject to performance and productivity. 
These factors give rise to the high bonus pay disparity.
The difference on employees receiving a bonus is 
1.5% and reflects the fact that there were a higher 
proportion of women than men joining Crossrail Ltd 
part way through the year and therefore not eligible 
for a bonus in that particular year.

CONCLUSION

Crossrail Ltd has a higher proportion of men (65.3%) 
than women (34.7%) employees. This is broadly 
in line with the construction, engineering and rail 
sectors. 
However, we have not met our ambition to see men 
and women more equally represented at all levels 
within our organisation.
A key part of reducing the gender pay gap in the 
sector is encouraging more women to consider 
careers in engineering and construction. Much of the 
talent we needed to attract was from sectors that 
are traditionally male dominated.
Initiatives to inspire the next generation, train our 
people, and develop our employees, were all positive, 
but did not affect the change we would have liked to 
see within the parameters of the project’s lifecycle.
As a country, we simply must encourage more 
women into construction, engineering and related 
industries and support them through their careers 
into senior roles.
