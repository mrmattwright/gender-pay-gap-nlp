The purpose
of this report

 

 

 

Under new laws, welcomed by Genting, all employers in the UK with 250 or more
employees must now report statutory calculations showing the size of their gender
pay gap. This report sets out our results in the year to April 2017 together with
contextual information and the initiatives we have underway to close our gender pay
gap.
 
The gender pay gap gives a snapshot of the gender balance within an organisation. It
measures the difference between the average earnings of all male and female
employees, irrespective of their role or seniority. It is distinct from equal pay, which
is about ensuring that men and women are paid the same for carrying out work of
equal value. We are confident, as a result of our reward policies and regular analysis
and monitoring, that we meet our equal pay obligations across our 4500 employees.
 
Gender pay gap reporting is a critical step in our plans to attract, retain 
and develop a diverse talent population. While our gender pay gap is significantly
better than the current UK average we are committed to improving the position.

We  understand  what’s  driving  our  pay  gap  and  what  we
can do to improve it.  
 
 
We  have  conducted  analysis  and  believe  that  the  gap  is
largely  a  function  of  a  lower  representation  of  women
at  our  most  senior  levels.  We  recognise  this  and  are
proactively  working  to  address  this  via  our  recruitment,
retention,

Bonus
payments

 

 

All  employees  are  generally  eligible  to  receive  a  bonus  or  incentive.  This  is  made  up
of  a  variety  of  rewards  and  some  may  receive  incentives  based  on  team  or  individual
performance or as part of our recognition schemes. Some employees participate 
in an annual bonus plan with the pay-out based on grade, rather than role.

The  median  bonus  pay  difference  of  33%
and  mean  bonus  pay  difference  of  41%  is
largely  a  result  of  a  greater  proportion  of

in  Genting.  However, 
is  a
critical  issue,  and  not  one  to  be  shied

highly  paid  areas,  is  the  main  factor
causing  our  gender  pay  gap.
