Our aim is to ensure that when you come to live in one of our homes you continue to enjoy a good quality of life within a safe and relaxed environment.  All our care homes are located in Scotland and offer care tailored to the needs of the individual. Each home is different, most offer nursing care including specialist units for dementia care though some only offer residential care (please check your preferred home’s individual page for details of the services offered there).  Our business is a people business with care delivered by people to people. While the quality of our homes’ environments is important, more important, in our view, is the quality of staff we employ – they are our key resource. We recruit locally and look to train, support and develop all staff in order that they can deliver our vision of what good care should be.
