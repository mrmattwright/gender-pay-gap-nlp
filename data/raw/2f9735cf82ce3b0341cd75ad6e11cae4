What is Gender Pay and 
How is it Calculated?

Alfred H Knight International (AHKI) pays colleagues the 
same pay for the same job.

AHKI’s gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the salaries and gender 
make-up of the professional, scientific and technical field it operates in. 

In 2017, the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) campaign 
reported that women in the STEM (Science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics) occupations was 23%. 

Within the science and engineering profession, women made up 27% 
of the national workforce. The proportion of women within AHKI in 
2017 was 35%, which is well above the national average. 

• 
 
 
 
 

If all company employees were lined up in a female line  
and a male line, in order of pay from highest to lowest,  
the median gender pay gap compares the pay of the  
female in the middle of their line and the pay of the of  
the man in the middle of their line.

•  The mean gender pay gap shows the difference in 
the hourly rate of pay between men and women in 
 
 
a company.

•  This is different from equal pay. AHKI pays staff 
 

the same pay for the same job.
