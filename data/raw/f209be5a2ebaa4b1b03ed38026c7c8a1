Our role around Human Rights  The Human Rights Act 1998 provides service users with a vehicle through which they can ensure that their human rights are fully taken into account when decisions regarding access to treatment and services are taken. The Act also covers the right to life or quality of life by providing a mechanism for demanding life saving treatment and for non-life saving treatment where denial would have a severe impact upon the quality of that individuals life.  A good way to understand human rights is to see them as a vehicle for making principles such as dignity, equality, respect, fairness and autonomy central to our lived experience as human beings. These core principles are brought to life by a range of different human rights that make them real. The trust and other public bodies are obliged to respect human rights and in the service which we provide to you, can give these principles real meaning.   Principle and corresponding human right    Dignity - Right not to be tortured or treated in an inhuman or degrading way   Equality - Right not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of other human rights   Respect - Right to respect for family and private life   Fairness - Right to a fair trail   Autonomy - Right to respect for private life.
