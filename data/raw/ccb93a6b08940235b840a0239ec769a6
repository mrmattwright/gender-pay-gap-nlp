Because we’re committed to our employees, clients, suppliers, local communities and the environment, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an integral part of our corporate strategy.  Our CSR policy guides our approach to everything from reducing our environmental impact and working with suppliers to ensuring worker welfare within our supply chain, to creating a fair employment environment and continually improving our quality and Health and Safety standards.  Here are just some of the things we do to support our CSR aims:                              Environment     Look closely at the environmental performance of all our suppliers and contractors, and monitor their performance against our own ISO 14001 policies and procedures  Look for innovations that can help our clients improve their environmental credentials, like packaging that's easier to recycle  Carefully plan our distribution routes to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicle fleet                                 Ethics     Share information on health and safety, labour standards, business ethics and the environment with other members of Sedex, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange, to help manage and improve ethical standards within our supply chain  Prolog Gender Pay Gap Report 2017                                Wildlife     Support local wildlife protection schemes by releasing birds back into the habitats that surround our sites, and by maintaining flourishing wildflower populations in our grounds  Encourage our staff to volunteer for local causes such as bird and animal rescue centres                                 Charity     Support our staff to hold charity events such as dress down days, bake sales and Christmas jumper days, and to take part in Race for Life and Shine Night Walk events  Offer unwanted client stock to local charities for them to sell off or use as raffle prizes for their fundraising efforts                            Fulfilment             Returns             Contact Centre             Distribution                    Home / About / Corporate social responsibility /         Get in touch  Prolog, Sherwood Park, Annesley, Nottinghamshire NG15 0DJ  Phone: 01623 724000  Email: getintouch@prolog.co.uk      Latest tweet                Newsletter signup  Our new quarterly newsletter is coming soon                  Privacy policy  Cookie policy  Accessibility     Copyright ©2016 Promotional Logistics Ltd.
