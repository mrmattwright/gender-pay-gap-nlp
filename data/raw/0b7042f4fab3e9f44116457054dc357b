GENDER  
PAY GAP 

REPORT 2017

FOREWORD

At YNAP, we are proud to be a responsible business that 
acts with integrity and works ethically. Our growth and 
sustainability are dependent on empowering our people 
including the wide range of women who work with us. 

Our people ambition is to be the 
destination employer for the best 
talent, creating an environment and 
culture where employees can achieve 
their potential, feel valued and  
be inspired to deliver career  
defining work. 

We believe in addressing the gender 
pay gap and driving initiatives 
that ensure YNAP is a place 
where everyone is supported and 
encouraged to be their best.
 

Women currently represent two-thirds 
of our workforce and we have gender 
parity on our Executive Committee 
(50% female representation) and 
across our Senior and Middle 
management teams.

This report provides our gender pay 
gap information for the UK, where our 
representation of women is currently 
66%. It also discusses the causes of 
the pay gap and our plans to address 
it and strengthen our position on 
gender pay parity at YNAP.    

MEASURING THE PAY GAP 

How we calculate the mean difference

Under the UK Government’s 
new Gender Pay Gap reporting 
regulations, all employers in the  
UK with 250 or more employees 
must now report their gender pay 
gap by sharing the median and mean 
(average) pay gaps between men and 
women’s hourly pay and bonuses. 
This provides a snapshot of the 
gender balance within a  
given hierarchy. 

This is distinct from Equal Pay, which 
means men and women being paid 

the same for carrying out work of 
equal value. We are pleased to 
report that our analysis shows no 
discrimination against females or 
males at YNAP in this respect,  
and we therefore meet our  
equal pay obligations.

The data in the next section shows 
the median and mean pay gaps 
between men and women’s hourly 
pay and bonuses. We will also share 
the proportion of men and women  
in each pay quartile.

UNDERSTANDING OUR PAY GAP 

Our pay gap explained

The median pay gap for employees across our UK 
business is 16.1% and the mean 17.6%.

At YNAP women represent two-thirds 
of our workforce and half of our 
Executive Committee, Senior and 
Middle management teams. 

Our pay gap is influenced primarily 
by two linked factors: 
 
1  YNAP has a high representation of 
women in the first three quartiles 
(Lower, Lower Middle and Upper 
Middle), characterised by more 
non-tech and entry-level roles. In 
the fourth quartile (Upper) YNAP 
has nearly an equal split between 
men and women. 
 
 
 
 

2  YNAP is a technology-focused 

company - while the ratio of 
women employed in tech at YNAP 
compares favourably with the wider 
technology industry, this remains a 
sector where men tend to account 
for a higher proportion of the total. 
 
Due to the greater representation 
of men, in addition to tech roles 
typically commanding a higher  
pay premium, this causes a gender 
pay gap within the business. 
 
YNAP recognises there is room 
for improvement and is resolutely 
committed to improving the 
representation of women working 
in tech and encouraging school 
children, particularly girls, to 
pursue a career in technology.

ADDRESSING THE PAY GAP 

Overall, these figures provide a baseline for us to build upon, 
as we continue to drive initiatives that support our ambitions 
of achieving gender parity in areas where we are under-
represented by women such as in tech. Furthermore, we are 
committed to protecting equality in pay and establishing a 
broader diversity and inclusion agenda.

The results of the Gender Pay 
reporting highlight an opportunity 
to enhance our approach to talent 
attraction, development and career 
progression. We are committed to 
taking action in order to increase the 
representation of women and other 
under-represented groups at YNAP.

We recognise the importance of 
having clear structures and policies  
in place to guide pay decisions  
across the organisation. 

In addition, we understand the 
importance of being a meritocracy, 
which encourages continuous 
feedback and helps coach our  
future female leaders. 
 
We have already been involved in 
delivering a number of key projects 
and are proud of our efforts  
and accomplishments to date.

We’re committed to making further 
improvements by: 
•  Continuing to develop the initiatives 

driven by our Women in Tech community 
therefore attracting and inspiring our next 
generation of female tech talent through 
diversity of thought and investment in  
tech education. 

•  Boosting digital skills for our future 

talent pipeline by continuing and further 
enhancing our ‘Code Lab’ sessions with 
Imperial College.

•  Developing our family friendly and flexible 

working policies and practices to help 
women in the business thrive. 

•  Developing a talent academy to enhance 

our training and coaching opportunities for 
women at all stages of their career.

•  Continuing to review and monitor our pay 

and reward practices.
