Tackling our gender pay gap

We are proud that our senior leadership 
board in London encompasses an almost 
equal percentage of men and women. 
In simple terms, the gender pay gap at  
H+K can be attributed to our current 
organisational structure; however, our 
review into gender pay analysis for this 
report has helped us to focus on why  
there is still a mean imbalance and what  
we now need to do to address this.

How are we working towards equality?
We are working to improve our gender pay gap and the gender 
balance of our most senior executives. We have a wide range  
of initiatives to help people develop, these include: 
Regular salary audits and bench-marking and we have started  
to work this analysis into our pay review process. 
We currently offer a mentoring programme, individual coaching for 
maternity returners and female leaders and compulsory leadership 
inclusion and unconscious bias training for our leadership board. 
This year we will also be launching EQUALL, a new gender equality 
programme, as well as improved flexible working policies.
We are 100% committed to gender equality but do recognise  
that women are under represented at the most senior level in our 
organisation and appreciate we need to address this.  

H+K London is the legal entity holding the employment contracts of H+K London, H+K Global staff 
based in London and SJR and this report for the snapshot date of 5th April 2017 includes all such staff.
We confirm that the information in this report is accurate and prepared in accordance with the  
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
