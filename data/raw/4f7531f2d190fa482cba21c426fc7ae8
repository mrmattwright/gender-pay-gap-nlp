This report focuses on gender pay within 
Channel 4. It sets out the difference in average 
hourly pay between men and women across 
the organisation, as well as other required 
data. As required by the Equality Act 2010 
(Specific Duties and Public Authorities) 
Regulations 2017, we will publish this data on 
an annual basis. This will allow us to track our 
progress and help set the actions that we will 
take to reduce the gender pay gap in  
our organisation.

FOREWORD

Channel 4's gender pay gap 
(mean)

28.6%
47.6%

Channel 4's bonus gap (mean)

We fundamentally believe in and support 
the clear moral, social and economic cases 
for equality and diversity. Channel 4 has 
advocated diversity and inclusion, including 
gender equality, since our creation in 1982. 
The fact that many organisations across the UK 
look to us for our pioneering diversity work on 
screen, off screen and in our own organisation 
spurs us on to do even more to champion 
diversity.

I’m proud to be Channel 4’s first female Chief 
Executive and to lead an organisation that 
employs more women than men and a greater 
proportion of women than other public service 
broadcasters. 

This report focuses on our gender pay gap, 
setting out the difference in average hourly 
pay between men and women across the 
organisation, as at the public authority 
snapshot date of 31 March 2017.  

It shows that Channel 4 has a mean gender 
pay gap of 28.6%. This number obviously 
makes for uncomfortable reading and I am 
determined to take action to address it. There 
is no quick fix, but identifying the complex and 
multiple reasons behind our gap is the first 
step towards tackling the fundamental issues 
at play.

While we employ significantly more women 
than men there is an imbalance in the ratios 
at the higher and lower-earning parts of the 
business. We have more men in higher-paid 
roles, and more women in lower-paid roles. 

It would be perverse for us to reduce the 
number of women in lower-paid roles and we 
want to continue to be an attractive place for 
women to work.  
 
Instead, we must reduce the gap by focusing 
on increasing the proportion of women in  
higher-paid roles. In this report, we are setting 
out the strategy to achieve that, with a goal of 
a 50:50 gender balance in the top 100 earners 
by 2023. 

We have also looked at the question of  
equal pay – not required as part of this formal 
reporting process, but an area that we felt it 
was important to assess – and commissioned 
external counsel to conduct a review of a 
sample of employees. We are pleased that 
when assessing whether men and women 
are paid equally for equal work, this external 
review found no evidence of a systematic 
equal pay problem. However, that doesn't 
mean we're complacent, and we're planning a 
number of steps to ensure that our approach 
to pay is always as fair and transparent as 
possible.

This process has been valuable in prompting 
Channel 4 and others to take a closer look at 
the important topic of women in leadership. 
We want women and men to be equal in the 
workplace and we aim to be at the vanguard 
of that, living up to our aspiration to be a truly 
inclusive organisation.

EQUAL PAY AT CHANNEL 4

Channel 4 is 
committed to 
providing equal 
pay for like work 
or work of equal 
value1. It is right 
and it is a legal 
requirement.

What is equal pay?
Equal pay is a legal requirement, set out in 
the Equality Act 2010, to ensure that men 
and women performing like work or work of 
equal value are treated the same. It is the law 
and all employers must observe it. 
Equal pay applies not just to salary, but 
to all contractual terms and conditions of 
employment, such as holiday entitlements, 
contractual bonuses, pay and reward 
schemes, pension payments and other 
contractual benefits.
The principle of equal pay has been part of 
UK law for some time. Equal pay law does 
not require that everyone doing the same 
job or an equal value job must earn exactly 
the same. There are a number of legitimate, 
non-discriminatory reasons why individuals 
performing the same duties may be paid 
differently – for example, factors such as 
experience, performance and relative 
competency may all be relevant.

1 Channel 4 is committed to providing equal pay for like 
work or work of equal value unless non-discriminatory 
material factors justify differences.
2 Based on a sample of 30 job titles with more than five 
incumbents, representing circa 300 employees in total.

E Q U A L   P A Y   F O R   E Q U A L   W O R K

We are confident that Channel 4 is 
compliant with equal pay law2.

In order to verify this, we 
commissioned a review earlier this 
year, led by external counsel Lewis 
Silkin LLP, which looked at samples 
of broadly comparable groups of 
employees. Based on the samples 
analysed, the review found that 
there was no evidence of a systemic 
equal pay issue at Channel 4. 
Employees were either being paid 
the same for equal work, or there 
were legitimate non-discriminatory 
reasons for pay differences.

We are not complacent, however, so 
to demonstrate our commitment, 
we have also set up a separate 
internal process for employees with 
any concerns about equal pay to 
raise them. We will review these 
promptly and thoroughly with the 
assistance of external counsel. We 
also propose to undertake a wider 
review of our pay practices, and look 
at the introduction of job levels with 
more clearly defined benchmark pay 
ranges across the organisation within 
the coming months.

GENDER PAY AT CHANNEL 4

What is the  
gender pay gap?
The “gender pay gap” is a metric 
that measures the difference 
in the average hourly pay of all 
men and all women across an 
organisation, by reference to both 
mean and median figures. The 
pay taken into account includes 
basic pay, allowances and bonuses 
paid in March 2017 to Channel 
4 employees as at the public 
authority snapshot date of 31 
March 2017.

59% of all of our employees 
are female and we have a low 
employee turnover rate. Yet, 
while confident that we pay our 
employees fairly, we do have 
a gender pay gap and we are 
committed to taking steps to 
address this.

What are quartiles?
Quartiles refer to the division of 
data into four equal-sized groups. 
When calculating gender pay gap 
data, the quartiles are calculated 
by listing all employees' earnings 
in order (from highest to lowest), 
and splitting them into four even 
groups. This then allows you to 
calculate the proportion of men 
and women in each quartile.

There are almost twice as many 
women as men in the lower  
two quartiles (62% and 68%).

Channel 4's gender pay gap 
(mean)

Based on mean average, 
Channel 4 has a gender pay 
gap of 28.6%. This is created 
by two key factors: 
 
•  there is a large number  
of women in the lower two 
quartiles of the organisation
•  the majority of employees  
in the highest-paid quartile 
are men.

GENDER PAY AT CHANNEL 4

Why is this?
The higher proportion of 
men among our top-earning 
employees, coupled with the 
significant majority of women in 
the lower quartiles, effectively 
creates the difference in average 
pay by gender.

There are two key factors that  
have created our gender pay gap:
A   Our gap is skewed by a higher proportion 

of men in senior positions, including in 
departments that attract higher average 
salaries overall, due to external market 
forces and the need to compete for talent. 
This factor accounts for close to half of our 
gender pay gap.

B   We have nearly twice as many women as 

men in the two lower-earning quartiles. 
The high number of women in these lower 
quartiles pulls down the average female 
earnings overall and therefore increases  
our gender pay gap. 

We have taken steps to increase the 
proportion of women in senior roles –  
for example, growing the proportion of  
female Heads of Department by +11% 
between March  2016 and March 2017 to  
reach 41% of total Heads, but there is still 
further progress needed, most notably at  
the highest-paying levels. 

There are nearly twice as 
many women as men in the 
lower two quartiles:

Channel 4 employs a greater proportion of women  
than the other UK public-service broadcasters

GENDER PAY AT CHANNEL 4

Bonus gap 
Based on the average annual gross bonus 
paid, the bonus gap is 47.6% (mean) and 
28.7% (median). 
While men and women are offered the 
same opportunities to receive bonuses, 
there are more men in senior positions 
with higher bonus rates: bonuses can  
be up to 10% of total gross salary for 
staff, 20% for Heads of Department  
and between 30% and 50% for the 
Executive team. Our Advertising Sales 
department operates on a separate 
scheme, linked to advertising revenue.
In addition, because bonus rates are a 
percentage of salary, our bonus gap is 
further increased by the presence of more 
men in the higher-paying upper quartiles.
This is further exacerbated by 22.7% 
of our female employees working on a 
part-time basis, as the gender pay gap 
reporting legislation requires that bonus 
gaps be calculated on actual bonus 
paid, rather than on a full-time pro-rata 
equivalent amount – i.e. it does not take 
into account part-time working.

ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING

Diversity at  
Channel 4 
We have always stood up for 
diversity – it is at the centre of 
our purpose and a key part of 
what we exist to do. 

This data gives us a solid 
baseline and enables us to be 
targeted in where we focus our 
efforts to make the biggest 
impact on narrowing our 
gender pay gap. 

We are fully 
committed to 
increasing the 
representation 
of women in our 
upper quartiles 
through targeted 
actions. This will 
help to reduce our 
gender pay gap 
significantly.

However, we are unlikely to ever  
reduce the gender pay gap to zero. 
This is because to reduce the gender pay gap 
to zero we would need to achieve gender 
parity in our lower two quartiles, which are 
currently predominantly female (65%).
This is not a stated aim as, if it were, it would 
result in actions that would go against the 
spirit of the gender pay gap legislation, which 
was designed to help women achieve greater 
equality of opportunity in the workplace.

Channel 4 is targeting a 
50:50 gender balance in the  
top 100 earners by 2023. 
Currently men make up 66% 
of this group.

Our aim is to boost the 
progression of women at  
senior levels
We believe it is an appropriate target to aim for a 
50:50 gender balance among the top 100 earners 
within Channel 4. Improving the gender balance in 
the highest-paid roles will have a substantial 
impact on reducing our gap. 

We will achieve this by: 
1   Focusing on career progression for women 

across the wider organisation, to help 
create a more equal distribution of gender 
across all levels. This includes our Women's 
Development Programme, which will 
support more than 200 women from across 
Channel 4 over the next few years.

2   Reviewing whether the factors that make 
Channel 4 an attractive place to work are 
sufficiently applied at all levels within the 
organisation, including in senior roles.  
This will be a core project of our new 
Diversity and Inclusion strategy.

3   Undertaking independent qualitative 
research among female staff and our 
4Women network to assess and better 
understand their views about working at 
Channel 4, their professional development 
and career progression opportunities.

4   Reviewing our pay practices, harmonising 
job titles and introducing levels across the 
organisation. We have updated and revised 
our Pay Principles, which articulate our 
approach to remuneration and help our 
employees better understand progression 
and promotion routes.

5   Undertaking a comprehensive review  

of our recruitment and selection practices 
to ensure we attract a broad range of 
applicants and provide a level playing 
field for applicants at all levels. Plus, we 
are currently training all hiring managers 
in inclusive hiring practices, in order to 
minimise the risk of any unconscious bias in 
the selection process.

APPENDIX

The vast majority of people who appear in our programmes are  
not employed by Channel 4 as, unlike most other broadcasters,  
we commission programmes solely from external production 
companies. However, a small number of presenters are Channel 4 
employees and these have been included in our calculations.
Similarly, production staff engaged in making our programmes  
are employed by our suppliers. Their data is therefore not  
included in this report. The calculations do include 22 freelancers  
who satisfied the definition of employee for the purpose of this 
reporting requirement.
Non-Executive Directors are excluded from the calculations as  
they are office-holders, and not employees, of Channel 4.  
They are selected, appointed by and accountable to Ofcom.

How is the gender  
pay gap calculated?

What is the 'mean'?
The mean is the arithmetic  
average of a set of numbers.

The mean gender pay gap is 
calculated by taking all relevant 
"ordinary pay" (as defined in the 
legislation) for women, from the 
highest to the lowest paid, and 
calculating the average hourly rate 
of pay. This is then compared with 
the average hourly rate of pay for 
men, calculated in the same way.

The difference between the two is  
the mean gender pay ‘gap’.

Highest female earners

Highest male earners

Average

Gender pay gap

Lowest female earners

What is the 'median'?
The median is the number in the  
middle of a set of ordered numbers.

The median gender pay gap is 
calculated by taking all of the 
female "ordinary pay" in a sample 
and lining them up by value, then 
selecting the middle ranking. This 
is then compared with the median 
male hourly rate of pay, calculated 
in the same way. 

The difference between the two is 
the median gender pay ‘gap’.

INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT BY DELOITTE LLP TO CHANNEL FOUR TELEVISION 
CORPORATION REGARDING THE GENDER PAY GAP DISCLOSURES FOR 2017

What we looked at: scope of our work
Channel Four Television Corporation (‘Channel 4’) engaged us to 
provide limited assurance over the six mandatory Gender Pay Gap 
(“GPG”) disclosures (“the subject matter”) as required by The Equality 
Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 and The 
Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 
2017 (“the Regulations”) for the reporting period ending 31 March 2017. 
The subject matter addresses the required disclosures for Channel Four 
Television Corporation, which comprise: 
•  Mean gender pay gap (%)
•  Median gender pay gap (%)
•  Mean gender bonus gap (%)
•  Median gender bonus gap (%)
•  Proportion of men and women receiving a bonus payment (%)
•  Proportion of men and women in each quartile pay band (%)

What we found: our assurance opinion 
Based on the scope of our work and the assurance procedures we 
performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the subject matter, as listed above, is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.
What standards we used: basis of our work and level of assurance
We carried out limited assurance on the selected indicators in 
accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
3000 (Revised) (ISAE 3000). To achieve limited assurance ISAE 3000 
requires that we review the processes, systems and competencies used 
to compile the areas on which we provide assurance. This is designed to 
give a similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of interim 
financial information. It does not include detailed testing of source 
data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls. 
This provides less assurance and is substantially less in scope than a 
reasonable assurance  engagement.
The evaluation criteria used for our review were The Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, as described at: http://
www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2017/9780111152010 and The Equality 
Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 as 
described at: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2017/9780111153277. 
What we did: our key assurance procedures
To form our conclusions, we undertook the following procedures:
–  Interviewed management at Channel 4, including those with 

operational responsibility for the assured indicators listed above; 

–  Evaluated the approach for measurement, calculation and reporting 

of each indicator as set out in the reporting criteria at: http://www.
legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2017/9780111152010 and https://www.
legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2017/9780111153277; 

–  Understood, analysed and tested on a sample basis the key 

structures, systems, processes, procedures, and controls relating to 
the aggregation, validation, and reporting of the mandatory GPG 
indicators set out above; and

–  Reviewed the content of the draft disclosure against the findings of our 

work and made recommendations for improvement where necessary.

Limitations
In relation to our work performed on the subject matter, we note that 
our scope of work did not include examinations of the underlying data 
systems, or the accuracy of the underlying data in systems operated by 
Channel 4.

1 The levels of assurance engagement are defined in ISAE 3000 (Revised). A reasonable 
level of assurance is similar to the audit of financial statements; a limited level of 
assurance is similar to the review of a half year financial report.

Responsibilities of Directors and independent assurance provider 
Channel 4’s responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the subject matter and 
statements contained within any voluntary narrative disclosure. They are 
also responsible for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance 
management and internal control systems from which the reported 
information is derived and for calculation of the required indicators. 
Deloitte’s responsibilities, independence and team competencies
Our responsibility is to independently express conclusions on the 
subject matters as defined within the scope of work above to Channel 
4 in accordance with our letter of engagement. Our work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to Channel 4 those matters we 
are required to state to them in this report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than Channel 4 for our work, for this 
report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
The maintenance and integrity of Channel 4’s websites is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by us does not 
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no 
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the reported 
subject matter when presented on Channel 4’s website.
We complied with Deloitte’s independence policies, which address 
and, in certain cases, exceed the requirements of the International 
Federation of Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
in their role as independent auditors, and in particular preclude us 
from taking financial, commercial, governance and ownership positions 
which might affect, or be perceived to affect, our independence and 
impartiality, and from any involvement in the preparation of the subject 
matter. The firm applies the International Standard on Quality Control 
1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control 
including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.
Our team consisted of a combination of Chartered Accountants 
with professional assurance qualifications and professionals with a 
combination of responsible business experience, including many years’ 
experience in providing non-financial assurance.
We have confirmed to Channel 4 that we have maintained our 
independence and objectivity throughout the year and in particular that 
there were no events or prohibited services provided which could impair 
our independence and objectivity.
