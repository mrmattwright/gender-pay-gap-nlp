One way we achieve this is by undertaking audits to monitor our care against standards of best practice.  This enables us to identify areas where our care is very good or excellent which provides reassurance to our patients and the public.  It also highlights areas where practices could be improved. In these circumstances we agree the necessary actions to ensure improvements and monitor progress through further audits.  Outcomes of all clinical audits are monitored internally by our Clinical Governance Group and Board of Trustees and can be accessed externally by the Clinical Commissioning Groups and Care Quality Commission.  Each year an annual audit report is developed outlining all clinical audit activity for the year and identifying the audit programme and a number of key objectives for the following year.
