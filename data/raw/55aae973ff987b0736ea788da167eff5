4In Practice Systems Ltd - Gender Pay Gap InformationNarrative

We are confident that any perceived gap in pay is a product of gender 
mix rather than the result of any pay differential between men and 
women doing the same jobs.

We would highlight that the company currently has a higher 
proportion of men at senior positions which explains the higher male 
mean bonus gender pay gap.

The split of staff within the Company reflects the greater number 
of male staff employed within development and IT roles within the 
company, like many businesses. We have 3 times more men than 
women in the business.

However we recognise that this is a separate issue and the Company 
is actively trying to advance, develop and support women into more 
technical roles across the Company.
