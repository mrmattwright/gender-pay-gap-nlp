Information we collect We may collect non-public personal information about you on RFPs, questionnaires, and other forms we receive from you, as well as from personal contacts such as correspondence, e-mail, telephone calls, or meetings. We may also receive information about you from third parties, such as your accountants, lawyers, financial consultants, and/or other service providers.  It also is possible to receive information from web browsers and apps regarding certain of your online activities using cookies, or other common tracking technologies.  Some web browsers and other applications may provide a Do Not Track (DNT) preference setting.  When a user turns on a tracking preference, the browser or application may send a message to web sites requesting that they do or do not track the user.

To facilitate that process, information regarding client accounts is shared broadly between affiliates within the Wellington Management group of companies. For example, an affiliate may share information with other affiliates in order to facilitate portfolio management or provide client liaison services to a particular client. Client information may be used by Wellington Management in order to identify potential client needs for additional investment management services.  Wellington Management generally does not share non-public client information with unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to perform the investment management services it has been hired to provide. For example, Wellington Management may share non-public client information with brokers and custodian banks in order to buy and sell securities and record those purchases and sales accurately. As a general rule, Wellington Management does not engage in joint marketing arrangements with unaffiliated third parties that involve the sharing of non-public information regarding Wellington Management’s clients. Wellington Management does not provide client information to unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes.  Wellington Management does not disclose your information except as required or permitted by law. In the event that Wellington Management is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or bankruptcy, your information may be transferred or sold as part of that transaction.

No such measure is ever 100% effective though, so we do not guarantee that your personal and other information will be secure from theft, loss, or unauthorized access or use, and we make no representation as to the reasonableness, efficacy, or appropriateness of the measures we use to safeguard such information. Users are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting your relationship team member.

Brendan Swords, President and CEO        Diversity education  We provide our employees with learning opportunities to enhance their knowledge about inclusive workplace practices.

These shared values are core to who we are as a firm, and are the basis for our long-standing commitment to being diverse and inclusive.  All employees are responsible for contributing to our diverse and inclusive culture by mitigating bias from investment, talent and business decisions, and demonstrating inclusive behaviours. For example, each day our investment teams meet to discuss a broad range of investment perspectives in our Morning Meetings . We believe this collegial approach drives better solutions for our clients.  Our business networks and diversity working groups are part of this open, collaborative culture. They connect people with different backgrounds and shared interests on initiatives related to employee engagement, recruitment, development, education and community outreach. The networks offer a global, cross-functional perspective that can help us arrive at more informed decisions for our clients, and support our talent, investment and business objectives.
