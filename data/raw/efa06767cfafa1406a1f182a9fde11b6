NEX endeavours to conduct its business in accordance with established best practice in each of the countries in which it operates. The Group aims to be a responsible employer and adopt values and standards designed to help guide our staff in their conduct and business relationships. The Group recognises its responsibility and integrity in meeting best practice benchmarks when interacting with its employees, investors, customers, suppliers, regulators and other stakeholders. NEX expects to deal with these stakeholders in an open and co-operative way, ensuring full, transparent, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure/public communication to encourage sustained and long-term mutually rewarding relationships. NEX operates a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policy, which is approved by the board and owned by the Group Chief Executive Officer.  Employee involvement and employment practices  The Group is committed to achieving the highest standards in its workplace. The policies and practices in place within the Group to deter acts of harassment and discrimination are regularly monitored. The Group undertakes training and maintains policies designed to prevent sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation against individuals who report problems in the Group’s workplaces.  The Group recognises the value of communication with employees at all levels and incentive schemes and share ownership schemes are run for the benefit of employees. Information on these schemes is set out in note 26 to the financial statements.  Gender pay gap reporting  NEX Services Limited, our UK entity which employs more than 250 employees in the UK, is required to publish annual gender pay gap statistics. The gender pay gap information compares:   the percentage gap between mean and median hourly pay of men and women in the business at a single point in time (currently 5th April 2017);  the percentage gap between mean and median bonus pay of men and women, based on bonuses paid in the 12 months to 5th April 2017;  the percentage of men and women who received a bonus; and  the split of men and women’s pay in each pay quartile, determined by ranking all employees’ hourly pay, from lowest to highest, in four equal quartiles.   It is important to note that gender pay is not the same as equal pay. NEX is committed to promoting equality and inclusion for all our people.  Click here to download our 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report.  Equal opportunity and diversity policy  The Group is committed to employment policies that provide and promote equal employment opportunities for all employees and applicants and to maintaining a workplace that ensures tolerance, respect and dignity for all its employees. No employee, contract or temporary worker or job applicant will be treated less favourably, victimised or harassed on the grounds of their disability, sex, marital or civil partnership status, race, nationality, colour, ethnic or national origins, religious or similar philosophical belief, sexual orientation, age or any other class protected by applicable law.  Health and safety  The Group has a health and safety policy which is approved by the board and owned by the Group Chief Operating Officer. Regional health and safety committees ensure there is an effective structure for delivering compliance with the policy. Under the policy all managers have the responsibility to ensure that a healthy and safe working environment is in place for all employees. As the great majority of the Group’s employees work in office environments, there are no significant areas of risk on which to report.  Environment  The Group’s environment policy is approved by the board and owned by the Group Finance Director. The nature of NEX’s business activities means that the most significant impact on the environment is the emission of greenhouse gases as a result of running the Group’s offices and the associated travel. NEX seeks to reduce emissions by purchasing electricity from renewable sources where possible, minimising the amount of air travel that its employees undertake and recycling much of the Group’s waste. NEX again worked with Carbon Neutral Ltd, an environmental impact consultancy, to estimate the residual emissions of the Group in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents. Worldwide, the Group is estimated to emit the equivalent of approximately 14.5 thousand tonnes* of carbon dioxide or 4.1 tonnes per employee per annum. NEX will monitor its emissions going forward and is working to reduce this footprint. To the extent that NEX cannot eliminate emissions, Certificates of Emission Reduction are purchased under the United Nations’ sponsored Clean Development Mechanism Programme.
