This extends to the longevity of service where retention among male employees is higher than female employees which translate into more senior warehouse employees being male, including those with additional skills such as Forklift Truck licenses and being paid a higher rate than their female counterparts.  This is despite a fair, transparent and inclusive recruitment and development process which does not discriminate on the grounds of gender or any other protected characteristics. And our total employee population reflects the diversity with an almost even split between male and female employees.  However, and to sustain this balance, we are taking the opportunity to enhance our recruitment process, initiatives in consideration including;   Generic CV’s excluding name, gender and date of birth which may lead to subconscious bias  The inclusion of at least one female member of the management team in interview panels  Enhancing our Apprenticeships at all levels to bring new talent into MIQ by working with local education establishments and professional bodies such as BIFA (British International Freight Association)   We operate within a niche, traditionally male-dominated industry where experience is the general route to management positions as opposed to academic qualifications. Equally, it is tougher to break into the freight forwarding industry with experience from other fields due to the nature and complexity of knowledge/expertise required to perform well within our industry. Those in management positions within freight forwarding need to have significant practical experience to enable them to acquire sufficient technical knowledge to perform well at these levels.  However, we are already seeing encouraging signs of a break in tradition with more and more female employees at middle management level with scope to balance the gap in senior management in future years. This is supported by our data on upper middle salary quartile figures.  We are pleased to note that a trend is apparent at the upper middle salary quartile with over 50% being women, an indication that in future years our senior management will be as balanced in relation to gender pay gap.  This is testament to our focus on developing talent regardless of gender. However, we recognise the need to ensure this transfer to senior management and top salary quartile roles.  A further cause for optimism in our dataset is that we have almost an even split between male and female colleagues receiving a bonus. We pay a bonus to the majority of our staff and this is connected to their respective roles.  However, we still see a reflection of the fact that more male colleagues are in senior management then female, which in turn reflects the fact that the value of these bonuses are higher for men compared to women overall.  We are confident however, that given the trend we see in upper middle management where the gender pay gap is balanced towards female employees, that future years will see a continuation of this balanced trend at top salary quartile.  This confidence is backed up by our current and ongoing plans to develop talented employees within the upper middle salary quartile into senior management positions through sponsorship from our VP and Managing Director, Andrew Martin.  Our current Management Development Programme has several female colleagues undertaking academic, as well as internal job-related training, focused on career progression into General Manager/Director level roles in the next 2-5 years.  Coupled with our focus on apprenticeships and formal training for employees in specialist fields such as Finance, HR and IT, we expect our gender pay gap to narrow even further within the next two to three years.
