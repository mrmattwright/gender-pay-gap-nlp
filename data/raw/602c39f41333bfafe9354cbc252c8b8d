At ASSA ABLOY we are committed to providing a 
“
workplace that provides equal opportunities for 
everyone and to ensure that all employees are 
valued. Creating a more diverse workforce at all 
levels in the organisation is a critical part of our 
strategy and essential to our long term success.”
Neil Vann - Market Region Manager

Factors Attributing to our Gender Pay Gap
ASSA ABLOY’s activities cover a wide variety of roles 
including; graded production & engineering roles, 
commercial roles and a professional shared services 
team comprising of finance, purchasing, IT and HR.   
We also have teams of R&D specialists in design, 
mechanical, electrical and software. 

A large proportion of our workers are involved in light 
assembly, many of which are female, contributing 
significantly to our Gender Pay Gap.

It must be made clear that the gender pay gap is not a 
representation of pay equality.  At ASSA ABLOY we pay 
equitably to men and women across our organisation.

What are we doing to improve our gender  
pay gap?

Wendy Weston, HR Director, ASSA ABLOY UK, says:
 One of our strategic objectives is to attract female 
“
applicants into senior and technical roles within 
our business.

We pride ourselves on our continued efforts 
to promote within and we have set targets to 
increase the number of female internal applicants 
for management positions, in addition to achieving 
a more favourable gender balance across all parts 
of the company.

We are also developing initiatives around how we 
influence future talent in schools, colleges and 
universities to encourage a more diverse talent 
pool to enter our industry”

ASSA ABLOY are committed to our goal of achieving 
 
a more diverse workforce and a more equal gender 
representation within our more senior roles.
