Our initiatives for corporate governance, diversity, and remuneration are making steady progress.

DIVERSITY POLICY MANGFOLDIGHEDSPOLITIK   GENDER EMPLOYMENT AND PAY REPORT​ 2017  Remuneration  Remuneration contributes to attracting, retaining and motivating management and employees and ensuring harmony between the interests of colleagues and shareholders. Remuneration of management and staff takes place in relation to performance and results and on competitive conditions in relation to comparable companies.  REMUNERATION POLICY  Internal control  The purpose of DFDS’ internal control and risk management system, as applied in the preparation of accounts, is to efficiently control the risk of significant misinformation. The Board of Directors approves the policies for risk management prepared by the Executive Board, and the Executive Board implements processes to monitor important risks.  GOVERNANCE REPORT  Code of Business Conduct  DFDS has a number of policies that set a framework for how we should behave in a number of areas. However, there will still be issues where laws and policies do not provide sufficient guidance. Here sound judgment should tell us how to act and as a basis for such judgment, we have the DFDS Code of Business Conduct to assist in solving the dilemmas that may arise from time to time.  CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT  Whistleblower system  The DFDS Compliance Line is a website managed by an independent third party, EthicsPoint, with the highest levels of security and confidentiality.
