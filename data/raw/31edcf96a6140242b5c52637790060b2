Gender Pay Gap Report 

2017-2018 

Foreword 

Derbyshire Constabulary is passionate about equality and committed to being as  
representative as possible of the community we serve. 
 
Our gender pay gap data is broadly similar to the national picture in policing, which –  
I believe – tells a story of lots of progress made, but lots of work still to do. 
 
I am confident that we provide equal pay for equal work and determined that the 
force will never become complacent in that regard. That said; we do have a gender 
pay gap. It is caused largely by the over-representation of men in senior positions 
and in periods of longer service. 
 
While we understand there is no quick fix and it takes time to see the results of  
work in this area – we are determined to close the gap. 
 

Derbyshire Constabulary is already hosting a number of initiatives aimed at promoting gender equality.  
The nationally acclaimed ‘Springboard Women’s Development Programme’ is in place, together with a  
gender support network and mentoring initiatives. 
 
Positive action events have taken place to encourage women into specialist posts, and senior  
representatives of the force recently marked International Women’s Day by making the HeForShe pledge. 
The force also employs Job Analysts who monitor recruitment, retention and promotion so any patterns  
of under-representation can be understood and addressed.  
 
We will continue to design fairness into every recruitment and promotion process, both for staff and officer 
positions, as well as ensuring that we are as flexible an employer as possible for the balance of work  
and family life.

What is the Gender Pay Gap?  

Does a Gender Pay Gap mean that 
men and women are paid differently 
for the same work? 

 

No. It is important to understand that that the  
figures contained in this report do not mean that 
men and women are being paid differently for  
equal work. Police officer and police staff pay  
is determined according to their roles, with no  
reference to gender. Female and male officers  
and staff who undertake the same role, have  
the same length of service and work the same  
hours thereby receive the same pay.  
 
Nevertheless, when considering average pay 
across the workforce, differences are apparent. 

The Gender Pay Gap is an equality measure 
that shows the difference in average earnings 
between men and women across the combined 
workforce of police officers and police staff 
whole organisation. It is calculated using two 
methods of “average” pay across quartiles  

 

the mid-point in the range 

the whole range expressed   
as an average and 

 
Mean:   
 
 
 
Median : 
 
The way the gender pay gap is calculated is 
prescribed in the Gender Pay Gap reporting  
Requirements 2017, so all organisations with 
over 250 employees report on data in the same 
way. This enables realistic comparisons across 
sectors and like organisations. 
 
According to the Annual Survey of Hours and 
Earnings 2017 the UK national gender pay  
gap currently stands at 17.4% for mean  
earnings and 18.4% for median earnings.

Understanding Our Data 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 

Male police officers receive the highest average hourly rate of pay and female police staff receive the 
lowest. Because 69.1% of our male employees are police officers, the average male hourly rate of pay  
is increased overall.   
 
Our female workforce is 65.7% police staff which has the effect of decreasing the average hourly rate  
of females overall.

Understanding Our Data

Police Officers: 

When comparing male police  
officers with female police officers 
we compare the same rate of pay  
at each rank which is a like for like 
comparison. Similarly male and  
female police staff pay compared  
at each pay grade have the same 
rate of pay. Again, this is very  
much a like for like comparison. 
 
When police officers and police  
staff are combined we are no  
longer comparing male and  
female employees on the same 
terms and conditions. This  
combined with the gender mix  
of our workforce has the effect  
of distorting our overall pay gap.

Pay Quartiles with Derbyshire Constabulary 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
These quartile graphs show that Quartile 1 is heavily populated by  
women, whilst Quartile 3 and Quartile 4 are more heavily populated  
by men. Quartile 2 is more evenly split. 
 
This means that there are more men than women in senior posts in the  
organisation. 
 
Police officer terms and conditions are set nationally by the Government 
based on recommendations from the independent Police Remuneration  
Review Body (PRRB) and are bound by Police Regulations. Salary  
ranges are determined in accordance with rank and length of service. 
 
Men have traditionally dominated the police officer workforce and this is  
supported by the figures here in Derbyshire which show that 69.3% of  
police officers are male.  
 
Over recent years we have recruited more females into police officer roles 
however men typically have longer service and are therefore paid more  
because of annual pay awards based on time served. 
 
Conversely the police staff workforce is predominantly female who make  
up 65.7% of that group of staff. Salary ranges are determined through an  
industry standard job evaluation scheme which offers a systematic way of 
comparing different jobs in an organisation to establish their relative worth 
and position on pay scales. Due to the nature of most police staff roles,  
they attract a lower rate of pay than police officers.

Developing Our Workforce 

Derbyshire Constabulary has long been committed to stamping out inequality by creating a  
workplace where discriminatory behaviour is unacceptable and acted upon. Our strategic people 
plans contain measures to ensure that we continue to develop the talent of our female workforce 
and there by contribute to closing the gender pay gap through a number of measures including: 
 
  Continued focus on recruiting more female officers will likely reduce the pay gap in future years.  

Recruitment campaigns and awareness days designed to promote equality through engaging with  
partners, the local communities and staff at all levels are in place to achieve this. New ways of joining 
through direct recruitment into leadership roles (Direct entry Inspector) offer new opportunities to  
increase female representation at this level.  

 
  Helping female staff to realise their full potential and progress to high paid roles through promotion.  
A mentoring scheme is in place to encourage relationships where experienced colleague uses their 
greater knowledge and understanding of the work or workplace to support the development of a  
more junior or inexperienced member of staff.   

 
  Representation of women in senior roles needs to improve and this one reason we offer the  

Springboard Women’s Development Programme. Springboard is an award-winning personal and  
professional development programme, designed and developed by women for women. It has been  
created specifically to enable women to achieve their full potential, both at work and in their personal 
lives. It is designed for women from all backgrounds, ages and stages of their lives.   

 
  Our approach to flexible working is being carefully considered to ensure that we  

remain open minded, adaptable and modern in our approach to working time  
and family leave. 

 
  Regular confidence building and personal effectiveness sessions.
