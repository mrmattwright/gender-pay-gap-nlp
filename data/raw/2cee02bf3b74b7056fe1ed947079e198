This requires six calculations to show the difference between the average earnings of men and women employed in our Trust; it does not involve the publication of individual employee data.  The Two Counties Trust is required to publish the results annually on the Trust website and on the government’s Gender Pay Gap reporting service.  The Gender Pay Gap is not the same as Equal Pay.  Equal Pay deals with the pay differences between men and woman who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value and it is unlawful to pay people unequally because of their gender, whilst the Gender Pay Gap shows the difference in the average pay between men and women in the workforce.  Further information on Gender Pay Gap reporting can be found on the ACAS website.  The data for The Two Counties Trust can be found HERE     © 2018 Two Counties Trust.
