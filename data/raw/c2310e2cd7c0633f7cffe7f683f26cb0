We apply a set of standards to our suppliers through our Supplier Code of Conduct. In order to do business with TP ICAP, our suppliers must accept responsibility to be held accountable to our Supplier Code of Conduct. Any new supplier who is being on boarded must attest that they meet those standards. Where suppliers fail to meet our expectations, we work to remediate gaps  We also take our obligations under the Modern Slavery Act (UK) extremely seriously. Any new supplier needs to declare that they strictly adhere to this Act. In 2017 we conducted an initial analysis of our top 30 direct suppliers concluding that they are all located in the US and EMEA and are, on balance, viewed as low risk. Many of our suppliers have comprehensive policies related to modern slavery.  As a first step towards gaining a better understanding of our supply chain, we wrote to our top 30 suppliers, communicating our principles for modern slavery and asking for information about their policies and processes for tackling forced labour and human trafficking.  To raise awareness of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and in our supply chains, we provided specific modern slavery training to all employees who work directly with our suppliers in 2017.
