This involves carrying out calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing personal individual data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. Our data, taken as at 5 th April 2017, & accompanying statement is set out as follows:   John Cook, Director  Chair – Remuneration & Search Committee        Women’s hourly rate is      20.19%    1.09%     LOWER  LOWER    (mean)  (median)          Top quartile  Upper middle quartile  Lower middle quartile  Lower quartile     51.7%    48.3%    35.3%    64.7%    27.8%    72.2%    23.9%    76.1%     MEN  WOMEN  MEN  WOMEN  MEN  WOMEN  MEN  WOMEN           The East of England Co-op employs 4,288 colleagues across a diverse range of businesses primarily in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.  We are a co-op, and run our businesses for the benefit of people and communities, not just for profit.  This means we believe in a fair and ethical approach to pay. We believe men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs within our organisation and that all appointments are based on merit.  Some facts about the East of England Co-op   66% of all colleagues are female  55% of all managers are female This is an increase of 5% from the previous year and is more consistent with the greater number of women we employ. Much of this change has been driven by the appointment of more female Team Managers within our food stores.  50% of our Board of Directors are female  We have a female Joint Chief Executive as part of our collegiate Chief Executive team  50% of all applicants for our Management Advanced Apprenticeship last year were female  We appointed 2 female Apprentice stonemasons last year into what has traditionally been a male dominated working environment   Our approach to pay and benefits   Colleagues under 25 years olds are paid our full adult pay rate rather than using the lower tier permitted under the national living wage  New starters are immediately paid at the full rate for their role, rather than at a a reduced ‘starter rate’  Our highest paid colleague is paid 17 times that of our lowest paid colleague. This is within the maximum ratio of 20 recommended by the Work Foundation  Our Executive pay costs are lower, in real terms, than they were in 2008.  The total increase since then is 0.7%.  We do not operate any bonus or performance related pay schemes, which is why there is no data on potential gender pay bonus gaps  We provide sick, holiday and pension contributions that exceed statutory requirements. We also provide life assurance, colleague discount and an Employee Assistance Programme   Actions  Our current mean pay difference of 20.19% shows that there is an opportunity to do much more. Whilst, we almost have a gender pay parity in our top quartile of pay we still have a gender imbalance in the higher paying roles within this.  Our focus is to achieve parity in all of our higher paying roles.  We want female colleagues to be better represented in the talent pools from which we recruit our future senior managers.  Our plan of action is to:   Put a greater emphasis on flexible working and showcasing successful examples of flexible working across our internal communications.  Create better access to management training opportunities.
