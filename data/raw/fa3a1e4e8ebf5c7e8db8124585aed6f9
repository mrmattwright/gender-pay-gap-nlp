       Skip to content    Ravensbourne                  Equality & Diversity   We recognise that we need such policies within which Ravensbourne’s intention can be clearly stated. The framework is explicit in defining how Ravensbourne intends to implement the policies and emphasises the responsibility of all staff to ensure that both its letter and spirit are integrated into the daily life of Ravensbourne. We look to all staff and students to understand and interpret how these policies affect their own role and how they will contribute to the policies’ success.  Linda Drew Director and Chief Executive   Ravensbourne is committed to the on-going development of a community which continually strives to achieve equality of opportunity, promoting good relations among its staff and students and creating a learning environment within which all members of the community can fully realise their individual potential.  We recognise that our continued success depends upon having a community with a diverse range of skills, backgrounds and experience that spark ideas and encourage innovation and creativity.  Ravensbourne wishes to ensure that all staff and students work in a climate free from unfair treatment, harassment or abusive behaviour. We recognise that discrimination can manifest itself in different ways and that its effect is destructive both to those who experience it and to those who cause it. Therefore, whether you are staff, student, visitor or applying for employment or study, we are committed to challenging and addressing unlawful discrimination or unfair disadvantage.  We have developed our Equal Opportunities pages to support our views and policies on Equality and Diversity. We hope you will find these pages useful and informative, whether you are a student, staff member or visitor. This website is continually developing and we value your opinion.  For more information on Equal Opportunities, please visit Equality Challenge Unit website.
