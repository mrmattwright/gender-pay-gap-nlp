Gender Pay Gap 2017 

Report 2017 

Date of preparation: 15 February 2018 

 

 

Norgine B.V. is a Dutch specialist 
pharmaceutical company employing over 
1,000, people across Europe and Australia, 
and employs around 600 people in the UK. 
 
In the UK, Norgine reports a median gender 
pay gap of 15.53% (below UK average) and 
mean pay gap of 28.26%. Further analysis of 
our gender pay figures highlight that within the 
lower three quartiles there is a negative pay 
gap, indicating that women are paid more than 
men.  
 
As an organisation we are confident that men 
and women are paid equally for doing the 
same job at Norgine.  However, the greater 
proportion of men than women in senior roles 
(quartile 4) creates a gender pay gap. 
 
Norgine is directly addressing this imbalance 
through the introduction of a new recruitment 
process which includes re-training, offering 
flexible working opportunities at all levels 
within the business and continuing to foster  
an inclusive culture. 
 
Norgine’s core value embedded within its pay 
philosophy, is for all employees to receive 
equal pay for equal work. 
 
Norgine is proud to be a responsible business 
that is dedicated to providing inclusive, non-
discriminatory and equitable policies and 
practices.
