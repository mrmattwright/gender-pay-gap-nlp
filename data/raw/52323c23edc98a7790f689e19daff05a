Gender pay gap report 2017

Forest Holidays purpose is to create positive experiences in Britain’s
amazing forests; connecting people, nature and local communities.

What is the gender pay gap? 

We believe that to bring the benefits of the forest
into people’s lives and connect people with nature,
it is important that we are rooted in the local
community.

As a business championing UK tourism, employing
local people who know and love their area is key.
Forest Holidays is proud to employ over 600 local
people in rural areas across the country. Our teams
act as ambassadors for the region and our success
is founded on their enthusiasm and dedication to
providing our guests with an exceptional holiday
experience.

The new gender pay gap regulations,
introduced by the UK government, require
all businesses with 250 or more employees
to report their gender pay gap. 

The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay.
Equal pay requires that women and men doing the
same or similar jobs should be paid the same. 

A gender pay gap may occur even if women and
men are paid the same amount for similar roles, if
the majority of senior positions are occupied
primarily by one gender. 

The gender pay gap is the percentage difference
between average hourly earnings for women and
men, irrespective of their role or experience. This
report shows the mean and median difference, the
bonus pay gap and the proportion of men and
women in each quartile.

We are committed to recruiting from the immediate
area at each of our locations, offering a range of job
opportunities for local people, including full-time
and part-time roles with apprenticeships and career
development opportunities. We believe passionately
that teamwork brings the best results and act as one
team regardless of job role or location. 

At Forest Holidays we care about team well-being,
take a real interest in each other’s professional
development and thrive in creating the best
environment for all.

This is our first gender pay gap report based on the
UK’s new gender pay reporting requirements and we
will continue to share our progress annually.

Our gender pay
gap results 

This report shows the gender pay gap as at
April 2017. The bottom right graph
demonstrates the mean and median pay
difference between women and men within
the business, irrespective of their role or
experience.

The main reason for our mean gender pay gap is
due to 80% of our team members working in
support or non-managerial positions across our nine
locations in the UK. Within that population, 69% are
women. 

The gap also arises due to women holding fewer
senior positions than men. Currently 80% of our
Directors are men, which is reflected in the results,
however we are seeking to address this over the
longer term with over 47% of our other senior
leaders in the business comprising of women. 

The nature of our business means that we employ a
greater number of people at our locations than in
our Support Centre. Employees looking for part-
time hours are often attracted to roles on location
due to the flexible working hours on offer.

Although all of our roles are gender neutral, the
large majority of these roles are held by women and
this also makes up a significant part of our gender
pay gap.  

Our median pay gap, which represents the middle
point of the population is significantly better than
the national average (18.4%) at only 0.64%.

Our gender bonus gap results 

Proportion of employees receiving bonus

The largest proportion of our team members are location based in support or non-
managerial positions. Following feedback, an enhanced rate of pay was introduced
for these employees in April 2016 as an alternative to a discretionary annual bonus
scheme. This guaranteed enhanced rate of pay exceeds the National Living Wage
(NLW) by 3.4%.

Furthermore, we have also extended the NLW to
everyone above the age of 18 years, instead of the
mandatory age of 25 years and above.

of men in this population and also in senior
positions within the business.

Our commitment

Flexible working
We are committed to offering team members the
flexibility to achieve a work-life balance and a
working pattern that fits around their home life. For
many this flexibility is more important than a higher
income. 

Across the business, over two thirds of all
colleagues work part-time (less than 30 hours per
week) of which 75% are women. We have a suite of
flexible working practices for parents returning to
work after maternity, paternity or adoption leave,
including term-time contracts and part-time or
reduced hours.

Career development
We encourage all team members across the
business to progress and achieve their career
aspirations. 

In 2017 our Management Development
Programme, which is designed to help colleagues
progress from junior manager roles to senior
management positions, comprised 50% women.

Our Leadership Development Programme, which
supports the development of team members from
senior leadership positions to Director level,
comprised 42% women.

87% of employees undertaking an apprenticeship
to further develop their skills are women. 

Closing the Gap
Gender balance is really important to us and
although 66% of the 603 employees in our business
are women and the number of women in other
senior leadership roles comprises 47%, we
recognise there is still opportunity to address
imbalances.

As our business and also the number of our
employees grows, we will continue to review our
recruitment and retention practices to ensure that
we continue to strive to be a diverse and inclusive
employer.
