Equality, diversity and inclusion underpins all our work and is at the heart of what we are and what we do. Our commitment is not restricted to the minimum legal requirements of equalities legislation, as we aim to deliver best practice whenever possible.  The University of Portsmouth is a diverse, multicultural and international community, committed to working in an inclusive way, developing a workforce that reflects our student community, the City of Portsmouth and the region’s diversity.  We are determined to identify and remove any potential gender bias and to ensure that we have an inclusive culture that values all staff.  I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate and satisfies the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  Peter Brook Director of Human Resources  Gender pay gap figures  The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean and median) earnings of men and women and is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.  A gender pay gap above zero will show that, on average, men earn more. Complying with statutory calculations, the University has identified its gender pay gap in relation to the:   mean and median difference between hourly rates for males and females  the mean and median difference between bonus pay for males and females  the proportions of male and female employees who were paid bonus pay  the proportions of male and female employees in each pay band quartile.          The mean pay gap  The mean pay gap is the difference between the average hourly rate of pay between males and females. The University’s mean pay gap is 14.7% which is lower than the wider economy (17.4%*) and lower than the HE sector (15.5%*). By the University’s own internal measurements, the mean pay gap has been steadily reducing since 2005.  The median pay gap is the difference between the middle point of average hourly rates (when listed in numerical order) of pay for males compared to the middle point for females. The University’s median pay gap is 23.3% which is higher than the wider economy (18.4%*) and higher than the HE sector (14.3%*). This is largely due to the significantly higher proportion of female staff within support services at the lower grades within the University’s pay structure.  * Source: ONS 2016-17               Gender bonus gap  Bonuses paid within the University consist of Recognition Awards paid to individuals and teams who have excelled in their performance and the allocation of vouchers to staff as a token of thanks for their contribution throughout the year.  The mean bonus gender pay gap shows the difference between the average bonus pay received by male and female staff. The mean bonus gender pay gap for University staff is -0.5%.  The University’s median gender bonus gap is 0%.                Proportion of male and female colleagues receiving a bonus  The proportion of colleagues across the University who received a bonus under the statutory definition was virtually identical.  ‌‌‌‌               Proportion of male and female colleagues in each pay quartile  The University has identified the percentage of female and male colleagues in each of four pay quartiles, by dividing the workforce into four equal parts.  Female colleagues account for 61.3% of the lowest quartile and 65.8% of the lower middle quartile. The upper middle quartile is more balanced with female colleagues making up 53.2% of this population.  In the upper quartile, the split between female and male is 42% female and 58% male.  ‌‌    ‌          Why we have a gender pay gap  A major contributing factor to the University’s gender pay gap is the significantly higher proportion of females in the lower two pay quartiles, undertaking roles such as administration and catering which traditionally have attracted female applicants. These roles have also tended to provide flexibility around part time working which is attractive to those with caring responsibilities.  Another contributing factor to the University’s pay gap is the higher proportion of males in more senior academic roles. This is not only a concern for the University but a wider known issue across the Higher Education sector.  We need to increase the numbers of women in leadership positions across the University, particularly in academic roles, and we also need to ensure that roles at all levels across the University attract a diverse pool of applicants.  The University recognises that many challenges remain and is determined to take action to ensure that our day to day practice reflects the quality of our policy commitments.  How we are addressing the pay gap  Equality and inclusion is integral to the University’s ‘ People Strategy ’ and the University is committed to deliver against its ambitions as outlined in this Strategy.  The University is very proud to have achieved a Bronze Award for the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU) Athena SWAN Charter, in recognition for work undertaken to address gender equality in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) across the Institution. The University is committed to maintain its Bronze Award under the new extended principles which support gender equality across all academic and professional areas and has developed a comprehensive action plan in order to achieve this.  A wide-ranging strategic review of recruitment and selection approaches and methodologies used across the University is planned, to ensure that roles attract a diverse pool of applicants and that salaries on appointment within grade reflect the level of skills and knowledge. A working group looking at how the University can develop its apprenticeship programme is being established, looking at how apprenticeship programmes can be used to support career development for existing and new staff.  The University’s maternity and adoption leave provision is currently being reviewed and enhanced and initiatives to raise staff awareness around flexible working and shared parental leave are also being considered.  We have an ongoing commitment to Aurora and Springboard programmes which support women’s career development and promotion prospects. The Aurora Programme is run by the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education. This programme is run by women for women and draws on successful women from higher education and other sectors as speakers and role models to share their experiences and knowledge about the world of work and career development. The Springboard Programme is a three month personal and work development programme for women, not a management development programme, but designed to complement the Aurora Programme and help prepare women, where appropriate, to apply for future Aurora Programmes.  A University wide Coaching and Mentoring scheme has been introduced, providing a supportive opportunity to aid staff in identifying and achieving career goals, explore ideas and facilitate learning, as well as promoting a culture of equality and diversity.  A revised on-line Performance and Development Review (PDR) scheme, linked to a new Career Development Framework is currently being piloted with the intention of rolling this out across the University in 2018/19. The Career Development Framework underpinning the PDR scheme helps staff to identify and build on strengths, explore opportunities within the University and identify how to access available resources.  In order to monitor the success of these initiatives in reducing the University’s Gender Pay Gap, ongoing reporting and analysis will be undertaken and embedded into the University’s wider workforce reporting.
