 

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
 
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was formed in 1974, serving more than 2.5 million people and 
covering an area of 500 square miles. GMP is split into 10 Districts - Bolton, Bury, City of 
Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan and a number of 
specialist branches. 
 
We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 
(Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017. 
 
This involves carrying out six calculations (shown below) that show the difference between the 
average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it does not involve publishing individual 
employee data: 
 

• 

• 

• 
• 
• 
• 

the difference in the mean (average) hourly rate of pay between male and female full-pay 
relevant employees  
the difference in the median (mid-point) hourly rate of pay between male and female full-
pay relevant employees  
the difference in mean bonus pay between male and female relevant employees  
the difference in median bonus pay between male and female relevant employees  
the proportions of male and female relevant employees who received bonus pay, and  
the proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in each of the four quartile 
pay bands.  

 
This Gender Pay Gap report is based on data as at the 31st March 2017.  At this date GMP paid 
ordinary pay to 6061 Police Officers and 4078 members of Police Staff.  Our Gender Pay Gap 
report is based on the combined number of Police Officers and Police Staff, which totals 10139.

Mean Pay Gap 
 

 

 

We calculated the average standard hourly rate for 
males (M = £17.88) and females (F = £15.76).   
We then used the formula provided (M – F) ÷M x 100 to 
determine our Mean Pay Gap 
The result has shown that males are paid an average 
hourly rate of 11.85% higher than females.

Median Pay Gap 

 
     14.05% 

 

We found the median hourly rate for males (M = £18.36) 
and females (F = £15.78), by placing the standard hourly 
rates of males in ascending order and chose the hourly 
rate which fell in the middle, we then repeated this for 
females. 
We then used the formula provided (M – F) ÷M x 100 to 
determine our Median Pay Gap 
The result is that men have a 14.05% higher median 
hourly pay rate than females. 

GMP’s Gender Bonus Pay Gap 

The Home Office have agreed the provision for Chief Constables to award bonus payments to 
Police Officers of between £50 and £500 for occasional work of outstandingly demanding, 
unpleasant or important nature e.g. hostage negotiation, or fingerprinting and searching badly 
decomposed bodies.  In GMP we have also extended these provisions to Police Staff. 

District Commanders have discretion to authorise bonus payments up to the value of £100, for 
instance for Chief Constables commendations or acts of outstanding bravery.  Nominations for 
payments over £100 are considered by the Human Resources Governance Group and include a full 
rationale.

We calculated the average Bonus Payment for males (M 
= £115.91) and females (F = £184.72).  
We then used the formula provided (M – F) ÷M x 100 to 
determine our Mean Bonus Pay Gap 
The result has shown that females are paid on average 
59.36% higher bonus payments than males.

We found the median bonus payment for males (M = 
£50.00) and females (F = £50.00), by placing the bonus 
payments of males in ascending order and chose the bonus 
payment which fell in the middle, we then repeated this for 
females. 
We then used the formula provided (M – F) ÷M x 100 to 
determine our Median Bonus Pay Gap 
The result, as they are both the same amount, being a 0% 
gap. 

The proportion of male employees who were paid a bonus payment in the 12 month period is 
1.28%. 

The proportion of female employees who were paid a bonus payment in the 12 month period is 
1.09%.

Pay for Police Officers and Police Staff are agreed nationally.  Police Officer salaries are set by 
the Home Office and are based on a rank structure.  All Police Staff roles are taken through 
GMP’s job evaluation scheme; the role is reviewed against a standard set of factors and awarded 
an appropriate score for each factor.  This overall score then determines the grade of the role.  
The evaluation is completed by an independent trained team of evaluators. This ensures 
consistency is applied in determining Police Staff grades and that the correct salary is paid for the 
responsibility undertaken in the role. 
 
We are confident that there are no differences in pay rates for different genders occupying 
equivalent roles, given the national rank structure for Police Officers and Police Staff pay grades 
being set nationally and subject to job evaluation at a local level. This is not, therefore, an equal pay 
issue. 
 
In addition to calculating the gender pay gap for the whole of the organisation we have also 
repeated the six calculations for both Police Officers and Police Staff.

We calculated the average standard hourly rate for male police 
officers (M = £19.19) and female police officers (F = £18.69).

The result has shown that our male police officers are paid an 
average hourly rate of 2.60% higher than our female police 
officers. 

We found the median hourly rate for male police officers (M = 
£18.61) and female police officers (F = £18.32), by placing the 
standard hourly rates of male police officers in ascending order 
and chose the hourly rate which fell in the middle, we then 
repeated this for female police officers. 
We then used the formula provided (M – F) ÷M x 100 to 
determine our Median Pay Gap for our police officer group. 
The result has shown that our male police officers are paid a 
1.56% higher median hourly pay rate than female police officers.

GMP’s Police Staff Gender Pay Gap 

Mean Pay Gap 

 

We calculated average standard hourly rate for male police 
staff (M = £14.59) and female police staff (F = £13.59).

determine our Mean Pay Gap for our police staff group. 
The result has shown that male police staff are paid an 
average hourly rate of 6.85% higher than female police staff. 

We found the median hourly rate for male police staff (M = 
£13.97) and female police staff (F = £13.49), by placing the 
standard hourly rates of male police staff in ascending order 
and chose the hourly rate which fell in the middle, we then 
repeated this for female police staff. 
We then used the formula provided (M – F) ÷M x 100 to 
determine our Median Pay Gap for our police staff group. 
The result has shown that male police staff are paid a median 
hourly rate of 3.44% higher than female police staff.

Action 

GMP is committed to the principles of the Equality Act 2010 and the equal treatment for all Police 
Officers and Police Staff, regardless of their protected characteristics or personal circumstances. 
The causes of a gender pay gap can be many and varied.  Further and more detailed analysis is 
required to fully understand the range of factors which may have had an impact.  This year’s data 
should be seen as a starting point to measure future progress against.  Gender pay gap data will 
not be viewed in isolation but as part of our People Strategy. 

Some of this work will include: 
 

•  attraction and recruitment strategies so we better reflect the gender make up of Greater 

Manchester* 
the progression of female staff through the organisation  

• 
•  access to training, development and promotion; e.g. when working part time or on a 

flexible working plan 
reviewing the retention of female staff e.g. following return from maternity leave 

• 
•  career pathways particularly for police staff where there isn’t always an obvious route 
• 
• 

representation of female staff in what are currently predominantly male roles, and  
reviewing our exit interview process to increase participation and understand why staff 
leave GMP  
 

* Our current workforce gender mix is 41% female and 59% male.  Across the Greater Manchester 
working population this is 47% female and 53% male (ONS, September 2017).   

GMP is committed to reporting what we are doing to reduce the gender pay gap and the progress 
that we are making on an annual basis.
