It has a long and rich tradition of providing a first class education and playing a full role in the wider life of the town.  Conyers Trust was created on 1st November 2016, changing from an Academy Trust founded in 2013 to a Multi Academy Trust (MAT). Multi-academy trusts have different governance arrangements because they are established to oversee and manage more than one academy. They typically have members, trustees, and local governing bodies. At present Conyers Trust consists of Conyers Secondary and Sixth Form and Bader Primary School.
