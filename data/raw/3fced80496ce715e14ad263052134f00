 
Gender pay gap 
report 2017 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Like the majority of UK organisations, change, grow, live has a gender pay gap. 
 
While our gender pay gap is lower than the national average it is still unacceptable. In the coming 
months and years I am committed to reducing the gap by any means possible, with the ultimate 
aim of eliminating it altogether. 
 
Early indicators suggest we are already heading towards this goal. Our new equality, diversity 
and inclusion strategy will enable us to build a more a diverse and representative workforce. It 
will improve our recruitment processes, enhance our retention efforts and provide new 
development opportunities. 
 
We will also work with other organisations to influence factors beyond our direct control such as 
improving women’s representation in the professions that make up part of our workforce and 
encouraging the sector to match our commitment that will help minimise any effect of 
transferring services. 
 
Embracing diversity and providing an inclusive working environment where everyone is 
respected makes us a more effective organisation. The steps we take to reduce the gender pay 
gap will allow us to deliver even better outcomes for our service users. 
 
The data contained in this report is accurate.

Gender pay gap 
 
The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average 
pay within an organisation. 
 
The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay means that men and women in the same 
employment performing equal work must receive equal pay, this is required by law. CGL does not 
breach equal pay legislation. 
 
In the figures below, the mean average is calculated when you add up the pay of all staff and 
divide the figure by the total number of staff. 
 
The median is the figure that sits in the middle when everyone’s pay is lined up from smallest to 
largest. 
 
 
The data set 
 
The pay data of 2,600 employees as of 5 April 2017 was analysed. 
 
1,706 of these staff were women and 894 were men. It includes full-time and part-time staff 
members. It does not include staff members not on the CGL payroll. 
 
23% of staff listed in the pay report were on TUPE terms and conditions.

Pay quartiles 
 
The total staff population was divided into four pay groups each with 650 employees and the 
numbers of men and women calculated in each. The Upper quartile contains the 650 highest 
paid staff members and the lower quarter contains the 650 lowest paid staff members. 
 

 
CGL overall:

          62.9%    37.1% 

          65.2%    34.8%

Lower quartile: 
 
 

 

 

          67.2%    32.8% 

 
 
 
Men are marginally over-represented in the upper and upper middle quartiles whereas women 
are marginally over-represented in the lower and middle quartiles.  
 
This can be attributed to two factors: 

-  Across the UK, part-time and sessional roles are more likely to be held by women than 

men. These roles are more likely to be the lower quartiles with fewer in the upper 
quartiles. 

-  Women are under-represented in more highly-paid professions such as IT and medicine. 

These roles are more likely to be in the upper quartiles.

Bonuses are rare at CGL. 2.0% of women received bonuses compared with 2.8% of men. 
 
Bonuses are either contractual or awarded in exceptional circumstances related to individual 
performance. 
 
CGL’s overall bonus gender pay gap by mean average is 56.4% in favour of men. Our bonus 
gender pay gap by median average is 40.0% in favour of men.

a mean average of 8.4% in favour of men and a median average 14.3% in favour of men. 
 
 
Action plan 
 

-  We will launch a new equality, diversity and inclusion strategy with a commitment to a 

diverse and inclusive workforce. 
 

-  We will continue our investment in learning and development opportunities. 

 

-  We will make changes to our recruitment process so women are better represented - 

guaranteeing women are represented on interview panels and ensuring at least one 
woman is shortlisted for senior leadership roles. 
 

-  We will review our approach to flexible working. 

 

 

 

-  We will extend our training on eliminating unconscious bias. 

 

-  We will launch a new leadership development programme that will encourage 

participation from groups under-represented in leadership roles. 

-  We will review how bonuses are awarded. 

-  Through Collective Voice, we will attempt to influence decision-makers to improve the 

gender balance in professions from which we recruit. 
 

-  We will use our position in the sector to encourage other organisations to match our 

commitment to reducing the gender pay gap and to equality, diversity and inclusion more 
generally.
