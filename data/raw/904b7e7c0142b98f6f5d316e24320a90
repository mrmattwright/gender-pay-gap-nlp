Each of our care homes across England and South Wales provides residents with relationship – centred care, placing the individual’s needs at the very centre of the care we provide. With help from family and friends, every resident completes ‘About Me’ – a life story booklet which aids reminiscence and helps with planning appropriate, engaging activities. Our highly trained team support residents to keep on doing things they’ve always loved – the things they perhaps thought they could no longer enjoy. So as part of our communities, residents are able to help out in the garden, cook and carry on with the kind of everyday routines which make their lives… theirs. Well why not? Enter your postcode, town or county into the search bar above to find your nearest Hallmark care home.
