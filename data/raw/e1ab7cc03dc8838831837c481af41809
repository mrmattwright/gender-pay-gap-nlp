2017 Gender Pay Gap ReportUnderstand 
The Results

The analysis of our gender gap figures 
tell us that women are paid a slightly 
higher hourly rate than men, despite 
the majority of our workforce being 
male.

As you’d expect from a business that was listed in 
the Sunday Times Top 25 Best Big Companies to Work 
For in 2016 and 2017, we put people at the heart of 
everything we do. By continually nurturing our talent, 
we provide the platform and opportunity for an 
amazing career with DPD for all employees.

Next Steps

We care about building an environment where all employees 
have access to the same opportunities. We’ll continue our work 
towards this in two areas:

1.

2.

Recruitment

Development Opportunities

Ensuring we select the right person 
for the job, through fair and balanced 
processes 

Ensuring merit alone determines 
who our future leaders are
