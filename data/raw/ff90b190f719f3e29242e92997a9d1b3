Introduction

At Infosys, we recognize the need for greater Diversity and Inclusion
at the workplace, and on this journey, we place special emphasis on 
enabling gender diversity. Women form an integral part our of 
company and we do all that we can to build an inclusive, supportive 
and safe workplace for them. 

We value our women, who form over 36% of our global workforce. 
As we include more gender balance in our workforce we expect our 
pay gap to reduce. This includes our competitive pay structure. 

Our comprehensive Diversity and Inclusion strategy, with its strong 
focus on gender, is powered by a supportive leadership and is 
making strides at the workplace. We will keep marching on, to 
strengthen our strategy and drive positive outcomes.

reduce this gender imbalance.

Our aim going forward is to achieve a year on 

year improvement in our gender pay gap. We 

hope that as we strive to achieve greater gender
