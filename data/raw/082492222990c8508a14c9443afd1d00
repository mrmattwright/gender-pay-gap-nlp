Foreword

At Funding Circle, our people are our 
business; they are what makes the 
business stronger every day. The 
exceptional experience we aim to  
deliver to our customers is the product 
of the smart, talented, hardworking 
and diverse group of Circlers we have 
working here. We recognise the power 
and value in building a diverse team, 
where people’s skills and personalities 
complement each other and reflect 
the customers we are here to help. 
Different perspectives lead to better 
outcomes and we see the positive 
impact of this in our teams every day.

Women and men are always paid 
equally at Funding Circle for performing 
the same roles. Over the last year 
however, we have looked closely at 
gender diversity within our business, 
as we strive to achieve an increasing-
ly diverse team. This report sets out 
our proposals to achieve this aim, as 
well as our calculations on the current 
gender pay gap.

Our gender pay gap of 24% is a result 
of a lower proportion of women in 
senior and mid level roles. Funding 
Circle is a financial technology or ‘Fin-
Tech’ business, and both the financial 
services and technology sectors have 
traditionally experienced especially 
low levels of gender diversity. Tackling 
this will be a key focus for us over the 
coming years. We have set ourselves 
an ambitious target of increasing the 
proportion of senior management 
who are women from 28% to 40% by 
the end of 2020, and will update on 
our progress against this each year. 

We are pleased that we have an even 
gender split at entry levels.

Our Global Leadership Team also has 
a good level of diversity, particularly 
for the financial services and tech-
nology sectors, and is made up of 
five women and eight men. We know 
there is still more to do however and 
whilst we actively hire the best talent, 
we are constantly looking to hire and 
retain more women, especially in our 
engineering team. 

We are proud that people want to 
work here. Our aim is to be the best 
FinTech company to work for in the 
world; creating an environment where 
people from all backgrounds feel sup-
ported is critical to this. That is why 
we have always recruited, reviewed 
and compensated our people against 
Funding Circle’s core values including 
Be Open and, Stand Together.

We believe this has a hugely positive 
impact on the culture at Funding 
Circle and our quarterly survey tells 
us that people enjoy working here, 
with 87% saying they would recom-
mend Funding Circle to a friend. We 
were also pleased that Funding Circle 
came 16th in the 2018 Sunday Times 
Best Places to Work list. By focusing 
on building greater gender diversity 
across the whole organisation, we 
will continue to build on this and I 
look forward to updating you on our 
progress.

Measuring the pay gap

Funding Circle employs approximately 
400 people in the UK. In this report 
we are sharing the mean and median 
average pay gaps between women 
and men’s hourly pay and bonuses in 
the UK, for the year ending April 2017.

The UK Government has introduced a 
new policy to support the progression 
of more women into senior roles in 
business and society. All organisa-
tions with more than 250 employees 
are required to report their ‘Gender 
Pay Gap’, which shows the percentage 
difference in average hourly pay 
between women and men.

The Pay Gap percentage is positive 
when the average male across the 
whole business is paid more than the 
average female, and negative when 
the opposite is the case.

It does not measure 
equal pay, which 
relates to what 
women and men 
are paid for the 
same or similar jobs 
or work of equal 
value. 

Our analysis has 
shown that everyone 
is paid equally for 
equivalent roles.

Understanding our pay gap

The mean Gender Pay Gap across 
Funding Circle is +24% and the median 
is +36%. The gap is driven by a lower 
proportion of women in senior and mid 
level roles; 28% of our senior manage-

ment is female compared to 37% for 
the whole UK team. The below chart 
shows hourly salary split into four 
equally sized groups or ‘quartiles’. The 
highest paid people (quartile D) are 

typically the most senior and it is here 
where we see the highest proportion 
of men versus women. The majority of 
our team, 80%, do not receive a bonus. 
The mean bonus gap of +60% and 

median bonus gap of +50% is driven 
by a higher proportion of men being 
in teams with higher bonuses, as well 
as a higher proportion of men within 
senior roles in bonus earning teams.

At Funding Circle 63% of our team are 
men and 37% are women in the UK. 
This is in part due to a large number 
of engineering roles being held by 
men. Funding Circle is a Financial 
Technology or ‘FinTech’ business, 
and both the financial services and 
technology sectors have traditionally 
experienced especially low levels of 
gender diversity. 

On average 25% of senior roles in the 
financial services sector are held by 
women.* More recently, much pro-
gress has been made to encourage 
women into more STEM-based roles 
and improvements have been made. 
However, there is more to be done, 
and we are committed to identifying 
ways to help overcome any barriers to 
achieving greater diversity within our 
business.

Closing the gap

We will also provide diversity training 
and support to all Circlers for when 
they are recruiting or assessing talent, 
to help them build teams that are as 
diverse as possible. Beyond gender, 
we are committed to embracing di-
versity and inclusion so that everyone 
has equal opportunities. 

We have set ourselves an ambitious 
target of increasing the proportion of 
senior management who are women 
from 28% to 40% by the end of 2020, 
where the proportion of women 
across the entire UK team is currently 
37%. Each member of our Global 
Leadership Team has also agreed to 
internal targets for their respective 
business areas. 

First and foremost, we will always hire 
the best talent and reward Circlers 
based on merit. This is critically 
important as we will only achieve our 
vision of building a better financial 
world if we have the world’s best tal-
ent. However to obtain the power and 
value from a more diverse team, we 
are committed to delivering current 
and new initiatives to improve how we 
attract, engage and develop women.

Women in Finance Charter
Funding Circle has signed up to the 
government’s Women in Finance 
Charter which is a commitment to 
support the progression of wom-
en into senior roles in the financial 
services sector. As part of this, James 
Meekings, co-founder and UK Man-
aging Director is taking responsibility 
and accountability for gender diversity 
and inclusion at Funding Circle in the 
UK. 

Diversity and Inclusion Leadership
We have established a UK Diversity 
and Inclusion Leadership Team, that 
will be led by James Meekings, and 
will set the strategic agenda for the 
year and ensure progress is being 
made against our targets. They will 
work with our People team to drive 
forward a number of initiatives aimed 
at improving gender diversity at the 
senior and mid-tier levels, including:
•  Getting our hiring right: working 

with the Talent & Recruitment team 
to ensure gender balance is a key 
consideration in designing and 
managing the recruitment process.

•  Fostering our talent: working with 

the People and Learning & 
Development teams to ensure 
our top talent, male and female, 
receives tailored mentoring and 
coaching, creating an environment 
where everyone can access the 
help and tools they need to build 
their careers.

Women @ Funding Circle
We have established a grassroots 
Women@FundingCircle group that 
will be led by Lisa Jacobs, our Chief 
Strategy Officer, and made up of 
men and women from across the 
business, with the aim of creating an 
environment for women to succeed 
professionally and personally across 
all levels at Funding Circle.

This group will create an active and 
supportive community within Funding 
Circle in which women and men 
can connect, share and encourage 
one another to reach their goals. 
It will also raise the awareness of 
the importance of gender diversity 
and showcase the work of women 
within Funding Circle and the broader 
industry. Finally, it will partner with 
the Learning and Development team 
to provide opportunities to develop 
industry needed skill sets and aid 
career development.
