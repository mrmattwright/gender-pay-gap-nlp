Positive experience. West Berkshire Community Ophthalmology Service Best customer service I’ve had from the NHS. Amazing. Thank you!       Since 2005, The Practice Group has worked with the NHS to design and deliver innovative approaches to primary care across England. Working with Clinical Commissioning Groups, clinicians from The Practice Group deliver well over a million patient appointments per year. Some of these appointments are with patients from a registered list of over 200,000 patients, but The Practice Group also delivers 120 community outpatient clinics per week providing a range of services including Ophthalmology and Dermatology.  Many of the teams working with The Practice Group are delivering care in difficult and challenging environments. Patient care is always locally designed and involves patient groups and significant input from NHS teams.  The Practice Group is proud to provide tailor made and unique solutions for local healthcare challenges. For example; running GP clinics for street homeless populations, providing care for patients excluded from mainstream provision, delivering services into secure institutions and designing and delivering new care models for residents of care homes.  The Practice Group has strong clinical leadership from the same GPs who founded the organisation and there is a clear focus on providing better health outcomes at lower costs. In this way, The Practice Group creates real value for the NHS and consistent and sustainable long-term care for its patients.
