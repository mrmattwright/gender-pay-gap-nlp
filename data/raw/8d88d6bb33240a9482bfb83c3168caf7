Mandatory Gender Pay Gap Reporting – Bolton School 
 
Gender Pay Reporting, under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, 
involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of males 
and  females  working  at  the  Bolton  School  Foundation;  it  does  not  involve  publishing  individual 
employee’s data. 
 
The figures that need to be published on the Government website are as follows; 
 
Mean gender pay gap 
Median gender pay gap 
Mean bonus gender pay gap 
Median bonus gender pay gap 
Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment 
Proportion of males and females in each quartile band 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
The  data  used  for  the  mean  and  median  gender  pay  gap  calculations  is  based  on  the  payroll  that 
included the snapshot date of 5 April 2017. The data used for the bonus figure calculations is based 
on the 12 months reference period to 5 April 2017. 
 
The data used was for 590 members of staff, 179 being male and 411 being female. 

Due to the diversity of the contracts at the Foundation, where salaries are based on a known hourly 
rate, e.g. NJC payscale hourly rates this figure was used to make comparisons equal. For example, we 
have a number of support staff who have term time only contracts and do not work across a full year. 
Their salary is paid on an annualised basis but this would have skewed the results if we didn’t use their 
actual hourly rate. After some discussion in house and with our lawyer, and in the absence of a number 
of hours to be worked per week in the Teacher contract, it was decided to use the guidance which was 
issued from ISBA at the end of February 2018. 

Teaching staff are paid in accordance with the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document where 
salary is dependent on length of service and experience. Support staff are paid according to the NJC 
payscales, and roles are regularly benchmarked across the organisation and externally. 
 
The Results: 
 
Mean and Median Gender Pay Gap 
 
The mean figure is the difference between the average hourly rate for male and female employees. 
This  has  been  calculated  as  16.25%,  meaning  that  the  average  hourly  rate  for  females  within  the 
Foundation is, on average 16.25% less than that for male employees.  
 
The median  figure is the  difference between the middle hourly rate, when all the  hourly rates are 
listed  in  numerical  order,  separately  for  male  and  female  employees.  This  has  been  calculated  as 
40.61% which means that for females within the Foundation, their hourly pay is 40.61% lower than 
that for male employees. 
 
This does highlight the fact that, as with many organisations there is a gender pay gap.

To  assist  with  our  analysis  of  the  data,  we  have  analysed  each  quartile  further  and  evaluated  the 
different job roles in each quartile. This data is below and it can be seen that in the upper middle 
quartile the men’s hourly rate is actually less than the women’s.

There are a number of reasons why the overall, headline figure of 16.25% reflects female employees 
being paid less compared to male employees. The gender gap is driven by the under-representation 
of men in the lower quartile roles within the Foundation.  The majority of the roles in the lower quartile 
are  Catering  Assistants,  Cleaners,  Playcare  Assistants  and  Nursery  Nurses  which  are  traditionally 
female dominated. In the lower quartile there are 22 males compared to 126 females and 30.7% of all 
females employed by the Foundation are employed in a role that falls in the lower quartile.  
 
The  Foundation  also  has  a  number  of  salary  sacrifice  schemes  available  to  members  of  staff  for 
childcare vouchers,  school  fees  and the Group Personal  Pension.  According to the  ACAS  guidance, 
hourly  rates  are  to  be  calculated  after  any  salary  sacrifice  arrangements  have  taken  place.  By 
calculating  hourly  rates  post  salary  sacrifice,  the  hourly  rate  of  pay  has  been  decreased  but  the 
employee is gaining another benefit in lieu of their salary. There are proportionately more females 
using salary sacrifice arrangements, and a number of these have decreased their hourly rate by a large 
percentage which also affects the results. Due to this a number of women are in a lower quartile than 
they would ordinarily be in compared to their pre-salary sacrifice hourly rate.

During the 12 month reference period to 5 April 2017, four members of staff received a payment that 
fell into the criteria of a bonus payment according to the regulations. All of these bonuses were to 
managers who work in the commercial sector of the Foundation and this scheme has since been closed 
such that no further bonus payments will be made.  
 
A £100 award is payable to all members of staff once they have accrued 25 years’ service, however 
we have chosen not to include the long service awards in the bonus data. 
 
After analysing the data, we believe that there is not a gender pay issue regarding the payment of 
bonuses.
