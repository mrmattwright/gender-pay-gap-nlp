We have prepared this gender pay gap reporting in accordance with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  As required under those Regulations, this report, published in 2018, is based on data from April 2017.      Gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017  PPL’s workforce in April 2017 consisted of 342 FTE (54% male and 46% female).   PPL’s gender pay gap statistics for the pay period that included 5 April 2017 are set out below:          In the above, a positive figure means the gap is in favour of men; a negative figure means the gap is in favour of women.   PPL’s mean gender pay gap is 6.6% in favour of men. In a company our size, the pay for roles at the most senior level can impact our statistics if there are more men than women in those roles.  For example, our mean gender pay gap is reduced to 2.7% in favour of men if the CEO is excluded.  PPL’s median gender pay gap is 4.3% in favour of women.  PPL’s mean gender bonus gap is 36.5% in favour of men. Again this can be impacted by the ratio of men to women in more senior roles. Excluding PPL’s CEO from the figures, the mean gender bonus gap drops to 15.4% in favour of men.  PPL’s median gender bonus gap is 4.7% in favour of women.  The proportion of male and female employees receiving a bonus is 84.2% and 82.8% respectively.   PPL operates a bonus scheme that is based initially on company performance. In the event that company performance targets are met such that a bonus is payable, the amount an individual receives is then based on performance and therefore the pay-out will vary based on both an individual’s salary and performance rating.  Of those individuals who received the highest performance rating in 2016 (affecting bonuses paid in 2017), 50% were male and 50% were female.  Pay Quartiles   For reference, according to Office for National Statistics data, the median gender pay gap across the UK in 2017, for employees in full time roles, was 9.1% in favour of men.  We confirm the Gender Pay Gap data contained in this report is accurate.
