As of April 2017, all companies with 250 or more employees are now required to publish their Gender Pay Gap under new government legislation. Charities have to report on the pay gap by a specific date - the 5 April 2017. Addaction’s overall gender pay gap on 5 April 2017 by mean average was 8.6% and by median average 0.9% in favour of men. This represents the difference between the average salaries of women and men across our total workforce. This data shows that our Gender Pay Gap is better than the national average. However, we are committed to taking action to reduce this gap. Here is our report explaining the gender pay gap .
