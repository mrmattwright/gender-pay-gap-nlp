As  a  private  company  employing  over  250  people  on  the  snapshot  date  indicated  above  we  are 
required by law to publish the following data, known as “Gender Pay Gap Reporting”. 
 
Please  note  that  the  gender  pay  gap  is  not  the  same  as  equal  pay.  Equal  pay  deals  with  the  pay 
differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value, 
whereas the gender pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women. 

 

 
I confirm that the data reported is accurate.
