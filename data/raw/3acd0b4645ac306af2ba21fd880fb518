Gender Pay Gap Report

April 2017

Introduction

Premiere Employment Group Limited, which trades as Premiere People NI in 
Northern Ireland is a multi-sector recruitment business..  

We welcome the opportunity to publish our gender pay gap report, which has 
been taken from the pay details of the 3,116 colleagues we paid in the pay 
period within which the 5th April 2017 fell (referred to under the relevant 
regulations as the “snapshot date”), of which 48.2% were female, and 51.8% 
were male.  

In the interests of transparency, our report also provides a separate gender 
pay gap analysis for our 51 salaried colleagues as over 98% of the staff we 
paid in the relevant pay period were our temporary colleagues, whose pay 
rates are set by the clients they work for. 

As part of our transition to becoming a social enterprise, we are also 
developing a good job strategy which will focus on how we can create and 
maximise a positive social impact.  As we develop these strategies and 
integrate them into our future business plans, we will take into account our 
gender pay gap data, ensuring diversity and inclusion remains a key focus 
area for the future. 

I confirm the information and data reported within this report and submitted 
via the Government Equalities Office gender pay gap reporting service is 
accurate as of the snapshot date 5 April 2017.

Understanding our gender pay gap report

How is the gender pay gap measured?
There are four key measures:

● Mean hourly pay and bonus pay gap
● Median hourly pay and bonus pay gap
●

Proportion of males / females that received a bonus in the 12 month 
period ending on the snapshot date
Proportion of males / females in each quartile pay band

●

How is the mean hourly pay gap calculated?
The mean pay gap is expressed as a percentage and shows the difference in 
the average hourly rate of pay between male and female colleagues.  This is 
calculated by adding up the hourly rates of pay for all females, and dividing 
this by the number of females, and doing the same calculation for men. The 
percentage is then calculated by taking the average hourly rate for females 
from the average hourly rate for males, and multiplying the result by 100.

How is the median hourly pay gap calculated?
Firstly, you rank all female employees in order of their hourly pay rate (highest 
to lowest). You then find the hourly rate of pay belonging to the female that is 
in the middle of the list. If there is an odd number of female colleagues in the 
list the middle person will be easy to find e.g. if 105 females then use the 
hourly pay rate for the female ranked at number 53. If there is an even 
number of female colleagues, then you find the middle two and calculate the 
average hourly rate of the two e.g. if 110 employees, you calculate the average 
hourly rate of pay for the female colleagues ranked 55 and 56 in the list. 

The same calculation is undertaken for male colleagues, with the median 
hourly pay gap expressed as a percentage by taking the median hourly pay 
rate for females from the median hourly pay rate for males and multiplying by 
100.

How is the mean and median bonus pay gap calculated?
The same as the mean and median hourly pay gaps (see above), but instead 
looking at the differences in the mean and median values in relation to the 
amount  of bonus paid in the 12 month period ending on the snapshot date to 
male and female colleagues. 

Understanding our gender pay gap report

What do the percentage pay gaps actually mean?

They effectively show how much more male colleagues earn in comparison to 
females in relation to average hourly rates of pay and average annual bonus 
payments, or vice versa. 

If the percentage gap is a positive number it means, on average,  our male 
colleagues have a higher rate of pay and / or level of bonus payments than 
females. If the percentage gap is shown as a negative number, it means, on 
average, our female colleagues have a higher rate of pay and / or level of 
bonus pay than their male colleagues.

Important Note

The gender pay gaps  look at comparing the pay data for all male and female 
colleagues regardless of their job role, so is not the same and should not be 
considered to show that an employer is breaching equal pay rights, which 
focus on ensuring male and female colleagues receive the same rate of pay for 
doing the same or broadly similar job role.

What are the quartile pay bands?
This is calculated by ranking all colleagues, regardless of their gender, from 
the colleague(s) with the highest hourly pay rate in the organisation to the 
colleague(s) with the lowest hourly pay rate.  

This list is then divided into four quarters, with as equal number of employees 
in each quartile as possible. 

The report then shows the proportion of males and females in each of the 
following pay quartiles:

● Upper 
● Upper middle
●
Lower middle
●
Lower

Our results for 2017

The first table (right) shows the mean 
and median hourly pay and bonus pay 
gap for all staff paid in the relevant pay 
period, which includes 3,065 (c.98%) 
hourly paid temporary colleagues, of 
which c.48% are female and c.52% male, 
and whose pay rates are set by the 
clients they work for. 

Although the overall proportion of 
females in the whole workforce is 
almost equal to that of males, females 
represent over 78% of the salaried 
workforce, that populate the higher pay 
quartiles, which has contributed to the 
positive pay gap differentials and 
significant median bonus pay gap, even 
though the second table (right) shows 
that across the whole workforce, male 
staff are almost three times more likely 
to be paid a bonus.

As the data above is affected by the 
large volume of our temporary 
colleagues, the two further tables 
to the left have been provided 
which show the same data analysis 
as above, but using only the data 
for our 51 salaried staff.   
The pay gaps shown are quite large 
in favour of males, however this is 
due to Premiere People being a 
relatively small business with one 
male senior employee leading our 
main Belfast which has impacted 
the mean and median pay gaps 
significantly, 

Our results for 2017

The charts below show the percentage of male and female colleagues that are contained 
within each pay quartile band.  There are two sets of charts, one for all staff (as required 
by the regulations), and the other for our salaried for our salaried colleagues only (N.B 
there are no salaried staff employed within the lower pay quartile.)
Almost all salaried staff sit within the upper two pay quartiles, with females representing 
77% of the full-pay salaried staff population and therefore showing females as having a 
greater representation within these quartiles, albeit overall salaried male staff achieve a 
higher average rate of pay and bonus pay for the reason outlined on the previous page.
