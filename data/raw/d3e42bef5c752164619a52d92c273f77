We will endeavour to improve this position and this year we made changes to our pay scales after the data was captured which should further improve the balance of our pay between genders. Our mean gender pay gap is 6.95% which equates to 80p and our median gender pay gap is -9.48% which equates to -96p. We are confident that we pay men and women equally for doing the same job. We recognise that there is no room for complacency and we will continue to strive to address any imbalance. Our other data is as follows: Gender Pay Quartiles Band A (lowest Paid) Band B Band C Band D (highest paid) Male - 43.28% Male - 39.78% Male - 27.07% Male - 43.52% Female - 56.72% Female - 60.22% Female - 72.93% Female - 51.48%  Bonus Pay Mean Gender Bonus Gap Median Gender Bonus Gap Proportion of Male employees receiving a bonus Proportion of Female employees receiving a bonus 0% 0% 0% 0%         Updated: 31 Jan 2018                     A to Z of services   A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I    J    K    L    M    N    O    P    Q    R    S    T    U    V    W    X    Y    Z       Contact us    Cookies Policy    Emergency Contacts    Privacy Notice    Terms and Conditions    Site Map    Emergency out of hours                                           © 2018 New Forest District Council      Tell us what you think about our site...
