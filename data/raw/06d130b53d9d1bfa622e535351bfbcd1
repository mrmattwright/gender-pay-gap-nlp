Difference in hourly rate of pay – mean 43.82% Difference in hourly rate of pay – median 41.12% Difference in bonus pay – ​mean 33.57% Difference in bonus pay – median 76.83% Percentage of employees who received bonus pay Males 88.46% Females 57.80% Employees by pay quartile Upper quartile - Male 87.50% Female12.50% Upper middle quartile - Male 62.50% Female 37.50% Lower middle quartile - Male 45.83% Female 54.17% Lower quartile - Male 20.00% Female 80.00% The company’s workforce is organised into administration and direct sales divisions. In administration 50% of the workforce is female but in the sales division it drops to 27%. The most noticeable differences come from structural issues around the roles women are employed in. A higher proportion of female employees working less hours receive bonus/commission proportionately less but the calculation for the gender bonus gap does not allow any adjustment to bring these payments back to their full time equivalent level. Both men and women are encouraged to work flexibly, the majority of those currently doing so are female, and it appears a lack of women in senior and highest paid positions is the most obvious reason for the difference. Tackling the gender pay gap will take time and a need to focus on improving gender diversity through a workplace environment and culture that supports and empowers women. Role models throughout the business in senior leadership roles are encouraging and supporting other females to develop.
