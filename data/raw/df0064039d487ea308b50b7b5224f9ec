Women in Finance Charter  Since July 2016, Direct Line Group has been a signatory of the Women in Finance Charter. The Charter is a commitment by HM Treasury and signatory firms to work collaboratively to build a more balanced and diverse industry. We have committed to increase the female representation of senior management to 30% by the end of 2019.   To fulfil our Charter pledge we have:   Implemented a people scorecard to assess Executives’ performance against a number of people related metrics and deliverables, of which the Women in Finance Charter is one and this links to Annual Incentive Plan outcomes  Committed to gender balanced shortlists within senior recruitment  Focussed on identifying our high-potential females  Initiated a specific development programme for high potential females in middle and senior management role  Invested in an external leadership benchmarking programme to build individual development plans   We are making good progress to meet our targets; women now account for 24.63% of our senior management * , and we believe the pledge will also help us to address our gender pay gap.  * As of 31st December 2017  Gender Pay Gap  As of 5 th April 2017, our median gender pay gap* is 14.7%.  Our pay and bonus gaps reflect the distribution of women across all areas of the business. We are already focussed on actively supporting the professional development of our female talent and have a number of initiatives in place to maximise their career potential and contribution to Direct Line Group. We are determined to reduce these gaps and promote an inclusive culture which values the contribution from women and men, and believe we are in a strong position to do so.
