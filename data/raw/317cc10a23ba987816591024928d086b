This Gender Pay Gap Report is based on data as at 5/4/2017. At this date we employed 324 people, 187 were male and 137 female.  We are committed to the principles of Equal pay for all employees, and have always benchmarked our salaries and pay rates carefully against the Fresh Produce sector, and the wider Food & Drink industry.  We feel equal pay is a moral and ethical obligation, not just a legal right, and strive to eliminate any gender bias in our pay and remuneration systems.  Since April 2017 we have promoted an additional female to our Executive team, recruited another female to our Senior Management team, and two further females to management positions. Within an industry which is heavily male dominated at managerial level, we are pleased and proud to report this.  The information we are required to publish is detailed below:     Mean pay gap - 29.15%    Median pay gap – 1.57%    Mean Bonus pay gap - 75.48%    Median Bonus pay gap – 0%    Males receiving bonus – 84.5%    Females receiving bonus – 85.4%          1 st Quartile – 76.54% male, 23.46% female    2 nd Quartile – 59.26% male, 40.74% female    3 rd Quartile – 55.56% male, 44.44% female    4 th Quartile – 39.51% male, 60.49% female       For many years we have ensured pay and benefits are harmonised in comparable roles and are confident we achieve this.  During 2018 we are introducing a new Job Evaluation scheme to further assist us in ensuring we offer a fair and equitable remuneration package. This scheme enables us to benchmark roles against other industries outside of Food & Drink.  We also strive to encourage more females to join our industry, by demonstrating flexible working and putting family friendly policies into practice.  We are pleased to report we have a number of females on development pathways who will take professional and managerial roles in the future. We also support a number of industry initiatives which are inclusive and work towards attracting female talent to this exciting and vibrant sector.              back to top                           Modern Slavery Statement                 All Content Copyright Worldwide Fruit 2013   Site creation: Smart Hospitality
