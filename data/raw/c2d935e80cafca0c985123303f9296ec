In what we believe is a hugely positive move for the entire UK business community, the government now requires that all employers with over 250 employees publish their gender pay gap data. MediaCom UK falls into this category.   Gender Pay Gap FAQ  What is The Gender Pay Gap?  The Gender Pay Gap provides details of the gender balance within an organisation. It measures the difference between the average earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of their role or seniority.  How is The Gender Pay Gap different from Equal Pay?  The Gender Pay Gap looks at the mean and median pay regardless of the roles performed. As different jobs pay different salaries and the number of men and women performing these jobs varies, a marginal gender pay gap will almost always exist.  This is different from Equal Pay , which is the difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs.  The statistics contained in this report do not represent Equal Pay status.  What is the Mean and Median Gap?  The Mean Pay Gap is the average. The mean pay gap is the difference in the average hourly rate of pay between all men and women.  The Median Pay Gap is the middle. To explain this, imagine that all employees were lined up in a female line and a male line, from lowest to highest in terms of rate of pay. The female and male in the middle of each line are compared. This is what gives us the media gender pay gap.   MediaCom UK Gender Pay Gap statistics (all statistics are from April 2017)  At MediaCom UK, we are committed to rewarding all of our people fairly, regardless of their gender, age, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation.  We ensure equal pay across our organisation, with bands that are specific to the role performed and experience of employees and candidates considered for them.  In the UK, the national average median pay gap currently stands at 18.4% (Source: ONS).  However, at MediaCom UK, which includes MediaCom Holdings (our employees based in London) and MediaCom North (our employees based in Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds), the median gender pay gap is at 13.8% (based on data collected in April 2017).  Within our specific offices, MediaCom Holdings has a median gender pay gap of 11.1%. MediaCom North has a median pay gap of 15.7%. These figures are all lower than the national average.  When we collected the data (April 2017), more than 80% of MediaCom UK’s workforce hold entry-level to mid-management-level job roles. The mean Gender Pay Gap for this population is 2% . The median Gender Pay Gap is 2.9%.   MediaCom UK’s plan for the future  It is our mission to continue reducing the gap to the point where it simply does not exist.  We aim to achieve gender balance across all levels of our company by 2023 and we hope to achieve this using the following strategies:   Ensuring gender-neutral hiring opportunities , by considering an equal number of male and female candidates for all senior leadership positions.  Preventing hiring bias , by ensuring every hiring panel is 50% male and 50% female.  Eliminating unconscious bias , launching unconscious bias training for every employee, not just in the UK, but globally. This training is taking place in 2018.  Welcoming women back, we commit to making it easier for women to blend work and life so that they feel empowered to stay at MediaCom   To learn more about MediaCom UK’s gender pay data, download our 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report here .  Notes:   MediaCom UK is made up of two legal entities: MediaCom Holdings, which accounts for all employees based in London; and MediaCom North, which accounts for all employed based in Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham.  MediaCom Holdings includes our UK London agency and MediaCom Worldwide employees based in London. MediaCom Worldwide is a global company in 105 countries around the world. In April 2017 a significant proportion of MediaCom’s World Wide Global Board (which includes the most senior male leaders in the entire organisation) were based in London. As their salaries were processed by MediaCom Holdings payroll department, we have included these figures in our responses. These figures have inflated the gender pay gap percentages in some instances.           diversity  insight  people   Download article PDF   Signup     Share  Twitter  LinkedIn  Linked In  Google +  Email       Signup     Share  Twitter  LinkedIn  Linked In  Google +  Email     Next  MediaCom presents BLINK: Meet your Future    Previous  MediaCom chosen for multi-million UK Brief for dating brand Match        Continue Exploring  reports            MediaCom UK receives top marks in Campaign School Report 2018  clients  new business  recognition         MediaCom triumphs at Campaign Media Awards 2018  award winning  clients         MediaCom retains Sky business after comprehensive review  clients  media  new business         MediaCom Sport & Entertainment triumphs at UK Sponsorship Awards 2018  award winning  recognition  sport and entertainment              X       Previous  Next       X      Speakers            Web  Connect   Twitter  Linked In       Previous  Next          Facebook    Twitter    LinkedIn    Sign up for updates  Career Opportunities      Contact  Terms of use  Privacy policy  Sitemap  Our parent group     © Copyright 2018 MediaCom        MediaCom uses cookies on this website.
