While other schools locally are adjusting to their recent move to a two-tier system, our schools are already established and very confident with the forward looking All-Through system. As a result, all the schools in our Trust are able to focus solely on our core mission of helping every pupil to reach his or her potential by providing a seamless education from 4-19.  If you are interested in understanding our approach better, you can read more about how the Trust works .  To visit a Trust school web site click on the links at the top of the page.        Trust events    The Evening of Dance The Trust’s PE and Dance specialists have worked for weeks with our coordinator, Mrs Stoten, to prepare for this annual event. Well over a hundred performers created a fantastic show with all the creativity, variety, discipline and professionalism for which our dance is renowned. Every campus provided its own pieces, there were a number of cross-phase items and the show opened and closed with Trust numbers involving every performer. The audience loved the whole evening and we congratulate all who took part. We thank all the staff who helped and, especially, Mrs Stoten for producing such a vibrant, highquality show. The Able and Talented Musicians Day We were delighted to welcome a team from Aldeburgh to work with the most talented musicians in the middle phase and years nine and ten at County. The musicians had both composition and playing workshops. By the end of the day, the pupils had written a piece which they then performed. The pupils demonstrated an excellent standard and thoroughly enjoyed the day. They were congratulated by the team from Aldeburgh who we thank, together with Mr Jermy our Trust Music Co-ordinator and Miss Green for making it possible. Astronomy in Action In what has become an annual event, science staff from the Trust joined forces with the renowned Astrophysics department at the University of Hertfordshire to run an evening for families across our age range. This year the university brought its large pop-up planetarium and successfully stationed it on the County Upper astroturf. It was fully booked with two hundred and forty visitors and they were joined by more than a hundred other guests to enjoy the remaining activities. These included viewing the night sky through a powerful telescope, building an orrery, a star chart and a rocket, using spectroscopy and much more! The Trust’s science ambassadors were excellent all evening and much complimented by our visitors.  We thank them and the science staff led by Mr Western for an excellent evening.      Trust News    Head Students in the Community During half term, the Head Students from County Upper and Horringer Court accepted an invitation to our Trust to meet Lord Bristol, Chairman of the Trustees of the The Ickworth Church Conservation Trust which was founded in 2006 by the Marquess of Bristol to restore and safeguard the church and churchyard. Ben Amroota, Maisie Finch and Rebecca Severy represented the Trust and met The Marquess of Bristol, together with the Reverend Christopher Griffiths, Simon Pott and other representatives from Ickworth . All three were excellent ambassadors for the Trust. We thank them together with Mrs Kemp who accompanied them. Trust ambassadors meet Jo Churchill, MP Across the Trust, we continue to run gardening clubs and older students often help younger ones to improve their green fingered skills. One special project was instigated by Bury in Bloom and the Borough Council. Pupils across the primary, middle and upper phases were selected to redesign the flower displays in St Olave’s precinct. The pupils started with a workshop from which they designed and made permanent planters. They then selected the plants to go in them to ensure a continuous display.  This half term a special planting ceremony took place with our MP, Jo Churchill, Councillor David Nettleton and other civic dignitaries. Students from across the Trust were invited and did an excellent job of confidently explaining their project to the guests.  We thank all who took part on being exemplary ambassadors for our Trust and congratulate them on an excellent project. The Trust is featured on the BBC Throughout the day on the 30th January, the BBC ran a feature on the arts in schools. It followed the largest survey of arts provision in the country, the results of which demonstrated that a combination of focussing on only the core subjects and funding cuts is leading to much reduced arts provision for middle and upper phase-aged children.  During the breakfast, lunch, early evening and late evening news, the Trust was featured as an example of how to buck the trend. Excerpts from the Trust’s drama festival, dance and music featured on all the bulletins together with clips from an interview with Mrs Neale. The clear message given was that the Trust provides high quality education across the arts subjects whilst also excelling in the academic core. This had been demonstrated just a few days before when performance data in the most rigorous measure across English, mathematics, science, humanities and languages was published, confirming that County Upper is sixteen percentage points above national and almost twenty percentage points above Suffolk.  It is good to see the Trust’s excellent work receive this recognition; well done everyone!
