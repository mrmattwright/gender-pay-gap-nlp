1 || Agincare gender pay gap reporting

At  Agincare,  we  pride  ourselves  on 
an  established  history  of  delivering 
quality  care  for  over  30  years,  with  a 
growing  workforce,  representative  of 
the  communities  we  work  within.  We 
employ  people  in  our  head  office  in 
Portland, Dorset and across the country 
from around 50 locations.
We  are  a  family-owned  care  provider 
and  have  had  many  people  join  us 
over the years and stay to develop their 
careers with us, many of them starting 
at frontline care delivery level. We have 
always  been  committed  to  employing 
a  diverse  workforce,  working  within 
a  framework  governed  by  changing 
legislation,  policy  and  good  practice 
guidance.
As a social care provider, we operate in 
a  sector  which  has  traditionally  seen 
a  higher  representation  of  women 
employed.  Roles  at  a  frontline  level  in 
social care (ie providing direct care in a 
care home or in a person’s own home 
in the community) are often part-time 
and involve flexible working hours.

Our gender pay gap data

Of  our  Agincare  UK  home  care 
workforce  of  circa  1400  people  (April 
2017),  women  comprise:  81.4% 
in 
frontline care positions, 84.3% in salaried 
positions relating to care provision and 
75% in senior management or director 
positions.  The  career  progression 
that  we  positively  encourage  in  our 
existing  workforce  has  assisted  us 
in  maintaining  positive  figures  with 
regards  to  women  in  senior  positions. 
Of  our  Agincare  Live-in  Care  Services 
workforce  of  circa  340  people  (April 
2017),  women  comprise:  71.1% 
in 
frontline care positions, 75% in salaried 
positions relating to care provision and 
25% in senior management or director 
positions.
What  is  the  gender  pay  gap  report 
and why are we publishing it?
Legislation now requires us to publish 
details  of  the  gender  pay  gap  within 
Agincare, where the company employs 
over  250  people. The  gender  pay  gap 
means  the  difference  between  the 
average  pay  of  women  and  men, 
regardless of their role. This is the first 
report  that  has  been  required  and  it 
covers a snapshot date of 5 April 2017. 
It  only  covers  Agincare  UK  Ltd  and 
Agincare  Live-in  Care  Services  Ltd,  as 
our other companies employ less than 
250  employees. These  companies  are: 
Agincare Group, Staff Now, Nurses Now 
and Training Now, along with Agincare 
Homes Holdings and all subsidiary care 
homes. However, the patterns that are 
shown  in  Agincare  UK  are  reflective 
in  head  office  and  our  other  related 
care  companies.  Agincare  Live-in  Care 
Services  shows  some  variance,  as 
explained below.

What is required by the legislation?
Employers must set out the six key metrics that are necessary under the rules on 
gender pay gap reports. These are:
• 

the difference in the mean pay of full-pay men and women, expressed as a 
percentage;
the difference in the median pay of full-pay men and women, expressed as a 
percentage;
the difference in mean bonus pay of men and women, expressed as a 
percentage;
the difference in median bonus pay of men and women, expressed as a 
percentage;
the proportion of men and women who received bonus pay; and
the proportion of full-pay men and women in each of four quartile pay 
bands.

Our figures have been reached using the mechanisms that are set out in the 
gender pay gap reporting legislation.

issue,  Agincare 

What more can we do?
We are confident that all of our related policies and 
procedures  positively  promote  gender  pay  gap 
issues;  these  are  kept  under  review  by  our  Policy 
Review Group.
As a sector in which women are strongly represented 
but  also  in  which  workforce  shortages  are  a  well-
known 
reviews  our 
workforce conditions, recruitment and retention, pay 
and  benefits,  along  with  policies  and  procedures, 
training and development support.
Agincare  Live-in  Care,  when  next  recruiting,  will 
consider any additional ways of encouraging further 
female representation at a senior level.
I can confirm that the above data prepared by Owen 
Griffiths, Chief Finance Officer and Amy Crabb, Group 
HR  Manager,  is  correct  and  has  been  produced  in 
line with the requirements of the legislation.

regularly 

“Agincare  UK  employs  a 
high number of women in 
senior positions and there 
is no pay gap between their 
pay and men’s pay in such 
positions.”

What do our figures show?
Whilst  there  is  no  legal  obligation  on  employers 
to  publish  a  narrative  explaining  their  gender  pay 
gap figures, we wanted to put these statistics into 
perspective.
•  Within  the  overall  structure  of  our  companies, 
Agincare’s figures show a high level of women 
in management and more senior positions and 
with appropriate pay; more than men.
There are some figures, like bonus percentages, 
that  are  calculated  on 
fairly  small  bonus 
payments; these include internal schemes such 
as ‘introduce a care worker’ payments.

• 

In  our  Live-in  Care  team,  there  are  more  men 
employed  in  senior  management  positions  at  this 
time, therefore the hourly rate is distorted by a few 
people in the few senior posts.
How  does  Agincare’s  gender  pay  gap  look 
against the wider picture?
Our  statistics  are  fairly  reflective  of  a  sector  in 
which women are highly representative of the total 
workforce. Agincare UK employs a high number of 
women in senior positions and there is no pay gap 
between their pay and men’s pay in such positons. 
Compared to other sectors in which gender pay gaps 
are wide, we are pleased to note that our data does 
not  show  such  gaps. There  is  no  real  comparable 
sector position at this time.
Whilst  our  Live-in  Care  company  shows  a  higher 
%  of  men  in  senior  positions,  and  therefore  with 
higher pay bands, this is not representative across 
the related companies in Agincare.

Group Chief Executive Officer
