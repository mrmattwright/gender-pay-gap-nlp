population and staff by making sure that no person is ever at a
disadvantage when it comes to their healthcare or place of
work.  Committed to providing high quality and safe care for all, the
Trust upholds a culture in which all people are valued and
respected.  As an NHS organisation, the Trust has a duty to protect all
people that use its services, such as patients, staff and
volunteers, from any form of discrimination in relation to a
personal characteristic.  The promotion of the Equality Act 2010 throughout the Trust
creates an environment in which everyone feels valued and able to
give their best.  To achieve this, we follow the principles and guidelines set out
in NHS England's EDS2 (Equality Delivery System) .  Accessible Information Standard  All NHS care providers are required to provide information
