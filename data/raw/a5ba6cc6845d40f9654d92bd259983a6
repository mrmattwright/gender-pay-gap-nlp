2017 
 
As  part  of  our  commitment  to  build  an  inclusive  and  diverse  business  we  are  committed  to  fostering  an  inclusive  environment  and  promoting  equal 
opportunities for all. The Senior Leadership team in the UK has developed a detailed action plan outlining how we will build a more inclusive culture with a key 
focus on gender balance. 
 
Under UK legislation that came into force in April 2017 we are required to publish data about our gender pay gap. Gender pay  gaps relates to differences in 
average hourly male and female pay and bonuses and does not compare the pay received by men and women, or groups of people, for doing the same or 
equivalent work, known as equal pay.

At first glance the difference in gender pay between men and women seems to be significant but overall this illustrates structural effects derived from our 
integrated business model and of the industry in which we operate rather than any pay inequality. 
 
The main drivers of this gap are as follows: 
 

  The material handling industry in which we operate is a predominantly male environment with entry levels though service and sales engineering 

routes.  

  There are more men than women in management roles. This, again reflects the experience gained in sales and service environments that are 

predominantly male. 

  Linde Creighton Ltd is a Sales and Service Centre where the majority of employees are Service Engineers.  We employ 220 Engineers all of whom 

are male. 

  The figures include sales commission where the recipients are all male and management bonuses where the majority of recipients are male. 
  The basic salary figures are net of salary sacrifice contributions for pensions and child care vouchers that affect basic pay. 
 

In 2017 bonus schemes for back office administration were amalgamated into basic salary  These roles are predominantly filled by female staff. This 
results in a lower proportion of female staff receiving a bonus.  Engineers who are all male receive a bonus. 

 
 
 

 
OUR COMMITMENT TO CLOSING THE GAP 
 
Attracting talented women into our industry is a challenge but we are committed both to equality and encouraging a diverse workforce. We have developed 
initiatives which we hope will encourage more females into the industry and initiatives to address the gaps that have been identified. 
 

 

Introduced a set of Values and Leadership Principles in a drive to change company culture and has launched a new gender neutral appraisal system 
based on these values. 

  Over recent years we have increased the number of women managers and we will continue to develop more women managers as part of the 

succession plan.. 

  Continue to recruit from a wider range of industries and we have extended the training for new sales and service staff to integrate them into the 

business more quickly. 

  Continue to monitor the differences in gender pay taking actions where appropriate. Consider initiatives to identify and remove barriers to female 

advancement. A new position of Talent Development Manager in head office has been created for the whole business to ensure its talent 
development processes are gender neutral. 

  Competency based job descriptions and competency based interviews have been introduced to promote more effective gender neutral recruitment. 
  We have reviewed our bonus structures to be gender neutral.
