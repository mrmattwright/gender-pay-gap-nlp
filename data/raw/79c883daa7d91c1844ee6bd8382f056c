We aim to provide all of our employees with opportunities to develop their careers, by ensuring that we operate an inclusive, empowered culture, underpinned by respect at all times.  The construction industry is typically male-dominated. Our analysis tells us that the under-representation of women in more senior higher paid roles is the main driver for our gender pay gap. There are no quick wins to closing the gap, however we are aiming to encourage more women into the industry, motivate them to stay with us, and support them in building their careers.  During 2017, the Board adopted a diversity policy which sets out its commitment to inclusion and equal opportunity within the Board and among all employees across the Group.
