Our values are summed up in the ‘Worldpay Way’ which defines who we are as an organisation and the way we behave: Work Smart; Be Spirited; Be Supportive. As an equal opportunities employer, we are against all kinds of discrimination – direct or indirect – when recruiting, promoting or training people. This includes age, disability, gender, gender reassignment, pregnancy, maternity, race (including colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins), sexual orientation, religion or belief, or because someone is or isn’t married, or in a civil partnership. We work hard to accommodate the specific needs of disabled colleagues and make reasonable adjustments to working environments where needed. We are committed to actively promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, using tools such as Business in the Community’s diversity benchmark to guide our progress. Our most recent rating in that survey rose from 45 to 70, above the benchmark for our sector. In the 2016 engagement survey, 89% of colleagues agreed that everybody feels welcome at Worldpay whatever their background and culture.    Colleague-led networks  Our diverse workforce reflects our global customer base. Our colleague-led global networks include Women of Worldpay (WOW) and GLOW, our LGBT network, which now have more than 400 and 250 members respectively. In 2016, we launched the Muslims of Worldpay (MoW) network which aims to create a better understanding of the Islamic culture and religion.    Supporting colleagues with families  As a family-friendly employer, we know how important it is to achieve the right work-life balance. We launched the Worldpay Family Network (WFN) in November 2016 and had 285 members by the end of the year. This colleague-led network offers the opportunity to connect and network with colleagues going through similar experiences and to access inspiring and relevant events and resources on a range of issues at convenient times. The WFN network complements our partnership with My Family Care , a national scheme through which we can offer a wealth of information and resources for colleagues with families. Worldpay subsidises six sessions of emergency back-up childcare or elder care for every colleague as well as maternity, paternity and adoption 1-1 coaching and webinars. Nearly 11% of colleagues are registered.    Embracing gender diversity  We continue to focus on gender diversity and on strengthening the pipeline of talented women in Worldpay. In 2016, Worldpay appointed a number of women into senior roles including Deanna Oppenheimer, Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Group Risk Committee; Karen Richardson, Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit, Group Risk and Nomination Committees; and Kim Crawford Goodman, CEO of Worldpay US. Worldpay is a founding member of the new FT 125 Women’s Forum, launched in October 2016, which aims to help talented women at mid-career level to progress into leadership roles. Through regular events, the forum is designed to engage participants in new thinking around topics such as digital innovation, leadership and attracting and retaining talented women. We offer all colleagues access to everywoman , an online global network and learning portal that provides resources and learning interventions from e-learning to webinars. Over 700 colleagues, both men and women, are active members. Worldpay also supported the recent everywoman Advancing Women in Tech event. Worldpay is committed to promoting the advancement of women in technology, supporting events such as the Code First: Girls conference with a keynote speaker and sponsorship. Code First: Girls is a social enterprise that aims to promote women in technology by providing free community courses at universities and companies, and it runs a number of events around the UK. In 2016, we launched a return to work programme, Refresh, aimed at men and women who have been out of work for two years or more to focus on family commitments. We are offering the opportunity to re-enter the world of work through permanent roles in our Group Technology division. Last year Worldpay took part in the Hampton-Alexander Review. Backed by the UK government, the review looks for ways to improve the representation of women below the board in the senior layers of FTSE 350 companies. At Worldpay, while we have already succeeded in increasing the proportion of senior roles filled by women, we are working hard to make further progress. *denotes graded colleagues 2016  Male % Female % Total Board & Executive Committee 12 75% 4 25% 16 Senior Leadership Team 51 81% 12 19% 63 All others 2,702 59% 1,848 41% 4,550 Total 2,765 60% 1,864 40% 4,629*  2015  Male % Female % Total Board & Executive Committee 14 93% 1 7% 15 Senior Leadership Team 56 80% 14 20% 70 All others 2,610 59% 1,807 41% 4,417 Total 2,680 60% 1,822 40% 4,502*    Gender pay  Worldpay aims to ensure that all our colleagues are treated equally in the workplace. We are committed to providing equal pay for equal work, not to satisfy a legal requirement but because this is the right thing to do as a good corporate citizen.  Read more information on our gender pay statistics for 2017    Improving engagement  We have taken part in the Best Companies engagement survey for the past three years. After achieving a One to Watch rating in 2014, we secured a 1* accreditation in the 2015 survey. In 2016, we consolidated that 1* position. Participation rates across the Group were well up on 2015, rising from 72% to 86%, 37% above the average for other similar-sized companies.
