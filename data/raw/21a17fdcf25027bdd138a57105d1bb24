Typically, our female employees are in marketing, administration and other head office or regional support roles, as opposed to working in our centres.

The most common tyre size in the  UK is 205/55R16 but there are many variations so it’s important to check your  existing tyre or to check your vehicle handbook to ensure the right tyre size  has been installed.           Tyre Width  Aspect Ratio  Rim Diameter  Speed Rating      Tyre Width  The first three digits. This displays the width of the tyre  in millimetres. A tyre marked 225 will measure 225mm across the tread from sidewall to sidewall.    Aspect Ratio  The fourth and fifth digits of the tyre code that  immediately follow the tyre width. The aspect ratio or profile height of the  tyre sidewall is expressed as a percentage of the tyre width. So an aspect  ratio of 55 for example means that  the profile height of the tyre is 55% of its width.    Rim Diameter  The next two digits represent the size of the wheel rim that  the tyre can be fitted to. It is also the diameter of the tyre from bead to  bead.  So a tyre marked 16 will fit on a 16-inch wheel rim.    Speed Rating  The speed rating of a tyre is represented by a letter of the alphabet at the end of the tyre size code and indicates the maximum speed capability of the tyre. Tyres receive a speed rating based on a series of tests which measure the tyres capability to handle a set speed for a prolonged period of time.  Select your tyre speed rating to find out the maximum speed your tyres can maintain.     Speed Rating   e.g. V  Q  R  S  T  H  V  W  Y     Max Speed      If you are unsure what speed rating you need, be sure to check your vehicle handbook. Choosing a lower speed rating than that recommended by your vehicle manufacturer could potentially invalidate your insurance.
