Since the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011 (SDR) came into force on 10 September 2011, there has been a duty for public bodies with 150 or more employees to publish information on the diversity of their workforce.  Although the SDR did not require mandatory GPG reporting, the Government Equalities Office (GEO) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) provided guidance that made it clear that employers should consider including GPG information in the data they already publish. It was evident that not all employers did this, so the government made GPG reporting mandatory by amending the SDR so that all public sector employers with more than 250 employees have to measure and publish their gender pay gaps.  This is the first year the Trust has published the gender pay gap data.   For the first year, this will be the pay period including 31 March 2017.  The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men and women.  This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings eg.  women earn 26.6% less than men.  The gender pay gap differs from equal pay.   Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.
