Under the Government’s Gender Pay Gap regulations, all UK companies with 250 or more employees need to publish their GPD statistics on an annual basis. The reason for these statistics is to understand the true extent of the differences of average hourly earnings between men and women; this is not to be confused with unequal pay which relates to male and female pay in terms of similar work or work of equal value.  The commercial vehicle sector is still a predominantly male industry, on the above date the company’s workforce was made up of 84% males and 16% females. The reason for this male dominated workforce is that past education and training opportunities have all been directed at males through HGV apprentices. With the majority of our service managers progressing from apprenticeships to senior management and through analysing the below statistics Guest Motors Ltd are confident that any identified gap is related to the gender figures rather than pay differences between males and females in similar job roles.  Gender Pay Gap Information  Pay Differences    Hourly Mean Pay Gap  23.9%   Hourly Median Pay Gap  15.6%   Mean Bonus Payment Gap  76.1%   Median Bonus Payment Gap  71.6%  Proportion of male and female employees receiving bonuses    Male Employees  69.2%    Female Employees  58.7%    Pay Percentage Distributions     Male %  Female %    Lower Quartile  85.9%  14.1%    Lower Middle Quartile  70.0%  30.0%    Upper Middle Quartile  87.3%  12.7%    Upper Quartile  91.5%  8.5%    I, Richard Barron, Financial Director, confirm that the information in this report is accurate.
