The information must be compiled annually and made available on the companyâ€™s website for at least three years from the date of publication. These requirements are outlined in The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 , which was introduced with the intention of encouraging employers to work harder to eliminate their gender pay gap.  2017  You are reading the 2017 gender pay gap report for KPPES Ltd. This is the company that employs all contractors who use our payroll and employment service, Key Portfolio. In line with the reporting guidance , the data for this report includes all â€˜ full-pay relevant employees â€˜ and is based on the pay period (e.g. the week or month) that included the governmentâ€™s â€˜snapshot dateâ€™ of 5th April 2017.  Hourly pay rates and bonuses  We calculated the mean (average) hourly rate of pay that our male employees received and compared it to that of female employees. It showed a pay gap of 6% in favour of men. When we did the same with the median (midpoint) hourly rate of pay, it showed a 3% pay gap in favour of men.  We did not pay bonuses to any employees and therefore thereâ€™s a 0% difference between bonuses paid to males and females.  Pay quartiles  We ranked all of our employees from highest to lowest paid and divided the list into four equal parts. We then compared the proportion of males and females in each pay band . The results are illustrated below:  To summarise:   Across our whole workforce , 68% are female and 32% are male.  In the upper quartile (i.e. the highest paid employees), 38% are male and 62% are female.  In the upper middle quartile, 31% are male and 69% are female.  In the lower middle quartile, 34% are male and 66% are female.  In the lower quartile (i.e. the lowest paid employees), 27% are male and 73% are female.   Statement  The information in this statement is accurate.
