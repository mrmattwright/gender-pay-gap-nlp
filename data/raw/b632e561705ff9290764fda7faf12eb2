Principles > Workforce Diversity           Home  About Us  Guiding Principles  Corporate Governance  Workforce Diversity                  Workforce Diversity    One of our greatest strengths is the diversity of our workforce, with men and women of many nationalities and backgrounds working together and sharing common objectives. Schlumberger does not have a 'nationality' which describes its culture, but operates in a truly global fashion throughout the world. As a company, we encourage fair employment practices worldwide and offer equal opportunities to all our employees. We also try to take family considerations into account in any decisions about personnel matters or assignments.  Workplace Diversity—developing human resources for the future  Our customers, suppliers and shareholders are increasingly global and diverse. They expect us to understand, respond and deliver services that meet their unique expectations.  We must attract and retain top performers worldwide from the full depth of the talent pool and address the evolving needs of our workforce in terms of quality of life and dual career expectations. By creating a variety of perspectives—gender and culture—that stimulate productive creativity and innovation—we maintain our competitive edge.  Three prerequisites upon which we will proceed with our diversity efforts:   We are a publicly traded corporation concerned with profitability and shareholder return.  Meritocracy drives our actions, decisions and employee advancement.  While it is a competitive advantage that our workforce communicates in a multitude of languages, English is the common language of our internal management communication.   Gender Diversity—a commitment to act  Our gender diversity focus began in 1994 and we have made progress since that time. Looking forward, our goal is to continually increase the percentage of women we recruit worldwide, ensure proper career development for high-performing women, and increase our organizational flexibility to accommodate a wider range of personal situations.  Nationality Diversity—leveraging the human resources of all nations  Schlumberger has been successful in attracting and developing nonwestern nationalities or nationalities from emerging countries, now integrated into all levels of the work force, including senior management.  Family and Work Life-mobility initiatives that work  Our people, men and women worldwide, are our main asset. The change in the composition of our workforce necessitates an adjustment in our attitude toward recruitment, retention and mobility of our employees.  Dual Careers—moving across functions, technologies and geographies  One of the most significant changes in our society in the last several decades has been the entry and continued presence of women in the working population. Families in marriages in which both spouses work are now the largest single group of families in the workplace.  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 60% of all marriages are dual-career marriages; these couples make up 45% of the workforce.  Because the proportion of people in dual career relationships is on the increase, this creates new challenges for the organization.
