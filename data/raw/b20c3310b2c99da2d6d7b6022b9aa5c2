   Equality and Diversity at Wakefield 

 
 
 
 
WAKEFIELD COUNCIL EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY OBJECTIVES 
 
As a Council, we recognise and value the diversity within our communities, those we 
collaborate with, and those we work with. We will seek to tackle discrimination and 
unfairness wherever we encounter it and apply our Council values of respect, integrity 
and ambition to and for all those we work for or with.  
 
We will also seek to promote good relations and inclusion between and across all our 
communities, recognise the diverse needs within our communities, partnerships and 
workforce, seek to ensure our services are shaped to reflect and meet those needs 
and act as a voice and champion to underrepresented and vulnerable communities 
within our District. 
 
Our current overarching equality objectives as a Council are: 
 
1)  To ensure services delivered by, or on behalf of, Wakefield Council are - as far as 

possible - accessible and do not discriminate. 

2)  To ensure the Council’s employees and Elected Members are supported to deliver 

accessible, non-discriminatory services.

Wakefield’s 
gender pay gap is 
relatively low 
compared to other 
public and private 
organisations.   

 
At Wakefield, the hourly rate of earnings for women 
is 4.7% lower than men (mean) and 2.4% lower in 
terms of the median. 
 
The main reason for this gap is that women are over-
represented in the lowest 25% of earners (typically 
jobs such as cleaners, pupil escorts, school crossing 
patrollers, 
administrative 
assistants).  For  example,  at  Wakefield,  175  out  of 
200 cleaners employed are female.  
 
At higher grades, the distribution of staff is broadly in 
line  with  the  overall  gender  split  of  the  Council 
workforce.

Information  on  how  Wakefield  Council’s 
gender pay gap compares to other employers 
can  be  found  on  the  government’s  Gender 
Pay Gap reporting service. 
 
 
Please note that care needs to be taken when 
making  comparisons.    For  example,  many 
local authorities have contracted out different 
elements  of  their  services  -  meaning  it  is 
difficult 
like 
comparisons.

Statutory Gender Pay Gap Reporting 
 
In addition to publishing on the Government’s Gender Pay Gap Service, organisations are also required to include specific Gender 
Pay Gap information on their own website.  For Wakefield Council, this information is shown below.   
 
The legislation requires calculations of two types of average for women and men’s pay, and to report on the difference for each type 
between women and men.  The two types of average are: 
 

•  A mean average involves adding up all the numbers and dividing the result by how many numbers were on the list; and 
•  A median average involves listing all of the numbers in numerical order.  If there are an odd number of results, the median 
average is the middle number.  If there is an even number of results, the median will be the mean of the two central numbers.

Bonus Pay at Wakefield Council 

Wakefield Council does not operate a bonus pay scheme - and therefore there is no gender pay gap in terms of bonus pay.   
 
Reducing the Gender Pay Gap 
 
The Council will continue to seek to reduce the pay gap and develop a detailed action plan that will include the following:
