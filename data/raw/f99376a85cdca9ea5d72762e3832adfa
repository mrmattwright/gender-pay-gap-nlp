Ewan Venters 
CEO

Fortnumâ€™s is a family business; we are passionate, 
ambitious and take care of our guests, customers, 
partners and each other. We are proud of our 
heritage and believe that by doing the right 
thing our legacy will remain for centuries  
to come. 
For us equality and diversity are deeply 
important. We give all our employees equal 
opportunity and always hire the best person  
for the job regardless of gender, nationality, 
ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation. 
As with all employers within the UK, with more 
than 250 employees, we have submitted our 
gender pay gap figures to the government. 
This report provides a more detailed look at 
that information across our entire business, 
identifying causes that may have attributed  
to any pay gaps and our approach to gaps  
that exist.

Measuring the  
gender pay gap

In line with the Government legislation,  
the gender pay gap shows the difference  
in average pay between women and men.  
This is different to equal pay which relates  
to the pay men and women receive for the 
same role or work. 
As of April 2017, all companies with over 
250 employees within the UK must report 
their gender pay gap, across four categories:
1.  Mean and Median gender pay gap in  

hourly pay

2.  Mean and Median bonus gender pay gap
3.  Proportion of males and females receiving  

a bonus payment

4.  Proportion of males and females in each  

pay quartile

We are a multi-channel business with  
3 physical stores and 8 hospitality outlets.   
We employ people across a range of 
disciplines which include Retail, Hospitality 
and Head Office, in roles from Chefs to 
Waiting Staff, Retail Assistants to Floor 
Managers, Buyers to Finance professionals 
and everything in-between. As of April 2017, 
Fortnum & Mason employed 646 permanent 
and fixed term employees;  
52% male and 48% female.
Throughout this report we share the data  
for all employees across these groups.

MEASURING THE GENDER PAY GAPOur gender  
pay gap

The median gender pay gap at Fortnum  
& Mason of 0.79% is significantly lower than  
the national average reported by the Office  
for National Statistics of 18.1%. This is driven 
by an even distribution of men and women 
employed across all levels and business areas  
of Fortnum & Mason. The mean gender  
pay gap is 4.32%. This figure is impacted by  
the slightly higher number of male employees  
(52% to 48% female) across the company along 
with a slightly higher proportion of Males on 
our Executive Team at the time of reporting. 
The median gender bonus pay gap of 7.68% 
is explained by 6% more males being eligible for 
bonus, and further the slightly higher number  
of males to females in our employee population. 
Finally, the mean gender bonus pay gap at 
50% was driven by more men being eligible for a 
bonus at the time with some women in senior 
positions not being eligible due to length of  
time in role.

Our 
approach

Our purpose is to deliver a sense of pleasure 
for our guests and customers in line with our 
values as a business. This is only made possible 
by hiring and developing the best person for 
each role and it is this single-minded approach 
that has been at the core of our recruitment 
agenda for many years.
Hiring the right person for the role extends 
beyond gender.  We naturally have a very 
diverse workforce, employing more than  
50 nationalities, with members of our  
team ranging from 17 to 86 years of age. 

We create equal development opportunities  
for all, and have created real opportunities  
for progression at Fortnum & Mason,  
promoting over 28% of our employees  
internally in 2017.
This is our first year reporting the gender  
pay gap. Doing so has provided us with a 
greater level of transparency about our pay, 
which we know is of great value. We will 
continue to monitor our gender pay  
throughout the year, and as appropriate  
review our approach to hiring, development  
and reward within the workplace against  
our values as a business.
