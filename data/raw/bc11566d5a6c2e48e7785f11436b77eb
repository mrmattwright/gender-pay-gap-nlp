Future Academies works with the leadership team to ensure we provide the best learning environment for pupils.  Future Academies is an exempt charity; this means it is not regulated by the Charity Commission but is instead overseen by an alternative regulator, in this case the Secretary of State for Education.  The main documents that set out how we operate are our articles of association, which sets our internal structure, and the master funding agreement, which is the legal contract with the Secretary of State under which we run our schools. In addition, there are separate supplemental funding agreements for each individual school.  We are also governed by the Academies Financial Handbook and various pieces of legislation.
