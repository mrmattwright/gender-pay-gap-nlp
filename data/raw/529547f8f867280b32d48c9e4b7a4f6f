We are committed to fairness, equality and inclusion 
throughout our Yellow Dot Team. We are working hard to 
encourage men to join our Team and be promoted 
upwards through our organisation. For our 2017 reporting 
year, 7% of out Modern Apprentices were men compared 
to none in 2016. 41% of out Tea People were men 
compared to 25% in 2016. By encouraging young men into 
Childcare at an early age and providing them with 
appropriate support, training and apprenticeships, we are 
confident that we can increase the number who stay in 
the Childcare Industry and hence increase their chances 
of promotion and increase remuneration.

Pay Quartiles 

The above image shows the gender distribution at 
Yellow Dot across four equally sized pay quartiles, each 
containing 78 Team members. In 2017 more Male Team 
have been employed in the lowest and second quartile 
than 2016 and Female Team have been promoted and 
hence moved into the third quartile. The split of male 
and female in the highest quartile has remained 
constant from 2016 to 2017. 

Our Team are predominantly Female, with the majority 
of the Male Team employed in the lower skill areas of 
Childcare. We are confident that Men and Women are 
paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our 
workforce.
