Our fundamental responsibility it to provide safe and effective products for customers and patients.  Similarly, because our business dealings are heavily regulated by laws, breaking these laws can result not only in serious fines, but also in criminal penalties for the company and us as individuals.

Unethical behavior is not tolerated.  In our interactions with health care providers, we strive to build long-term relationships with our customers. It is critical to our success. To achieve this, we establish Elekta as a trusted partner who can always be relied on to act openly and honestly.

Similarly, we honor all import and export trade requirements when transferring our products, services and technology across borders.                   Protecting our funds and assets  In matters in which there may be a conflict of interest, all Elekta employees are expected to make decisions and financial commitments that advance only the goals and objectives of the company, and not their personal interests.  Elekta’s assets cover a range of property, including information and computers, telephones, software, product plans, strategy documents and similar items. Because these items are critical to the success of our company, Elekta employees need to manage and protect them to safeguard our business and reputation.  To maintain our shareholders’ trust and fulfill our accountability with the financial market, we must record all transactions promptly, accurately, completely and honestly in accordance with applicable internal and external financial and accounting principles, standards and regulations. Financial integrity is critical.  Employees, directors and officers that have regular access to non-public information (i.e., “Insiders”) have additional obligations and must keep themselves informed and actively seek guidance from the General Counsel before any trading in Elekta shares.
