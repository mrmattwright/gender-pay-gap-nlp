However, we will explore how we can attract more women, as well as individuals from
diverse backgrounds, to management positions, in order to create a more even gender
balance throughout the organisation. We will also work on developing the progression
potential of our existing female workforce.  Champion flexibility for all – Flexible working is an important part of our culture. We will actively encourage flexible working across our organisation, to enable our people
achieve their full potential while balancing the demands of their role with commitments
outside of work.
