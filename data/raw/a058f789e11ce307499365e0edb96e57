The UK Government requires all companies with 250 or more employees to publish details of their gender pay and bonus gap from the 5 April 2017. These figures are based on a snapshot of the organisation taken at 5 April 2017.  The “gender pay gap” is the difference between the average hourly rate of pay between male employees and female employees. This is shown as a percentage of the average hourly pay of the male employees. It is important to note that gender pay is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay is about men and women receiving equal pay for carrying out the same or similar roles or ‘work of equal value’.  We have reported on both Dyson Ltd and Dyson Technology Ltd. Dyson Technology Limited primarily contains our engineering, technology and group functions, whereas Dyson Limited is the legal entity aligned to our GB market.   It is no secret that engineering is a male dominated industry. While Dyson’s figures compare favourably to the UK national average and the average reported by both the Engineering and Technology sectors, we recognise there is more to do to close the gap. Dyson proactively seeks to attract and retain more women in engineering and other roles across all levels of our organisation.  Dyson has been taking pro-active steps to encourage more women to consider STEM subjects and careers for 15 years. Since 2012, the James Dyson Foundation team and Dyson engineers have delivered lectures, workshops and events to 51,000 school children. For the first time, in 2017 the Industrial Design and Engineering course at the Dyson School at Imperial College had more women than men on it. We have also set up the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology which has 27% female undergraduates, compared to 15.1% of engineering undergraduates in the UK in 2017. We are aiming for 50% of Dyson Institute undergraduates to be female. By encouraging more women into engineering we hope they go on to have successful careers, taking up more senior, and therefore better paid roles, to help close the gender pay gap.
