A message from Garry Mackay 
CEO of Ashfords LLP

“Whilst compiling the data for this report, 
it was easy to bemoan the statutory 
reporting requirements as being too 
prescriptive and failing to allow us to 
properly explain the position. Compared 
to available market data, our figures are 
within the norm for the legal industry and 
our analysis for this report has reaffirmed 
that there is no indication of any gender 
pay differentials between lawyers of similar 
qualification and other roles across the 
business (taking into account location and 
areas of expertise). However, this is clearly 
not enough and to some degree misses the 
point. 

The primary reasons our figures show a 
gap in pay is that we have a disparity in 
the number of men in senior positions 
compared to women. Our figures, however, 
show that the number of women lawyers 
progressing through the firm outnumber 
male counterparts by a considerable 
margin. This is a positive shift in that it 
emphasises that as a firm we are recruiting 
and promoting on merit and it may be 
simply a question of time before these 
statistics are reversed. However, we 
are not going to be complacent and are 
determined to ensure that there are no 
actual or perceived barriers in place to 
limit or prohibit any gender from achieving 
seniority across all aspects of the firm.”

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THE FIRM

We have worked hard over the past two years to lay the foundations for improvements to the culture and 
values of the firm.  Our aim is to provide an inclusive and supportive working environment that:

•  Gives our people equal access to development opportunities

• 

• 

• 

Enables and empowers them to take responsibility for their career progression

Embraces a flexible and agile approach to work, with a focus on rewarding performance

Supports the effective management of work and non-work life to the benefit of both the individual and 
the business

We appreciate there is more work to do, including the need to communicate more clearly the steps we are 
taking to help our people build their careers with us, and realise opportunities.  

Over the past 10 years, the proportion of our graduate intake who are 
women is 68%.  Over those 10 years, 75% of Trainee Solicitors were 
offered jobs with the firm on qualification, with  66% being women.

HIGHLIGHTS

Over the last year, we have:

Continued 
the ongoing 
development 
of our internal 
career models and 
accompanying 
development 
programmes 
which has seen 
an increase in the 
number of women 
being promoted 
(62% of all 
promotions taking 
place in 2017).

Noted increasing 
numbers of people 
across the business 
working flexibly, 
as defined by 
hours less than the 
standard working 
week (23% of all 
employees and 
12% of Partners), 
and other people 
working in a more 
agile way.

Seen an 
increased female 
representation 
on the elected 
Management Board 
(currently 20% of 
all Board members 
are women).

Revised our legal 
career structure 
to provide clarity 
around career 
paths from 
Paralegal/Trainee 
Legal Executive 
through to Partner, 
with associated 
development 
provision.

Appointed 
a Diversity 
Champion and 
a Diversity and 
Inclusion Steering 
Group, who are 
responsible for 
introducing and 
implementing 
a Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy 
and Action Plan.

Introduced the 
new role of 
Director Legal 
Services, akin 
to Partnership 
but without 
the associated 
business 
development 
commitment, 
which is 
recognised for 
legal expertise 
and playing a 
central role in the 
management and 
operation of a 
department/team.

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017THE FIGURES IN CONTEXT

Analysis 
We are conscious and mindful of fair pay and in comparing pay levels 
across each group of partners and employees, we believe there is no 
indication of any gender pay differentials between woman and men who 
are in the same roles.

Our analysis of the detailed figures identifies the following key areas:

•  We have a high proportion of female employees at all levels, but 

women are least represented in the upper quartile (62%).

• 

• 

• 

The “mean” gender pay gap is less than 5% in each quartile until 
we reach the upper quartile, where it increases to just over 12%.

There is a gender imbalance in senior roles, with a greater 
proportion of men in this category, which has a significant influence 
on the overall gender pay gap.

The bonus scheme (which is based on a fixed percentage of salary 
determined by the profitability of the firm) means that the gender 
imbalance in senior positions directly impacts on the bonus pay gap.

“This report is a useful tool in 
furthering the discussions we 
are having within Ashfords on 
addressing the gender pay gap and 
building on our existing initiatives.   
 
I am very pleased with the progress 
we have made as a firm in recent 
years on issues of gender, diversity 
and inclusion, all of which are key 
to maintaining Ashfords as a great 
business and an excellent place for 
us all to work.”  

Ruth Murray 
Partner & Board Member

OUR FOCUS AND COMMITMENT 
TO NARROWING THE GENDER 
PAY GAP

To address the issues identified in our gender pay gap 
reporting, we will: 

•  Continue to roll out development programmes to support career 

progression across legal and business support roles, which take into 
account the needs of women and other under-represented groups at 
all levels.

•  Continue to review our promotion criteria and processes, to identify 

and remove any issues which could deter women and other under-
represented groups from applying for senior roles.

•  Roll out awareness training for our promotion teams and all people 
involved in recruitment, with a focus on avoiding unconscious bias.

• 

Focus on mentoring and development programmes for women 
returning from maternity leave, or returning to the workplace after a 
career break.

•  Review our methods of work allocation across all teams.

•  Review our bonus scheme to ensure it more effectively rewards 

performance and contribution and does not prejudice women or 
other groups.

•  Analyse pay review decisions within the context of our gender  

pay gap.

•  Continue to open up alternative routes into law through 
Apprenticeships and study support towards professional 
qualifications - for example, CILEx contributes towards greater 
diversity and opportunity for advancement (79% of employees 
currently undertaking CILEx studies at the firm are women).

•  Continue to explore ways in which we can improve social mobility 
via our existing trainee solicitor recruitment programme and other 
recruitment schemes and the schools and colleges with which we 
work in our communities.

•  Continue to review our flexible and agile working practice, to best 

support the effective management of work and non-work life to the 
benefit of both the business and our people.

•  Keep our annual performance review process under review.

•  Roll out a programme of initiatives from our new Diversity and 

Inclusion Steering Group (which will report to the Board every six 
months), including initiatives in support of reducing the gender pay 
gap and increasing the representation of women and other under-
represented groups at senior levels within the firm.  

•  Continue as a signatory to the Law Society’s Charter for Diversity  

& Inclusion.

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Ashfords LLP

Gender Pay Gap Report Addendum
Revised data to include Partners 
March 2018

On the 6th February 2018 we issued our Gender Pay report 
in accordance with The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017.   
 
As already stated, whilst we are not out of kilter with our 
industry average, we do not want to ignore the differentials 
and we have already identified a number of steps to improve 
our focus and approach.
 
One issue that is being flagged (which is probably more 
specific to the professional services sector) is that the 
legislation does not include partners in the data as they are 
not “employees”. Having considered this, we believe that 
the exclusion of partners distorts the figures and that in order 
to address the differentials, it is important that we are fully 
transparent. As such we have taken the decision to release an 
addendum that shows the impact of including our partnership 
in the figures.

We have looked at the data in two ways:
• 
• 

the impact if we include partners with the employee data;
the position when you look at the partners on their own.

Disappointingly (but perhaps not surprisingly) adding partners 
to the employee figures significantly impacts our original 
figures. The reason for this is down to the number of male 
partners compared to female partners that we currently 
have and the fact that by including partners it significantly 
impacts on the number and seniority of people appearing in 
each quartile. We are encouraged that our junior/mid lawyer 
level indicate that the imbalance is being addressed but the 
challenge and our focus going forward is to ensure that there 
is nothing in our approach (whether perceived or otherwise) 
that restricts individuals of whatever sex from entry into our 
partnership. In addition, the last 12 months have seen the 
sole promotion to the partnership being female and a number 
of female lateral partner hires, which should have a positive 
impact when we release our 2017/18 figures later this year.

Including partners in the employee data significantly 
increases the differential. This is due to the number of 
male partners versus female partners we currently have 
and the fact that it  moves some non-partners into a 
different quartile band. 

We are pleased, however, to show that there is  
minimal differential within our partnership structure.
