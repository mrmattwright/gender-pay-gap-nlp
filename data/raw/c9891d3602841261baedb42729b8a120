Our ambition is to be the tech company where women come to succeed.  Under new laws welcomed by Fujitsu, all employers in the UK with 250 more employees must now report statutory calculations showing the size of their gender pay gap.  The gender pay gap gives a snapshot of the gender balance within an organisation. It measures the difference between the average earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of their role or seniority.  Find out more on our blog: What does the gender pay gap actually mean?     It is distinct from equal pay, which is about ensuring that men and women are paid the same for carrying out work of equal value. We are confident, as a result of our regular analysis and monitoring, that we meet our equal pay obligations.  We are keenly aware that the gender pay gap in the tech sector is 25%, higher than the UK average of 18.1%. There must be a collective effort to encourage more women into the IT industry, where they can enjoy rewarding, creative and flexible careers.  This data is a valuable tool to help understand why our own business and our industry are missing out on female talent. Gender pay gap reporting is a critical step in our plans to attract, retain and develop a diverse talent population.  Our results show we have more work to do. While our gender pay gap is significantly better than the tech sector average, we do not view it as acceptable and are committed to remedying it. We have already set in motion a Gender Diversity Action Plan (306  KB) to close the gender pay gap, which forms a key plank of our wider Diversity & Inclusion Strategy.  What is Fujitsu UK&I’s Gender Pay Gap 2017?    Our mean gender pay gap is 16.7%  Our median gender pay gap is 17.9%  The overall UK median gender pay gap is 18.1%  The tech sector has a gender pay gap of 25%          Our median bonus pay gap is 23.6%  Our mean bonus pay gap is 40.8%  Proportion of men and women receiving a bonus in the past year: 91.3% men, 90.7% women  Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile:      Salary quartiles  % Female  % Male    Upper quartile (high earners)  16.8%  83.2%    Upper middle quartile  21.7%  78.3%    Lower middle quartile  29%  71%    Lower quartile (low earners)  30.8%  69.2%          “Diversity and Inclusion is an essential part of my critical thinking as we seek to build the teams that will deliver on a strong sustainable business, building on 80-years of expertise whilst adapting to a digital future.  One focus of our comprehensive D&I Strategy is our determination to improve our Gender Gap. This is only one aspect of our wider work, however in the Tech industry it is a particularly uncomfortable truth that makes the gender gap a stubborn opponent.  Our Gender Pay Gap figures have been calculated in line with the regulations set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation. The calculation methodology has been checked and approved by our lawyers. I confirm that these figures have been verified and are accurate.  There is not one single over-riding reason why the gender gap exists in Fujitsu. However, the gap is a critical issue, and not one to be shied away from tackling. It is fundamental to building our diverse talent pool. ”  ~ Duncan Tait, Corporate Executive Officer, SEVP and Head of Americas and EMEIA at Fujitsu   What do we think is the main cause for the gender pay gap in Fujitsu?  The IT sector faces a huge shared challenge to inspire more girls to study STEM subjects and develop careers into technical roles, which tend to be more highly paid. Less than 16% of IT graduates in 2016 were women.  The under-representation of women in senior management roles and in more highly paid areas, especially technical and sales roles, is the main factor causing our gender pay gap.  To remedy this, we need to attract more girls into STEM subjects, build a robust talent pipeline, celebrate our female role models, and provide stronger management support to enable women to succeed. We will continue to promote flexible working practices to enable our women to enjoy a good work-life balance while progressing their careers.  Taking action to close the gap  Our Gender Diversity Action Plan aims to make Fujitsu the place where women come to succeed and to close our gender pay gap by:   Attracting and hiring more women into our business, and especially sales roles, through inclusive bias-free recruitment practices  Enabling more women to progress to senior management levels through mentoring, sponsorship and bias-free internal mobility processes  Inspiring more girls into tech through our new Schools Engagement Strategy and our support of Modern Muse  Building an inclusive culture where all our women can be completely themselves and succeed in partnership with our Women’s Business Network  Celebrating and developing our accomplished technical women through the Ada Lovelace networking events and role model programs   Next Steps  These activities are already beginning to have some impact, and we are seeing improvements in critical areas:   The representation of women in our workforce has increased from 23% to 24%  We have increased the proportion of women in our graduate intake year on year: from 36% in 2014 to 45% in 2016 to 49% of our 2017 intake  Women are more likely to be promoted than men and make up over a third of talent programme participants and alumni  The proportion of women in technical roles had increased from 14% to 16% and the number of female Fujitsu Distinguished Engineers has doubled  Female employees are significantly more likely than male employees to tell us they have a good work-life balance and opportunities to achieve their personal career objectives   We know it will take a long-term commitment to significantly change the make-up of our workforce – and of the technology sector – and will continue to drive these efforts to make Fujitsu the place where women come to succeed.
