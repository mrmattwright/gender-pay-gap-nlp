The median hourly rate is calculated by ranking all employees from the highest paid to the lowest paid, and taking the hourly wage of the person in the middle; so the median gender pay gap is the difference between women’s median hourly wage (the middle paid woman) and men’s median hourly wage (the middle paid man).          Women’s mean hourly rate is  8.9%  lower than men’s   In other words when comparing mean hourly rates, women earn  91p  for every £1 that men earn.        Women’s median hourly rate is  16%  lower than men’s   In other words when comparing median hourly rates, women earn  84p  for every £1 that men earn.
