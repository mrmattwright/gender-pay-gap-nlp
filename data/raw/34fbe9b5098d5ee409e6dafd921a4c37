Our structure is designed to achieve this.  We are arranged in hubs to ensure, with the support of the main trust board and leaders, that local stakeholders govern the academies in the hub.  Their aim is to ensure actions are in place to secure outstanding community academy provision.  Each hub benefits from the central support services the CAT provides as well as a presence at local level to support the achievement of our goals.  This work includes support functions (for example finance and HR) led by CAT staff and focused on achieving economies of scale and quality. It also includes school improvement services and structural support that ensures excellent professional leadership and rapid school improvement.
