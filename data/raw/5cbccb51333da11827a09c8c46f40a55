It is this inclusive approach that has, and continues to, contribute to the success and sustainability of our business, but we can always do better!          A well new world: Workplace wellbeing today and tomorrow  Our ‘always on’ culture means that mental health issues in the UK have reached an all-time high. New research, conducted by Moving Ahead and sponsored by the London Securities business, Mizuho International, highlights this trend and emphasises the importance of wellbeing within the workplace.  Here at Mizuho, we strongly believe in the wellbeing of all our employees which is why we implement a wide variety of initiatives around mentoring, empowerment, inclusion and diversity. We see wellbeing spend as an investment, not a cost, and this is why we continue to strive for new ideas and initiatives to help us achieve a well-rounded work environment.

We foresee that our GPG is in line with other financial services organisations and we recognise that the underlying causes of gender imbalance across the industry, particularly in senior roles, need to be investigated and addressed.  We are acutely aware of the need for change both internally and across the sector as a whole.  Whilst we openly acknowledge there is a lot more to do, we are committed to taking action to reduce our GPG and have taken significant steps in laying a solid foundation in our planning for long term, sustainable results.  We are confident that we can rise to this challenge and create long term cultural change.

Being a founding signatory in London to the UK's HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter as well as the first Japanese owned financial institution to commit to the Charter is evidence of our commitment to see gender balance at all levels across financial services firms.  We value and respect the differences between all people and by promoting and ensuring an inclusive environment we can build on the collective, and complementary, skills, knowledge, background and networks of our people.  Valuing diversity is an integral part of our strategy for competing in the current and future marketplace, and driving business performance and success.  Creating a diverse and inclusive workplace is paramount, underpinned by our five Group values of customer focus, innovative spirit, speed, team spirit and passion.              Networks  Networks are important to all of us, and across the region we encourage our employees to develop and maintain their networks within Mizuho and outside of the Group, not only creating new relationships but strengthening existing ones. This is beneficial for us all.  In addition to a growing number of internal networks across the company, many of our colleagues are reaching out to external networks that support our diversity initiatives. Mizuho has women’s networks across the EMEA region for example, and as part of their commitment to providing support to working parents, Mizuho International have signed up to CityParents, an inclusive and award winning network for parents who work in the City and have a shared interest in work-life balance, whilst also pursuing a progressive career.               30% Club  In 2016, Mizuho International participated in the 30% Club's cross-company mentoring scheme aimed at developing our pipeline of female talent.  The 30% Club, launched in 2010, has a goal of achieving a minimum of 30% women on FTSE-100 boards by 2020. The Clubs is the largest cross-company mentoring scheme in the UK for female talent which brings together different organisations and leaders to ‘balance’ the pyramid to increase the number of women in senior leadership and board roles.  Between 2016 and 2017, Mizuho International had 50 mentors and mentees take part in the scheme and in June 2017, Mizuho International was named a runner-up for ‘Dynamic Mentoring Organisation of the Year Award’, in the 30% Club’s ‘Inspired by Mentoring’ awards.  These awards shine a spotlight on the achievements of mentors, mentees and organisations that have been part of the 2016 scheme.

OUTstanding is a professional network for LGBT+ executives and their allies. The network includes over a quarter of the FTSE 100 Index within its membership of more than 65 leading businesses.  We are pleased to be one of the first 15 members of the EMpower network; a membership initiative driving the empowerment of BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) employees. EMpower focusses on equality of opportunity, inclusive cultures and breaking down barriers to success within corporate organisations.

HM Treasury's Women in Finance Charter  Since its launch in October 2016, 122 firms employing half a million people in the UK and covering almost 50% of the financial services sector have now signed up to HM Treasury's Women in Finance Charter in the United Kingdom. Mizuho is proud to be a founding signatory to the Charter. This represents a genuine commitment by HM Treasury and signatory firms to work together to build a more balanced and fair industry that reflects the government’s aspiration to see gender balance at all levels across financial services firms.  At Mizuho, we strongly support the business case for gender equality and value diversity as an integral part of our strategy for competing in the current and future marketplace, and for driving business performance and success. Our President & Group CEO of Mizuho Financial Group (MHFG), Mr. Sato previously outlined the strategy, areas of focus and primary initiatives that MHFG will undertake to foster growth and promote the involvement of all of Mizuho’s diverse workforce in its Diversity & Inclusion Statement, which can be viewed here .

Mizuho International Women in Finance Charter targets  As one of the founding signatories to HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter, diversity and inclusion is firmly on the agenda of our Board. As such, we are pleased to report our commitment to set a target of 30% female representation in senior management roles by 30 September 2021.  Since publishing our target last year we are encouraged by our progress as the proportion of women in senior management roles has increased by 2% in the last 12 months. However, we know we have a long way to go and have an extensive list of initiatives planned and in flight to support us in continuing this upward trend. Although it will be challenging, we are confident that through promotion, retention and recruitment we will reach our 30% target by 2021.  "As Chair of the Board of Directors, I am proud to see the investment being made into promoting an inclusive environment here at Mizuho International and in playing our part in contributing positively to help drive genuine change in the financial services sector to ensure everyone is able to fulfil their potential."  David Weymouth, Chair of the Board of Directors, Mizuho International  Whilst we have appointed a senior member of our Executive Committee to lead and champion our gender diversity and inclusion programme (and to take accountability while on our journey), our commitment cascades from the Board down and ultimately we are all accountable. All of our senior executive team have the delivery of our target built into the overall assessment of their performance.  We are committed to developing our people; we have a broad learning and development agenda including tailored sessions on diversity and inclusion for everyone. Our wide range of learning opportunities available encourages our people to own their own development and to progress within our Company and we have put initiatives in place to support our target to increase the number of female senior managers, and to encourage and mentor our female talent.  As we continue our journey to be part of the drive for gender parity in financial services watch this space on our progress, or better still come and join us and be part of making it happen!              Mizuho Bank Women in Finance Charter targets  Mizuho is a proud founding member of the Women in Finance Charter.  Diversity and Inclusion is an important area of focus for the Bank, not just within EMEA but across our global business. Our goal is to focus on Diversity and Inclusion initiatives which will deliver lasting improvement making Mizuho a more diverse and inclusive working environment. In 2017, after consultation with employees through different forums, the Diversity and Awareness Forum (DnA) developed its first multi-year Diversity and Inclusion programme which focuses on three key areas:   Education and training,  Mizuho Bank policies, and  Specific programmes and initiatives that will make a lasting difference.     Our diversity ambassadors  Paul Carman, Managing Director and Head of International Acquisition Finance Department, is Mizuho’s ambassador for improving gender diversity and inclusion in the UK. Paul is a member of the London Management Committee, our key senior management committee, and has the full support of all Managing Directors and Heads of Department to lead this initiative.  Paul partners with Milan Makwana, Managing Director and EMEA Head of Human Resources and Diversity to co-head its EMEA Diversity and Inclusion Forum.  Creating a more diverse and inclusive environment, which makes a difference  This strategy was created gathering feedback from employees to determine what were the biggest issues and challenges Mizuho faces. Once these were identified we worked on prioritising the issues.  Outlined below are a number of initiatives currently in place to help us drive change and deliver against our pledge to support gender diversity.  Whilst some of our initiatives focus on changing culture and behaviours over a multi year period to ensure sustainable and positive change to create a balanced and diverse workforce; other initiatives are intended to aid Mizuho focus in the near term on improving our gender balance.  The Charter for the Bank is not simply about acquiring or developing more women but to strive to improve the work environment to ensure that all employees can fully utilise their capabilities and achieve their potential; whilst creating a sustainable approach to diversity, including gender inclusion, throughout the Bank.  The initiatives, many of which are gender neutral, all form part of our targets and include:  Education and training   Establishing a Diversity & Inclusion EMEA forum  Investing in learning and development programmes, including leadership courses and unconscious bias training on a local and global basis,  Expanding our mentoring programmes to all within Mizuho to support development, self reflection and career progression,, including reverse mentoring for senior women to aid our Managing Directors learning and understanding of the challenges our female senior leaders face, and participation in the ‘30% Club’ – a commitment by our Leadership Team that by October 2012, 30% of our senior management roles will be held by women.     Mizuho Bank policies   Improving recruitment practices to drive balanced representation on candidate lists, enhanced female participation on interview panels, better use of social media in recruiting and guidelines for our recruiting partners,  Developing policies and establishing best practice to enable a more agile workforce, such as job sharing, new flexible working including increasing part time working, home working etc.,  Communicating enhanced  maternity, paternity and parental leave policies for all London employees,  Incorporating diversity and inclusion objectives in our Managing Directors/Heads of Department’s individual Performance Plans.  This is also included as a metric in our Balanced Scorecard.     Specific programmes and initiatives that will make a lasting difference   Defining and documenting promotion criteria to encourage transparency and consistency across the region,  Succession creation and development of employee led Network groups. e Women’s network, Family Balance, Multi-faith groups, LGBT+ and allies     By extending our activities through these targeted initiatives we aim to attract, develop, retain and promote more women through to Senior Management levels at Mizuho.  We recognise that building a female pipeline is a major factor in sustainable change.  Moreover, we seek to eliminate any positive or unconscious bias in the Bank’s recruitment, retention and promotion practices.  Tracking our progress  As part of this initiative, we set ourselves two aspirational numerical challenges. They were:   To increase the number of female external new hires  joining Mizuho (at all levels), with a view to achieving our three year target outlined below in Table 1;     Table 1:     To improve female representation at Senior Management levels within five years, to achieve the target ranges outlined in Table 2 below:     Table 2:   We understand that it will take time for the positive impact of our initiatives and programmes to flow through the statistics above, however, we feel that we are making good progress at Director level and above in acquiring new talent across the business.   We have also seen an improvement at our Senior Director and Director level female representation of more than 3% over the past year.  Our goal to achieve higher female representation at senior levels remains unwavering and we are committed to achieving our three year and five year targets detailed above by 2019 and 2021, respectively. Therefore, we will continue to focus on recruiting, retaining and developing our people to ensure that we achieve our targets.  We believe targets are an important statement of intent and provide tangible goals to work towards, recognising our starting position and track our progress, whilst ensuring at all times we have the right person for the job by removing all bias.  The Bank recognises that there is gender imbalance across Financial Services including Mizuho, and is committed to addressing this issue. The ambition is to transform the organisation, create organisational change and a strong pipeline of female talent.
