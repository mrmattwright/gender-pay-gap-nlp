Governance, strategy and change  The Board places a high priority on attracting and retaining the right people as an integral part of our strategic objective of continuing to prioritise excellent client service which we believe will lead to organic growth. The Board is supported by a strong HR team who are dedicated to meeting the requirements of a growing company. This team is responsible for the integration of new staff and the development and welfare of people across the business.  Our Code of Conduct is reinforced by our Staff Handbook. This document ensures that we embed all new employees into the Dignity culture and reminds existing members of staff of the standards of behaviour and attitudes that are expected of them. The Code of Conduct is also published on our corporate website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk  We adhere to the Bribery and Corruption Act of 2010 and have policies and procedures to minimise the risk of bribery. This is also published on our corporate website and we have advised our suppliers that our Bribery Policy is available on that website.  Culture, engagement and communication  Communication, engagement and inclusion are at the heart of our culture. To achieve our business objectives we need engaged employees dedicated to our vision and values. We aim to provide an inclusive and collaborative culture that values every individual and provides the tools and opportunities to fulfil their potential and add value to the business.  Dignity has continued to publish a quarterly in-house magazine, 'Dignity Express', to enable the Company’s Directors, managers and employees to communicate objectives and client satisfaction results; explain developments in the funeral sector and to share best practice and news in a cost effective manner. 'Dignity Express' is supplemented by monthly bulletins and a number of communications specific to certain parts of the business to keep all employees informed of what is happening within the organisation.  Learning and development  Dignity’s investment in training enables our staff to provide our clients with the highest standards of service and care and to ensure that our rigorous procedures are followed in all branches. In 2016, Dignity continued to provide its staff with both relevant job training and tutoring for professional qualifications including the National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) Diploma in Funeral Directing; the London Association of Funeral Directors (LAFD) Certificate in Funeral Arranging & Administration and Membership of the British Institute of Embalming.  Personal development, planning and identification of training needs form a key part of our performance review process. We continue to provide a variety of learning and development opportunities, ranging from workshops and mentoring to online resources and internal and external training courses.  Leadership and capabilities  Our focus on leadership development has delivered enhanced capability in our talent pipeline, through a more rigorous and consistent approach to assessing and developing talent and a greater focus on development plans. We consistently challenge ourselves to have the right skills and competencies to support our growth ambitions. We believe that this is best achieved through a balance of recruiting the very best external candidates to bring fresh approaches and perspectives, whilst also developing our existing employees. We continue to focus on building new relationships with universities and opportunities for apprentice programmes while continuing to expand our internal learning offerings and other development opportunities.  Diversity and inclusion  With operations across the UK we have a diverse and engaged workforce that reflects our geographic footprint and their local knowledge. Dignity was awarded the Two Ticks Positive About Disability Symbol by Jobcentre Plus in 2014 and has continued to employ, retain and develop the abilities of disabled people. Dignity continues to be a member of Business Disability Forum, a not-for-profit organisation that encourages the fair treatment of disabled people in the workplace and their community.  Our people support our growth and ambitions  Building a strong and diverse business that attracts retains, develops, engages and inspires the right people with the right skills is central to supporting both our core purpose of delivering excellent client service and our growth ambitions.  We believe that the quality of our people is a strong enabler of business growth and we develop our employee's capabilities so that they can fulfil their potential and help us reach ours.  Attracting and retaining the best people  We want to attract and retain loyal employees who add value to what we do and recognising and rewarding performance and long service plays a key part in this.  Reward and recognition  In a competitive marketplace we recognise the importance of financially rewarding employees appropriately for the value they bring to the business.
