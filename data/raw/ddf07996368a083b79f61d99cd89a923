Call Assist Ltd Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

Introduction
We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017. This involves carrying out calculations that show the difference between the average 
earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee’s data. We are 
required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. This information below is based on data 
as at 5th April 2017. At this date Call Assist Ltd employed 48% being male and 52% being female. Our overall mean 
gender pay gap is 17.4% lower.

What is the Gender Pay Gap?
The Gender Pay Gap is an equality measure that shows the difference in 
absolute average earnings between women and men. For Gender Pay 
reporting purposes, two types of average figures are used:

•   Mean average - calculated by adding all of the pay values up and 
    dividing by the number of values in the list.
•   Median average - calculated by listing all pay values in numerical 
    order, and taking the middle number on the list (or a mean average 
    of the middle two numbers if there is an even number of values).

For each type of average, the percentage gap between women and men 
is calculated. A positive value reflects female employees having lower 
pay or bonus than male employees.

Pay Quartiles
The chart below shows the proportions of male and female employees in four quartile bands. The quartiles are 
determined by ranking all hourly pay from lowest to highest, and then dividing this into four equal number sections (or 
as close as possible to this).
