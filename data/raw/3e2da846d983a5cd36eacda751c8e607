Fletchers Solicitors 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

We believe that our success depends on putting our people at the heart of 
everything we do.  We cannot achieve that goal without valuing diversity and 
ensuring equal treatment of all our team members, both areas in which team 
members score us highly in our regular engagement surveys.  Whilst we are 
pleased that our Gender Pay Gap figures are lower than the UK averages - and 
that in the area of bonus pay, the gap is actually in favour of female team 
members â€“ we remain committed to reducing our gender pay gap overall. 

63% of our workforce is female and, as the pay quartile chart in this report 
demonstrates, women are well represented at all levels, including many middle 
and senior managers in the upper quartile.  However, there are proportionately 
fewer women in our most senior Executive and Non-Executive roles.  We have 
made progress in addressing this in recent years, and will continue to focus on it 
until we are satisfied that all individuals have the same opportunity to succeed.
