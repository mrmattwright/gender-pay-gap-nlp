 

2016 - 2017 Gender Pay Gap Data 

 

 

 
 
At Kids Allowed, we believe in equality of opportunities and are supportive of the 
requirement to report gender pay gaps. 
 
We strive to be a great place to work and this is supported by our team surveys where 97% 
of colleagues have said that they would recommend working at Kids Allowed.  More 
information on working at Kids Allowed is available in our manifesto ​here​. 
  
The majority of new colleagues that we recruit are apprentices.  Our apprentices are trained 
in our own Academy, where we deliver not just a qualification, but real career opportunities. 
For example our Director of childcare joined ten years ago as an apprentice. 
 
We are supportive of encouraging more men to work in the childcare sector and believe our 
children are best served with both male and female carers.  We have had some success 
here and now have several men in childcare roles at our centres.  Where we struggle to 
recruit men, is at the youngest ages onto our apprenticeship scheme and this is reflected in 
gender pay gap. 
 

As a business, we operate transparent pay bands. Our most senior management team of 12 
people is 83% female and both of our executive directors are female. 
 
The reported gap in bonus pay is large, so some explanation is needed here.  Our main 
bonus scheme is open to all colleagues and pays a fixed amount irrespective of seniority 
and during the year, any colleagues with six months service were paid a bonus every six 
months; the only exceptions to this were the two female executive directors, payment of their 
bonus was delayed until after year end and was therefore excluded from our figures.  In 
addition the median bonus gender pay gap for those with at least 12 months service was 
3%.
