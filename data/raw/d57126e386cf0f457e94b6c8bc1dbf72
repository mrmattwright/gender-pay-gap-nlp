Organisations have to report if they have 250 or more Relevant Employees at the snapshot date of 5 th April 2017 under the Gender Pay Gap Information Regulations 2017.  This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee data and does not compare roles directly.  Our aim is to use these results to assess:   The levels of gender pay in our workplace  The balance of male and female employees at different levels of the organisation  How effectively talent is being recruited, maximised and rewarded.   We invite you to review the attached data snapshot visual guides and the associated Gender Pay Gap narratives for Moog Controls Limited and Moog Wolverhampton Limited.  We intend to extend our GPG reporting to our other UK sites with less than 250 employees to gather a UK wide view as part of our continuous commitment to Gender Pay Gap Reporting.
