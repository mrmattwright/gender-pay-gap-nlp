Our approach to pay supports the fair treatment and reward of all employees irrespective of gender. Derbyshire County Council gender pay gap Grades vary according to the level of responsibility that jobs have. Each grade has a set pay range and employees enjoy incremental progression through the pay points for their grade. The longer period of time that an individual has been in a grade the more they earn irrespective of their gender. Our mean gender pay gap in favour of men is 13.7% and the median gender pay gap is 25.3% in favour of men. Bonus pay gap We don't pay any bonuses. Pay by quartiles: hourly pay quartiles 84% of employees in the lower pay quartile are women, as are 66% in the upper quartile. Work on eradicating the gender pay gap We're committed to fair pay irrespective of gender. We'll continue to build on actions and initiatives including: We have procedures in place to protect employees from any kind of harassment or bullying - these are taken very seriously A range of services to support our employees when they need adjustments where they work, or if they become unwell - to help them to return to work feeling supported and valued A fair pay structure Many different types of flexible working arrangements Support for parents and carers Lots of opportunities for our employees to make their views known Regular reviews of employee progress and the provision of training to help our people grow and develop Our staff can join a trade union or one of our four staff networks - networks have been set up for BME, disabled, female and LGBT staff - these networks and the trade unions regularly work with our management team to improve things at work and to promote equality and diversity     Tweet               Sub main  Working for us  Equality in employment  Gender pay gap              Address  Derbyshire County Council County Hall Matlock Derbyshire DE4 3AG       Contact   Call Derbyshire: 01629 533190  Text us: 86555  contact.centre@derbyshire.gov.uk   You can also use our contact form , or submit your complaints or praise .
