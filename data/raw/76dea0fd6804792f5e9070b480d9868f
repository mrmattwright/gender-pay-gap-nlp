Gender Pay Gap Report

April 2017

Introduction

Sugarman Group Limited is a specialist recruiter to the medical, healthcare 
and education sectors, and is reported separately to Sugarman Health & 
Wellbeing Limited, which provides Complex Care, Social Care, Nursing and 
Occupational Health and employs and pays its staff via a different company 
and payroll.

We welcome the opportunity to publish our gender pay gap report, which has 
been taken from the pay details of the 225 colleagues we paid in the pay 
period within which the 5th April 2017 fell (referred to under the relevant 
regulations as the “snapshot date”), of which 58.2% were female, and 41.8% 
were male.  Within the data reported are 70 weekly paid agency staff that 
work for our clients on pay rates set by the client or under agency supply 
agreements. Many more will be employed and paid via umbrella payroll 
companies that do not fall within the scope of our reporting requirements.

The report findings highlight a need to better understand why we are 
employing fewer females in sales roles, and more importantly, what barriers 
are preventing them from becoming top sales performers.

As part of our transition to becoming a social enterprise, we are developing 
plans on how we will create and maximise positive social impacts.  As we 
develop these strategies and integrate them into our future business plans, 
we will take into account our gender pay gap data, ensuring diversity and 
inclusion remain a key focus area for the future. 

I confirm the information and data reported within this report and submitted 
via the Government Equalities Office gender pay gap reporting service is 
accurate as of the snapshot date 5 April 2017.

Understanding our gender pay gap report

How is the gender pay gap measured?
There are four key measures:

● Mean hourly pay and bonus pay gap
● Median hourly pay and bonus pay gap
●

Proportion of males / females that received a bonus in the 12 month 
period ending on the snapshot date
Proportion of males / females in each quartile pay band

●

How is the mean hourly pay gap calculated?
The mean pay gap is expressed as a percentage and shows the difference in 
the average hourly rate of pay between male and female colleagues.  This is 
calculated by adding up the hourly rates of pay for all females, and dividing 
this by the number of females, and doing the same calculation for men. The 
percentage is then calculated by taking the average hourly rate for females 
from the average hourly rate for males, and multiplying the result by 100.

How is the median hourly pay gap calculated?
Firstly, you rank all female employees in order of their hourly pay rate (highest 
to lowest). You then find the hourly rate of pay belonging to the female that is 
in the middle of the list. If there is an odd number of female colleagues in the 
list the middle person will be easy to find e.g. if 105 females then use the 
hourly pay rate for the female ranked at number 53. If there is an even 
number of female colleagues, then you find the middle two and calculate the 
average hourly rate of the two e.g. if 110 employees, you calculate the average 
hourly rate of pay for the female colleagues ranked 55 and 56 in the list. 

The same calculation is undertaken for male colleagues, with the median 
hourly pay gap expressed as a percentage by taking the median hourly pay 
rate for females from the median hourly pay rate for males and multiplying by 
100.

How is the mean and median bonus pay gap calculated?
The same as the mean and median hourly pay gaps (see above), but instead 
looking at the differences in the mean and median values in relation to the 
amount  of bonus paid in the 12 month period ending on the snapshot date to 
male and female colleagues. 

Understanding our gender pay gap report

What do the percentage pay gaps actually mean?

They effectively show how much more male colleagues earn in comparison to 
females in relation to average hourly rates of pay and average annual bonus 
payments, or vice versa. 

If the percentage gap is a positive number it means, on average,  our male 
colleagues have a higher rate of pay and / or level of bonus payments than 
females. If the percentage gap is shown as a negative number, it means, on 
average, our female colleagues have a higher rate of pay and / or level of 
bonus pay than their male colleagues.

Important Note

The gender pay gaps  look at comparing the pay data for all male and female 
colleagues regardless of their job role, so is not the same and should not be 
considered to show that an employer is breaching equal pay rights, which 
focus on ensuring male and female colleagues receive the same rate of pay for 
doing the same or broadly similar job role.

What are the quartile pay bands?
This is calculated by ranking all colleagues, regardless of their gender, from 
the colleague(s) with the highest hourly pay rate in the organisation to the 
colleague(s) with the lowest hourly pay rate.  

This list is then divided into four quarters, with as equal number of employees 
in each quartile as possible. 

The report then shows the proportion of males and females in each of the 
following pay quartiles:

● Upper 
● Upper middle
●
Lower middle
●
Lower

Our results for 2017

As a sales-led business, the Sugarman 
Group operates commission-based 
remuneration schemes, which reward 
male and female sales staff equally 
based upon the sales / margin they 
generate.  
A greater proportion of males work in 
senior management and sales-based 
roles, whereas more females are 
employed within administrative / 
support roles, which has impacted the 
gender pay gaps identified within this 
report, however the largest contributory 
factor was that 14 of the top performing 
consultants were male, with three 
earning over £100k in bonuses within 
the relevant period. We need to better 
analyse and understand why we employ 
fewer females in sales roles, and why 
those that are perform less well than 
their male colleagues.
