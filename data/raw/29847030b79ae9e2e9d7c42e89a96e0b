Gender Pay Gap  Logicalis UK believes that our people are the source of our competitive advantage. This belief is so important to us we made it a part of our strategy. New UK legislation requires that all companies with over 250 employees, such as ourselves publish the difference between the average hourly earnings of the women and men within their organisation, in the form of an annual snapshot which updated on the same day each year. For 2017 our Gender Pay Gap mean was 24.8% and our median was 36.5%.  Environment  As a responsible international provider of ICT solutions, Logicalis seeks to measure and minimise the way in which any of its commercial activities may impact the environment. Logicalis is also committed to providing practical advice and support to its customers and suppliers to help them along the path to ever cleaner and greener ICT solutions.
