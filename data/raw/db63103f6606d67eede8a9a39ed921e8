 

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

It is important to firstly distinguish the difference between the gender pay gap and equal pay.  Equal 
pay concerns the pay of male and female employees who carry out the same roles, or work of equal 
value.  At Hill Biscuits, employees are paid equally for the same or similar jobs regardless of gender.  
The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the average pay for all female 
employees and the average pay for all male employees.

Various factors have influenced the gender pay gap at Hill Biscuits, with 94% of employees being 
factory based, and 73% of these employees are female.  These colleagues are predominantly paid an 
hourly rate, many of whom choose to work part time. As set out below, 97% of the lower quartile of 
employees are female, due to the fact that this quartile is made up of production operatives working 
part time, which traditionally attracts more female than male applicants.  Conversely, 73% of the 
management team and all of the engineering team are male.  Until the snapshot date of 5 April 
2017, there have been no female applicants for engineering roles at Hill Biscuits.

As part of the Gender Pay Gap reporting process, employers have been asked to split their workforce 
into four groups based on pay, and to show the proportion of male and female employees in each 
quartile

The proportion of male and female employees receiving bonuses were: Male 15.6%, Female 6.1%. 

Having looked at our results in detail we have identified that the majority of our gap is as the result 
of having more men than women in senior management positions in the upper quartile. 

We consider gender pay gap reporting to be a useful resource in highlighting why the gap exists, and 
will endeavour to take steps to reduce it.  We remain committed to treating all employees fairly. 

This report is based on data as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.  I confirm that this data is 
accurate.
