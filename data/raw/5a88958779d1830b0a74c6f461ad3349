Gender Pay Gap Report 

 

 

As an employer with over 250 employees, Mulalley and Co Limited is required to report its Gender Pay Gap 
information as at 5 April 2017. 

The gender pay gap refers to the differences in the average pay rate between men and women. This is different 
from ‘equal pay’, which under the law means men and women must receive equal pay to carry out the same 
or broadly similar work.
