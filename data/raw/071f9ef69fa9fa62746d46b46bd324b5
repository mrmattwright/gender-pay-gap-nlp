This includes the process of supplier engagement, advertising, supplier selection and subsequent management of any contract arising.  All Trust services involve procurement. Procurement can range from engaging a contractor to maintain essential equipment through to purchasing pens and pencils for individual Service use.  Effective procurement supports the Trust's aims and objectives, helping it deliver high quality services which meet the current and future needs of local people based on value for money. The Trust has a Procurement Strategy which sets out the procurement aims and objectives for the Trust until 31 March 2018.  Procurement in the Public Sector is subject to the Law of Scotland and the way in which the Trust purchase works, supplies and services is governed by these laws.  Procurement Law and Regulation  Public Sector Procurement in Scotland is subject to The Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015, The Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 and The Procurement (Scotland) Regulations 2016. This legislative framework governs how any public organisation in Scotland purchases works where the estimated value exceeds £2million, and supplies and services where the estimated value exceeds £50,000.  There are some differences in the relevant procurement law depending on the contract value. However, every procurement process must comply with the basic principles of transparency, openness, non-discrimination and equal treatment.  The legislative framework is supplemented by the Trust's Standing Orders on Contracts which set out the provisions which must be adhered to at all times when procuring works, supplies or services regardless of the value of the requirement.  Contract Register  The Contract Register is a record of all contracts used by the Trust where the contract value exceeds £2,500. This includes contracts awarded by the Trust and contracts used by the Trust but awarded by other bodies e.g. Scotland Excel and Procurement Scotland.  The Contracts Register highlights the contracted / preferred suppliers to be used when sourcing works, supplies and services.  Anyone wishing to supply South Lanarkshire Leisure and Culture should register on Public Contracts Scotland . Registration is free and only takes a few minutes to complete.
