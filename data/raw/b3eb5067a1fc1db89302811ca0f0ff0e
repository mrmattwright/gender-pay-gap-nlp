Claranet Gender Pay Gap       Due to new legislation, an organisation with 250 or more employees must publish an annual Gender Pay Gap report to reveal the average pay of male and female staff and the gender balance across the organisation.  This year’s report for Claranet shows a mean gender pay gap in hourly pay of 18%. In our view, one of the main reasons for this gap is because historically there have been more men working in technical and sales roles at Claranet compared to women.  This is an area we intend to focus on and recent hiring, for example, means that three out of seven of our Senior Management Team are now female.  We are continuously working on improving opportunities with our staff through family friendly working initiatives, work-life balance improvements, and flexible working practices.  We have a robust recruitment process with an inclusive approach allowing for smarter more efficient hiring. In addition, management training programmes will continue to help develop and retain females within the business. We are also offering apprenticeship programmes to support and train women in technical roles. We are confident that by continuing to encourage women into more technical and senior roles we will close the gap.  Claranet Gender Pay Gap report                  Questions?
