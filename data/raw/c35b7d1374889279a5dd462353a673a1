St Thomas More School is a co-educational Catholic Academy which provides for the education needs of 11-18 year old pupils from the west of Gateshead L.A.   Our school aims to provide a stimulating and encouraging environment within which students can attain the highest standards of which they are capable, and to assist them in taking their place in the world outside school in a useful and fulfilling career, with a firm sense of Christian commitment.  In January 2014 the school founded a multi academy trust, the St Thomas More Partnership of schools at the request of a primary feeder school. The trust now comprises St Thomas More Catholic School,  Sacred Heart RC Primary School Byermoor and St Matthews Prudhoe.  St Thomas More School has developed over the past 25 years into a large, highly successful comprehensive school with extremely good examination results at every level, an intake of 235 and a long waiting list of parents seeking admission for their children.
