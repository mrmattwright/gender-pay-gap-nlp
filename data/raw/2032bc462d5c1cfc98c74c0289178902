Male    Female    Proportion of Male/Female receiving bonus    50.0%      43.2%        Proportion of males/females in each quartile pay band    Male    Female    Upper Quartile    33.3%    66.7%    Upper Middle Quartile    44.0%    56.0%    Lower Middle Quartile    49.3%    50.7%    Lower Quartile    38.7%    61.3%     Overall these figures demonstrate a strong commitment by Homes Caring for Autism ( HCA ) to have fair remuneration for all our staff irrespective of their gender. The senior management team has a strong female representation which is particularly reflected in the upper quartile figures which show 66.7% of the upper quartile to be female. The progression of female staff into senior management and senior care roles within our residential care homes is also reflected in the mean and median pay gap figures which show that female staff earned 1.5% and 0.8% more on average than male staff by each of these measures respectively.  In the period under review HCA ran a bonus scheme which was open to all employees meeting certain length of service eligibility criteria. Modest bonuses were paid to staff meeting the eligibility and performance criteria. The percentage of staff meeting these criteria was slightly higher for male staff than female staff. The bonus amounts received by staff achieving each relevant performance level were equal for both male and female staff and therefore the median bonus pay gap is nil.  On 28 February 2018 Homes Caring for Autism Limited was acquired by Care Management Group Limited (CMG). Details of CMG’s gender pay reporting can found on the CMG website.  http://cmg.co.uk/about-us/about-usgender-pay-gap-2/  I confirm that our data has been calculated according to the requirements of The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Information) Regulations 2017.  Peter Kinsey CEO                    About us   Having continually expanded our growth since Homes Caring for Autism started operating in 2003, we now operate residential services across Somerset, North Somerset and Wiltshire, and further growth is on-going. The strong growth experienced is the result of Homes Caring for Autism's demonstrable ability to work successfully with people whose autism, learning disability and, in many cases, other complex needs, create high levels of anxiety, difficulties with communication and very physically and verbally challenging behaviour. Our services have a rare level of expertise in those areas and over 50% of the individuals placed with us come as a result of the breakdown of services with other providers.
