Travelodge UK Hotels Limited gender pay disclosure

Travelodge is proud of its diverse workforce. We work hard to promote diversity and inclusion across our teams, including the issue of 
gender.

Travelodge’s gender diversity is excellent and this is reflected in the minimal median pay gap of 1.2%. We have strong levels of female 
representation throughout our management structure, from the executive level through to our hotel teams, where a majority of 
managers are women.
  
The gender pay gap at Travelodge is principally driven by the representation of different genders in different categories of job, 
rather than by differing pay rates within each job level.  As an example, 48% of our employees work in housekeeping.  As these roles 
lend themselves to flexible, part-time hours, this often makes these roles highly attractive to people looking to fit work around other 
commitments.  This tends to attract many women to the job with the result that 88% of housekeepers are women.  As these jobs 
are at the lower end of our national pay scale, this affects the median pay gap.   Similarly, our bonus pay gap is driven by the current 
presence of more men than women in roles that have a greater degree of variable pay, rather than by differences between the bonus 
arrangements for men and women at each job grade.

We are committed to continuing to improve our position on gender diversity and equal pay, particularly within areas where nationally 
there continues to be an imbalance.  This will be based on robust policies to ensure that men and women can succeed equally based 
on individual merit.  Examples include advertising all roles internally to attract from a wide candidate pool, greater recruitment onto 
our Aspire management development programme from our housekeeping team and greater focus on attracting external female 
candidates at all levels.

In the years ahead, we will continue to work to make Travelodge a great place to work for all our colleagues - and to promote diversity 
and equality across the business.

Breaking the gender pay gap by quartile, we see the upper quartile is the main influencer in the company’s mean pay gap at 10.9%. 
The pay gaps in each of the remaining quartiles are negligible with instances such as the lower middle quartile pay actually favouring 
females.

Mean bonus pay difference between male                58.1%

Percentage of men and women who were          Male 8.5%

Travelodge’s median headline bonus pay gap is 8.8%, while the 
mean headline bonus pay gap is 58.1% both in favour of males. 
Proportionally, there is no significant imbalance between males 
and females receiving bonus payments. 
The bonus pay gap calculation uses actual bonus paid, without 
a conversion to an hourly rate or pro-rated figure. Some of the 
bonus pay gap is attributed to this, as at Travelodge we have a 
higher number of female part-time workers than male.

I confirm that the information reported is accurate
and meets the requirements of the Equality Act 2010
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
