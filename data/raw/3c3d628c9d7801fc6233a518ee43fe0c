Fusion now manages a diverse portfolio of facilities using our specialist expertise to provide sustainable solutions for councils and exciting products and programmes for our customers. Fusion is a national operator managing leisure facilities from Wales to London and as far north as Newcastle. No two Fusion sites are the same, we retain the heritage of centres when we refurbish and we are experienced at managing centres from ice rinks to outward bound residential centres, town halls and expansive leisure facilities. We put our energies into providing facilities and programmes that are an attractive proposition to the local community. We respect the history of our centres and it is not uncommon for generations of local residents to hold fond memories of learning to swim in our centres, playing football matches over the years and hosting birthday celebrations at our sites. Fusion is a registered charity, there are therefore no shareholders. We are able to continually reinvest in facilities, products and importantly people. Our Board of Trustees volunteer their time and guide decision making, they have a wealth of expertise and experience and a genuine interest in health and wellbeing.                            151-153 Bermondsey St   Unit 4 Bickels Yard, London Bridge , London , SE1 3HA    Facebook  Twitter  YouTube        About Fusion  Our Partners  Privacy Policy  Terms & Conditions  Disclaimer  Accessibility  F-NET  Jobs at Fusion            Leave Feedback  Join Now  Careers At Fusion       Share     Facebook  Twitter  Google +  Copy this URL http://tinyurl.com/y7mv5ezu       Back to top      Close   Search site   Search Site    Search
