Gender Pay Gap as at 31 March 2017 

 
The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 requires 
public  sector  employers  with  250  or  more  employees  on  the  snapshot  date  of  31  March 
each given year, to carry out gender pay analysis and reporting. 
 
The gender pay gap report must set out the Council’s results in relation to:

full  pay  relevant  employees  and  that  of  female  full  pay 
relevant employees

The  Council  is  required  to  publish  the  results  on  our  website  by  31  March  2018.    In 
addition, the results must also be published on a specified government website. 
 
The  Government  considers  that  the  rate  of  progress  in  terms  of  closing  the  gender  pay 
gap  is  too  slow,  and  has  committed  to  closing  the  gap  within  a  generation.    The  gender 
pay  gap  reporting  requirements  enable  employers  to  compare  the  gender  pay  gap  in  its 
own organisation, and look at ways to close the gap if an issue arises. 
 
The  data  analysed  relates  to  all  “employees”  of  the  Council  and  includes  those  under  a 
contract  of  service,  apprenticeship  or  a  contract  to  do  work  personally.    The  analysis  is 
based  on  all  individual  employees  and  not  full  time  equivalents.    The  pay  is  based  on 
ordinary  pay  which  includes  basic  pay  (hourly  rate),  occupational  pension  benefits, 
contractual enhancements and sick pay.  The hourly rate is used as it takes account of the 
fact that more men than women work full time.  It excludes expenses, overtime pay, pay in 
lieu  of  leave,  benefits  in  kind,  redundancy  pay  and  other  payments  transferable  to 
termination.  
 

 
 
Gender Pay Gap Outcomes 
 
The results of the 6 required calculations are outlined below, based on the data obtained 
for the snapshot date of 31 March 2017. 
 
The Council employed 494 eligible individuals on the snapshot date, when split into gender 
the figures are as follows:

Mean Gender Pay Gap 
 
The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male 
full pay relevant employees and that of female full pay relevant employees.

The  median  hourly  rate  of  female  employees’  is  17%  lower  than  male  employees’.    In 
accordance with the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings  – Office for National Statistics 
(ONS)  2016  the  gender  pay  gap  for  full  and  part  time  employees  was  18.1%  in  2016.  
Therefore the Council’s gender pay gap is less than this national statistic. 
 
Mean Bonus Gap 
 
The  difference  between  the  mean  bonus  pay  paid  to  male  relevant  employees  and  that 
paid to female relevant employees. 
 
The  Council  does  not  consider  that  it  pays  bonus  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  set  out 
and therefore reporting on this element is not applicable.

There  is  a  relatively  even  split  of  males  and  females  in  the  Upper  Middle  Quartile.  
However,  as  outlined  in  the  table  the  Upper  Quartile,  Lower  Middle  Quartile  and  Lower 
Quartile outline some differences.  These sections show that there are a greater proportion 
of males in the Upper Quartile.  In the Lower Middle Quartile and Lower Quartile there are 
a higher proportion of females.

In  order  to  analyse  the  quartiles  further,  an  additional  piece  of  reporting  was  conducted 
into the breakdown of full and part time staff, by gender, in each quartile as evidenced in 
the table above. 
 
All  quartiles  show  that  females  significantly  occupy  more  part  time  posts  than  male 
employees.    This  is  reflected  particularly  in  the  Lower  Middle  Quartile  and  the  Lower 
Quartile. 
 
Findings 
 
In terms of the quartiles, it should be noted that the pay grades do not fit neatly into each 
quartile.    In  order  to  establish  each  quartile,  the  total  number  of  full  pay  relevant 
employees (not the pay bands) was split into four equal parts.  Therefore, this means that 
grades  may  appear  in  more  than one  quartile.    Additionally,  enhancements  can  increase 
an individual’s position within the quartiles from a lower quartile to a higher quartile.   
 
The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  enhancements,  such  as  standby  allowance,  received  by 
some  individuals’  in  particular  posts  increase  the  average  hourly  rate.    There  are  some 
areas  of  work  that  attract  the  standby  allowance,  and  these  could  be  considered  to  be 
traditionally  male  dominated.    Therefore  the  Council  has  struggled  to  recruit  women  in 
these areas. 
 
In  comparison,  there  are  more  female  and  part  time  employees  on  the  lower  pay  scales 
and  the  posts  that  they  occupy  do  not  require  them  to  undertake  the  duties  that  some 
other posts  receive  enhancements for.   This  therefore  reflects  a  difference  in  the  gender 
pay as in some areas there are currently only male employees in those posts.   
 
Charnwood Borough Council is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal 
treatment  for  all  employees,  regardless  of  sex,  race,  religion  or  belief,  age,  marriage  or 
civil  partnership,  pregnancy/maternity,  sexual  orientation,  gender  reassignment  or 
disability.  Employees are paid equally for the same or equivalent work and alongside  its 
policies and working practices, the Council: 

 
  carries out Equal Pay Audits at regular intervals 
  evaluates posts through an agreed job evaluation process. 

 
Based  on  the  information  analysed  the  gender  pay  gap  does  not  appear  to  stem  from 
paying  men  and  women  differently  for  the  same  or  equivalent  work  in  principle.    It  is 
observed that the gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work 
within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.  However, enhancements 
have had an impact upon the results within the quartiles and these could be considered to 
have had an impact upon the results between the male and female employees.
