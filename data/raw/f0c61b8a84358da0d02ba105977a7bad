Gender Pay Gap Report

This gender pay gap report provides a snapshot of the gender pay balance within our organisation as at  
5 April 2017. It measures the difference between the average pay of all male and female employees, 
irrespective of their role or seniority, as well as the difference in bonus pay and the gender distribution  
of staff across four pay quartiles.

FUJIFILM UK Limited is committed to hiring and developing staff 
irrespective of gender or any other form of bias:

“right person, right skills, right place”

We have a proud history of developing our employees and our low 
turnover of staff and positive feedback within forums, surveys and 
events is testament to a happy, motivated and engaged team.

However, we also recognise that FUJIFILM UK Limited has a gender 
pay gap and that, as an organisation like many others, females  
are under-represented at a senior level and in our sales and  
technical areas.

The key data is presented below:

We are confident that we do not have any equal pay issues. Male and 
female employees are paid the same where they carry out equivalent 
roles. Additionally, we use internal and external benchmarking tools 
and are confident that our pay rates are appropriate for the roles 
being carried out. However, we acknowledge that there is work to 
do in balancing our representation in certain areas and we are taking 
active steps towards this goal.

We are confident that we do not have 
any equal pay issues. Male and female 
employees are paid the same where 
they carry out equivalent roles. 

With a history in providing technical and engineering products, support 
and solutions our operation has historically attracted a majority of male 
candidates – particularly in traditionally male dominated industries such 
as print.

Many of these long serving employees have progressed into senior 
roles which has exacerbated the gender imbalance at senior levels.

Low staff turnover year on year has limited the number of opportunities 
to recruit new staff into our senior, sales and technical teams.

However, we are seeing year on year growth in recruiting females 
into sales and technical roles, we are progressing females into 
management levels and over time we expect this gap to lessen.

The split of males and females in our 
customer service and administrative  
support roles shows that a significant 
proportion are female.

These support roles tend to be less senior 
and are generally in the lower quartile  
pay ranges.

The split of males and females in technical 
and sales roles illustrates that a significant 
proportion are male. 

Technical and sales roles tend to be more 
senior and therefore attract higher salaries 
and bonus potential.

As we look to build year on year growth of 
females recruited into these categories, this 
will help address our pay gap.

The very large differences between the numbers of males and 
females in these role categories significantly contributes to our 
average pay and bonus gap.

However, the number of females in these categories of roles 
is increasing. 

Over the last 3 years: 

47% of our hires into sales roles were female

18% of our hires into technical roles were female

49% of all our hires were female

Splitting our workforce into quartiles we can see there is work to do in increasing the proportion of females in our upper and upper middle quartiles.

These distinctions are evident in our report and whilst recognising the fantastic contribution that all of our teams make to the success of our 
business we must acknowledge that in senior, technical and sales positions we need to work towards a better balance between male and 
female appointments.

Bonus pay
The vast majority of our workforce receive a bonus.

Our bonus payments illustrate a differential as we have a higher proportion of males currently in sales, technical and senior management 
positions, which provide for greater incentive opportunities and payments, being based on individual performance measures or commission, 
rather than broad organisational metrics used for many of our support roles.

Additionally, unlike the calculations in regard to basic pay, the bonus calculations are the actual sums paid. These figures therefore reflect any 
pro-rating as a result of part time working. We have a majority of part time workers who are female and the pro-rated bonuses for these staff 
contribute to the differential in bonus pay.

The future
We are committed to achieving year on year improvements in the gender balance of our sales, technical and senior management roles  
and we are confident that in doing so our gender pay gap will reduce.

Action being taken to close the gap:

•   Attracting and hiring more females into our business, especially in sales and technical roles – almost 40% of new hires in these roles were 

females in 2017; and this figure has been steadily increasing over the past 3 years.

•  Supporting more women to progress into senior management levels through succession planning and leadership & management training.

•   Developing routes to attract female STEM graduates and professionals.

These developments will not happen in isolation and we must ensure a broader balance over time as we look to develop our business,

I confirm that the details included in this report are accurate.
