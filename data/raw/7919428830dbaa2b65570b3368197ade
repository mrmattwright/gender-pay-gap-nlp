The gender pay gap is the difference (in percentages) between the average pay for men and women in the same company. Average pay is calculated by dividing the total pay bill for each gender by the number of employees of each gender. A positive percentage means that men earn more than women, a negative percentage means that women earn more than men. All companies with more than 250 employees are required to publish these figures to promote equality of pay between women and men. Total Community Care Ltd (TCC) is committed to this principle.  What’s the bigger picture?  The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings: 2017 provisional and 2016 revised results (across all industries) showed a gender pay gap for full timers of 18.1%.  The average gender pay gap for hourly paid staff in our sector, health and social care, stood at 5.4%.  This means that, on average, men earned 5.4% more than women. (People Management analysis, February 2018).  What’s the picture in TCC?  Most TCC staff are paid hourly and our gender pay gap (using April 2017 data) was 2.26%, so, on average, men earned 2.26% more than women. This showed that there is no significant difference between men’s and women’s pay in TCC.  What are “Pay Quartiles”?  Another way to check that women are evenly represented through a company’s pay levels is by dividing the company’s pay range (from the lowest pay level to the highest) into four equal parts – these parts are called “quartiles” ranging from the Upper Quartile (the highest-paid 25%), Upper Middle, Lower Middle and Lower (the lowest-paid 25%).  How Even is Women’s Pay?  An average of 77.8% of health and social sector employees in the lower pay quartile were women. 75.5% were in the lower middle, 75.3% in the upper middle and 72.8 % in the upper quartile.  This is quite an even spread of women through the pay levels, compared to some other sectors.  (People Management analysis, February 2018).  What’s the picture in TCC?  In April 2017, 82.45% of TCC employees in the Lower pay level were women, 89.47% were in the Lower Middle, 70.20% in the Upper Middle and 87.72% in the Upper level.  This shows that women were evenly represented in TCC’s pay levels, with an increase in the Upper Level quartile.  What does this all mean?  This means that there isn’t a significant difference between men’s and women’s pay in TCC.  TCC will continue to monitor pay and take corrective action to ensure that women remain evenly represented across our pay levels.  TCC is proud of all our male and female employees.
