In line with new government regulations, we have now released details of our gender pay gap, as required of all UK companies with 250 or more employees.                                “Engineering as a whole has a huge opportunity to encourage a greater number of women into STEM careers. We already have a diversity plan in place and are committed to developing and retaining our valued female staff. We’re also reviewing our approach to recruitment, promotions, development and flexible working at all levels to ensure that we continue to maximise the career opportunities available for women. We’re dedicated to playing our part in bringing greater diversity to engineering and hope that this upward trend will continue over the coming years.”  Craig Huntbatch, UK Resident Director, Royal HaskoningDHV       The gender pay gap is an issue faced by companies across the UK and across a huge variety of industries; the national median pay gap currently stands at 18.4% (Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2017 (Provisional), ONS).  It’s no secret that there is significant under-representation of women within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers in the UK. In 2017, women made up just 11 per cent of the UK’s engineering workforce (Women in STEM workforce, WISE Campaign, 2017).  Here at Royal HaskoningDHV we are working hard to address this imbalance – and our figures show that we are moving in the right direction. Currently, 31% of our UK workforce is female.         “I joined Royal HaskoningDHV 9 years ago as a Principal Engineer and today I’m Director of the Project Management Consultancy Advisory Group. I can truly say that Royal HaskoningDHV invests in its people – I’m very fortunate to have had some amazing opportunities throughout my career and I’m determined to provide the same for my team. I’m a firm believer in encouraging diversity in our industry and I work hard to encourage my female colleagues. Within my team of 19, I’m very proud to say that 7 of those are women.”  Melissa Hipwell, Advisory Group Director, Royal HaskoningDHV            Addressing the Gender Pay Gap  We recognise that the most diverse teams are the highest performing and have actively sought to increase diversity for many years.  We will progress many initiatives in 2018 to attract and develop more women within Royal HaskoningDHV, including:   Ensuring recruitment campaigns have the right qualities to inspire women  Encouraging more women to progress their careers and mentor others  Supporting our managers to embed diversity within their succession planning  Driving greater flexibility for those returning from parental leave  Providing unconscious bias training for all managers  Working with primary schools to challenge preconceptions about gender-specific jobs   We recognise that it will take many years to achieve a true gender balance within our industry, but we are committed to ensuring the success of these initiatives.  We are confident that as women continue to join and progress within the company, our gender pay gap will start to reduce.  “I confirm that the data reported is accurate and that it meets the requirements of the regulations.”         Craig Huntbatch, UK Resident Director, Royal HaskoningDHV                 Aimee McRoyall   Regional HR Manager, UK       +44 (0) 1733 336571    aimee.mcroyall@rhdhv.com     Send message    Send message                                                         © HaskoningDHV UK Ltd. 2018   Feedback & Disclaimer    Legal & Privacy    Contact
