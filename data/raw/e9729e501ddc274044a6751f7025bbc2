Gender Pay Gap 
Report 2017

Introduction

A message from Will Davies,  
Director of HR 

Our goal is to make Ordnance Survey a great place to work and 
a key pillar of this is harnessing the talents of our people and 
creating the environment to enable a diverse and inclusive culture 
to flourish.  

Our gender pay gap is 7.7%, which is significantly lower than the 
UK average of 18%. I know there is more we can do to reduce the 
gender pay gap. We’ve made some good progress recruiting senior 
females over the past year, which will help us address the gender 
gap. Importantly, our focus for the coming year is developing our 
internal talent to ensure everyone can fulfil their potential and 
progress through their career.

We’re proud of our role as the national mapping agency for 
Great Britain, and a world-leading geospatial organisation. 
Ordnance Survey data and expertise supports services 
in almost every sector and most famously helps people 
explore the great outdoors with our iconic map products. 
We have built a reputation for precision, accuracy and detail 
because of the passion and energy our people bring to their 
role each day.

ORDNANCE SURVEYWhat is the Gender 
Pay Gap?

The gender pay gap measures the difference in pay between 
men and women, irrespective of the type of work they do, 
across an entire organisation, business sector, industry or 
economy. 

The same mean and median calculations are required 
for bonuses and the proportion of women and men 
receiving a bonus payment over the same period must 
also be reported. 

The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay is 
the pay difference between men and women who carry out 
the same or similar role. It is unlawful to pay men more than 
women doing the same or similar role. 

To work out the 7.7% gender pay gap at Ordnance Survey, we 
analysed the pay of 1109 employees across all types of roles 
and rates of pay to calculate our mean and median gender pay 
averages. We did this using the Government’s Gender Pay Gap 
Reporting Regulations.

Calculating the Gender Pay Gap

There are a number of  calculations we are required to publish 
under the Gender Pay Gap Reporting Regulations: 

Pay quartiles should be considered in the context of our 
overall male to female split within the organisation. 
overall male to female split within the organisation. 

•  The mean gender pay gap figures, which compare the 

average hourly earnings of men and women

•  The median gender pay gap figures, which compare the 

hourly earnings of men and women at the mid-point 
when all the hourly rates are listed from lowest to highest

•  The mean and median gender pay gap for bonuses

•  The proportion of men and women who receive a bonus

We listed the rates of pay for each employee from lowest 
paid to highest paid and split them into four equal-
sized groups, known as a quartile. We then calculate the 
percentage of men and women in each quartile to arrive at 
our calculations.

Ordnance Survey’s mean gender pay gap is 7.7% and median 
gender pay gap is 6.3% - both fi gures are signifi cantly below the 
national average. 

Overall, there is almost a 7% diff erence between the number of 
male employees receiving a bonus and the number of female 
employees receiving a bonus.

This is due to the number of people who were eligible to receive 
a bonus on the 31 March 2017.  We pay bonus annually in June 
therefore the diff erence is largely attributed to employees joining 
aft er the bonus eligibility cut-off  date.

Our mean bonus fi gure is higher than other similar sized 
organisations due to:

•  the number of directors receiving higher bonuses in 
which there were no women at the time the data was 
analysed; and

 
•  most employees who earn sales commission are 

male.

Director Statement

Useful resources

I am encouraged our mean gender pay gap at 7.7 % has reduced 
by almost four per cent from the previous year. We will be 
restless in our eff orts to reduce the gap further, and we’ll do this 
by listening to our people and ensuring greater inclusion and 
progression for all.

As Chief Executive, I, Nigel Cliff ord, confi rm the data reported 
is accurate.
