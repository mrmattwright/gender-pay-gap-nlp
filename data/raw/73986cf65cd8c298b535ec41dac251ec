The calculations below align to these new requirements and reports to the year ending 5 April 2017. The causes of a gender pay gap can be due to a complex and shifting mix of factors including work, training, education, society and family. According to the Office of National Statistics, the overall UK gender pay gap is currently 18.4%. Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay. Equal pay refers to men and women receiving equal pay for equal work.  At Ancaster Group we are absolutely committed to provide all of our employees with equal opportunities to succeed, regardless of gender, race or background. With our company’s roots firmly in automotive retail and service engineering, it is perhaps unsurprising that there are more men than women in the business. Our gender pay gap is largely attributed to the fact that more male colleagues are working in more senior roles, which are higher paid, when compared to female colleagues. This is especially so in vehicle maintenance engineering where our technicians / mechanics are predominantly male. Where male and female colleagues work in similar roles, doing the same work, we ensure the pay rates are equal. It is important that our employees are rewarded for the success of our business. Our bonus pay gap detailed below is driven by a higher proportion of men in senior roles, which typically attract higher bonus opportunities.  All the information below highlights that we need to do more to support and encourage a higher number of women into senior roles.  Our pay gap results  The gender pay gap measures the difference between men and women’s average earnings and is expressed as a percentage of men’s pay:   mean gender pay gap	40.7%  median gender pay gap 30.4%   The mean figure is the difference between the average of men’s and women’s pay. The average being the total of all male hourly rates divided by the number of male employees, and the same for females. The median is the middle value, or the mid-point of hourly rates when listed in gender order. The advantage of looking at the median is it’s less affected by the numbers at the top end of the pay spectrum, like the earnings of a small number of senior male or female executives.  The bonus gender pay gap measures the percentage of employees who receive a bonus, and the percentage difference in bonus value between men and women:   percentage of employees receiving a bonus – male 82.3% and female 45.2%  Mean bonus gender pay gap 43.9%  median bonus gender pay gap 43.7%   Overall Pay Distribution - we rank all employees in order of their hourly pay rate then divide the total into four equal parts, so each part has the same number of employees. Each portion shows the number of men and women in it, with the lower quartile having the lowest paid colleagues and the upper quartile having the highest paid colleagues:      Low Quartile  Middle Low Quartile  Middle Upper Quartile  Upper Quartile    Male  56.5%  65.2%  85.3%  89.9%    Female  43.5%  34.8%  14.7%  10.1%    I confirm that our data has been calculated according to the requirements of The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
