This involves carrying out calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women within our company. SBE welcomes this progress towards bridging the UK’s Gender Pay Gap and below are our results and actions we will be taking to reduce our Gender Pay Gap.  There is work to be done to decrease our Gender Pay Gap but we are pleased to say our Gender Pay Gap is 8.02%. This is much less than the UK Average Gender Pay Gap of 18.1% and the National Technology Sector average of 19%. Nevertheless our Gender Pay Gap is still significant and we will continue to work to decrease this over time by addressing factors that we believe are causing the Gender Pay imbalance in our Organisation.  Background  In April 2017 SBE had 438 relevant full-pay employees; 178 female and 260 male. 81% of our employees (61% male, 39% female) work in our production settings on morning and afternoon shifts repairing, on average, 1.1 million electronic devices per year. In our office functions we have 54% male and 46% female employees and in our senior roles we have 54% male and 46% female employees. Our gender balance is uneven and because we have a low staff turnover (1% per month) it takes time to address this. Our average length of service in April 2017 per employee was 7.22 years.  Our Results      Mean  Median      Hourly Rate Gender Pay Gap  8.02%  3.77%     Our Mean hourly rate Gender Pay Gap is high because we employ more men across the majority of our departments. Other factors influence this such as, length of service and promoting from within the organisation rather than recruiting from outside of SBE. This means we have more male employees in higher paid roles across the organisation. We also have more men working shifts that receive a shift allowance, which increases the hourly rate for those working on certain shifts. External influences such as the technology and telecoms sectors being predominately a male environment also contributes to our Gender imbalance and in turn our Gender Pay Gap.  Our Median hourly rate Gender Pay Gap of 3.77% shows us that we have many employees working in the same or similar roles and that the rates of pay of these employees fall within a very small range that we are looking to keep reducing.     Pay Quartiles  Male  Female      Upper Quartile  64%  36%    Upper Middle Quartile  68%  32%    Lower Middle Quartile  59%  41%    Lower Quartile  46%  54%     For our pay quartile data, we have ordered our employees from highest to lowest paid and created quartiles with equal numbers of employees in each. We can see that there are more men in higher paid positions than there are women across the top 3 pay quartiles. The percentage of women in the lower quartile is higher due to factors such as flexible working.      Mean  Median      Gender Pay Gap Bonus  27.93%  3.70%      Our mean Gender Pay Gap bonus data shows us that, out of all of our employees that were eligible to receive a bonus in April 2017, the majority were male employees. Our median bonus percentage of 3.7% demonstrates that out of the employees that were eligible for a bonus, the employees were rewarded equally. Overall the percentage of males and females that received a bonus was the same although this is proportional to the number of males and females we employ.  Identified factors: Industry Type & Internal Career Progression  The nature of our business predominantly attracts men who are driven to build their careers within the electronics industry, starting from base level technicians and progressing their way up into more senior roles. This is also reflected in the composition of our highest paid positions, being filled by staff who have progressed thanks to our internal career development opportunities and who tend to hold these positions for years onwards.  We encourage personal development through various training options available to all staff, however, the figures calculated for this report show that we clearly need to tailor our current actions in order to attract more female candidates.  Actions  Some differences in where our men and women work do come down to different choices, but we need to continue building an environment where all employees have access to the same opportunities. Listed below are the actions that SBE are committing to, to improve our Gender Pay Gap:   Recruitment – ensuring that we continue to use fair and bias-free processes so that we select the right person for the job;  Development opportunities – reviewing strategies to encourage and motivate more employees to participate in training and increase interest in career progression prospects;  Family policies – updating current policies to ensure there are no barriers that employees with families can face in progressing their careers;   I can confirm this data is accurate and in line with mandatory requirements.
