Our pay structures provide all colleagues who are doing the same job with an equal opportunity to earn in line with their performance. The Company does not have an equal pay issue. The Gender Pay Gap numbers we have published comply entirely with the Governmentâ€™s requirements but cannot tell the whole story on why a Gender Pap Gap exists in the sector. The sector has historically been male dominated, especially in sales and management positions, and this drives the Gender Pay Gap. Over recent years we have made good strides towards a more gender balanced workforce. Over time this will be reflected in the Gender Pay Gap numbers that the Company will publish.
