To do this, it is vital that our employees are rewarded fairly for the role they play in the business regardless of their gender.  Our mean (average) gender pay gap is 6.3% and our median (middle) gender pay gap is 4.7%. Whilst this is less than the current national median average of 18.1%, we will continue to review our reward offering to ensure we become an increasingly inclusive and gender diverse business.  Gender Pay and Bonus Gap     Difference Between Men and women  Mean (average)  Median (middle)    Gender Pay Gap  6.3%  4.7%    Gender Bonus Gap  57%  72%      Proportion of employees receiving a bonus   Currently roles which provide a bonus are mainly populated by males and those which do not provide bonuses are mainly populated by females, creating the wider gap in bonuses. This is common in the automotive sector where commissions are paid (which are included in the definition of bonus). Most sales advisers and workshop technicians (both commission-based roles) are male and most support staff (non-commission-based roles) are female and this structure is typical in the automotive sector.   The data shows that our Gender Pay Gap is not a pay issue but down to the types or roles populated by males and females and the structure of the related reward offering.  Pay Band Quartiles      What we are doing to make a difference  We have a commitment to become an increasingly gender diverse business and our planned initiatives for revised role definition and reward offering will help the business attract candidates from other sectors.  We will also:  − Actively engage with key forums, the wider community and education bodies to promote and encourage more females into the automotive profession − Examine labour flows and female progression within the business − Review the Diversity and Inclusion culture across the business and identify potential opportunities and obstacles  JAMES BREARLEY Chief Executive Officer, Inchcape UK  LOUISE MANZANO Human Resources Director, Inchcape UK   Download our gender pay gap statement as a PDF                Cookie Policy    Privacy Policy    Sitemap    Terms & Conditions    Modern Slavery    Gender Pay Gap Report           © 2018 Inchcape Group - All rights reserved  Inchcape Retail includes the following companies, all of which have the VAT Registration No. GB243611193, are Registered in England & Wales and have their Registered Office at First Floor, Unit 3140 Park Square, Solihull Parkway, Birmingham Business Park,  Birmingham, B37 7YN :- Inchcape Retail Limited (Co.No. 194561) is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
