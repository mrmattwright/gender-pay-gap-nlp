For example, there may be a few differences of approach between primary and secondary academies and each academy's accessibility policy will partly reflect its individual buildings.  There is nonetheless a strong expectation by the directors of The Williamson Trust that each policy will be thoroughly and conscientiously implemented, in order to provide children and parents with clear expectations and to maximise the educational and other benefits from each policy. Monitoring this implementation and checking the continuing relevance of policies is the responsibility of the local governing bodies.
