For us, that means producing products in the most responsible way, thinking about the impact on the environment across all our activities, and treating people as fairly as we possibly can.  All organisations have this responsibility and to this end, we've laid our aims and achievements.  We're not perfect - but we'll always work to improve and be the best we can.     FUNDRAISING  We've raised thousands of pounds for numerous charities - from national charities such as the Fisherman's Mission and Marie Curie, to smaller projects benefiting local causes.
