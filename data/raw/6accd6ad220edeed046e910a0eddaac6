GENDER  
PAY GAP 
REPORT 2017

Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

Executive summary
Our purpose is to help Britain prosper. As one of the UK’s largest 
employers, we recognise that supporting gender equality and 
diversity more broadly will help the success of the UK as a whole. 

Lloyds Banking Group has been recognised as a company that 
promotes inclusion and was the first FTSE 100 employer to make 
a public commitment to increase the proportion of women in 
senior roles. In 2014 we set a target to have 40% of senior roles 
filled by women by 2020. We are progressing well towards that 
target with 34% of senior roles now filled by women in 2017, up 
from 29% in 2013.   

The average gender pay gap, which is the difference between the 
average amount that men and women are paid, for the Group is 
32.8%. Although this is better than the average for the financial 
services industry1, we know that there is still more work to do and 
we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
We regularly review our pay levels to ensure that men and women 
are paid equally for doing equivalent roles across the Group.

Our pay and bonus gaps are principally driven by a higher 
Gender pay gap
proportion of women in junior roles and a higher proportion of 
men in senior roles. Our bonus gap is also partly driven by the 
Difference between men and women across the Group 
fact that bonus calculations are pro-rated for colleagues who 
work part-time, an option currently taken up by more female 
colleagues than male. If the composition of our workforce was the 
same across all grades, the mean pay gap would reduce to 2.5% 
and the mean bonus gap would reduce to 4.0%.

Proportion of colleagues awarded 
a bonus for 2016
This shows that the percentage of women awarded a bonus for 
their performance in 2016 was slightly higher than the percentage 
of men. Individual performance drives the allocation of bonuses 
to every colleague. Those who do not achieve the high standards 
we expect at Lloyds Banking Group do not receive a bonus.

Glossary of terms:
Mean pay: Average pay of all employees.

Pay quartiles
The charts below show the gender distribution across four 
quartiles, each containing just under 20,000 colleagues. The 
charts highlight that there is a high proportion of women in junior 
roles and a high proportion of men in senior roles. We are taking 
actions to increase the proportion of women in senior roles.

Our commitment
Our focus is on improving the gender pay and bonus gaps by 
increasing the proportion of women in senior roles. In doing so, the 
gender gaps will reduce over time. We believe that companies with 
diverse senior management teams perform better. With this in mind, 
the Group will continue to take a lead in gender diversity.
Our progress
 • In 2014, we were the first FTSE 100 company to make a public 

commitment to increase the proportion of women in senior 
management roles. We have already increased the percentage 
of senior roles held by women from 29% in 2013 to 34% in 2017. 

 • A comprehensive plan is in place to ensure we achieve our target 

of 40% by 2020. This is reviewed on a regular basis by our Chief 
Executive and the Executive team, who also mentor and sponsor 
talented high potential women. The plan includes:

 • A recruitment process which requires all senior management 

shortlists to be diverse. 

 • A new approach to agile hiring whereby all vacancies advertised 

are required to specify how the role could be done in an agile 
way, encouraging a broader range of working patterns.

 • A ‘Returners’ programme to support colleagues on career 

breaks (many of whom are women) in returning to the workplace.

 • Agile working training delivered to every line manager and 

unconscious bias training delivered to every colleague.

 • A ‘Women in Leadership’ programme for mid-level managers 

to strengthen the female talent pipeline.

 • We were amongst the first signatories to the Women in Finance 
Charter and actively support other external initiatives to help the 
progression of women in the UK workplace. The work we are doing 
has been recognised externally:
