Student spotlight            Name:  Victoria    Course:  A Levels in Business, Economics and English Language    I came to The Henley College from Newlands Girls’ School. I really enjoy life at the College and in addition to my studies have participated in many activities, including being a Student Ambassador. Business Studies is my favourite subject. I potentially would like to start-up my own business in the future and I find the theory very helpful. I am interested in the global economy and I enjoy learning about what happens in different countries and how it effects the UK economy. My English course is helping me with essay structures, good grammar and use of terminology.    After Henley, I am planning to study Business Management at University.
