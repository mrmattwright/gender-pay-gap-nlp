The Gender Pay Gap data supplied is correct for all employees in post with Dunster House on 5 th April 2017. There were 320 employees in post. 88 females and 232 males.    We believe in a fair and ethical approach to pay. We believe men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs within our organisation and that all appointments are based on merit.    The ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings suggested an 18.1% (median) gender pay gap. Our figure of 6.37% is significantly less than this and as a Company we will strive to maintai n this.
