Employers with over 250 employees must now publish their gender pay statistics and the data reported is as at 5 th April 2017.  Nissan prides itself on providing a workplace that is diverse, inclusive and fair. We deliver award-winning school initiatives designed to encourage young people in general and women in particular to consider a career in Engineering or Manufacturing, such as our GIMME (Girls in Monozukuri, Manufacturing and Engineering) programme. We also have a range of Talent initiatives in place designed to support the development of female employees e.g. high potential development programmes, leadership & career coaching and participation in the WISE (Women in Science & Engineering) group.    This gender pay report for Nissan covers all 5 of our UK sites with a combined headcount of 8405 – Manufacturing in Sunderland, Research & Development in Cranfield, Parts Centre in Lutterworth, Design in London, Sales & Marketing in Rickmansworth.                 Although a higher proportion of female employees are eligible to receive a bonus payment compared to their male counterparts, their average bonus payment is currently lower as a result of their distribution across the bonus eligible grades.   I can confirm that the information and data reported is accurate.
