Children join our Nursery from 2+ years. The Nursery offers independent nursery school facilities with a stimulating and safe environment all set within the beautiful grounds of the Preparatory School. Our stand-alone Preparatory School accommodates children aged from 4+ to 13 years, where they are able to flourish and where they are encouraged to do their best. Our Senior School accommodates young adults up to the age of    18 – with sixth form also available. Wycliffe  is an ideal destination for pupils who want all the advantages of a contemporary environment in a beautiful rural location. Wycliffe successfully blends the best of the traditional and modern. The boarding school has excellent links to London both by road and rail and is close to the amenities offered in the Cotswolds, Cheltenham, Bristol and Bath.  At Wycliffe, we value tradition, embrace modernity and respect individuality. Wycliffe accepts pupils with a wide range of abilities and rejoices in their individual successes. Pupils are valued for who they are; diversity is celebrated.  Request a prospectus today for Wycliffe independent school or check when our next Open Day is due to take place.
