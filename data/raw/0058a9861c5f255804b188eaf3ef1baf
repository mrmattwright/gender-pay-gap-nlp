This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee data.  As Centerplate UK employs more than 250 people we are required by law to publish an annual gender pay gap report showing the difference in average female earnings compared to average male earnings.     Mean Gender Pay Gap  13.1%    Median Gender Pay Gap  3.7%    Mean bonus gender pay gap  53.4%    Median bonus gender pay gap  44.4%    Proportion of male employees who receive a bonus  6.1%    Proportion of female employees who receive a bonus  7.2%     Quartiles By Gender     Quartile  Female  Male      %  %    Upper Quartile  40.1%  59.9%    Upper Middle Quartile  54.7%  45.3%    Lower Middle Quartile  57.9%  42.1%    Lower Quartile  60.6%  39.4%     Our Statement  Centerplate UK believe in creating a balanced and diverse workforce and are pleased with the results of our Gender Pay Gap Report whilst still recognising that we have areas in which we can improve.  We are delighted that Centerplates median pay gap stands below the ONS estimated national average of 19.2%.  We have a mean gender pay gap of 13.1% and a median gender pay gap of 3.7%. Whilst this is smaller than the current national median average of 19.2% we will not be complacent and will continue to work to reduce the gap.  As can be seen from the data, collated from the snapshot at April 2017, our upper quartile shows a slightly higher number of males in these roles than females however for all of the other quartiles there are more females than males. This reflects industry trends. The reason for the disparity in the lower quartile is again industry trends with more females than males appearing to be attracted to this type of work.  7.2% of females receive a bonus or incentive compared to 6.1% of males.  This disparity is due in main to the number of females in the lower quartile where staff receive various incentives and bonus payments in this group.  ONS figures are based on a gender distribution of 53% male and 47% female against Centerplate UK’s gender distribution of 46.6% male and 53.4% female.  How we can and will make a difference  There are many opportunities to continually challenge ourselves to ensure we remain inclusive.  Centerplate UK will look to:   Commit to ensuring a diverse, gender balanced workforce which also reflects the communities we serve.  Commit to ensure that job opportunities and career progression are fully inclusive regardless of gender.  Create a mentoring programme to be delivered by our Female Leaders  Challenge ourselves to ensure a 50/50 split between males and females in the upper quartile by 2020  Review our policies, procedures and guidance to ensure that they encourage inclusive ways of working such as a reviewing our flexible working arrangements   Lisa Fisher  HR Director  April 2018                  ©2018 CENTERPLATE    T&C;  Privacy  Use of Cookies  Careers  Tax Strategy  Modern Slavery Act  Gender Pay Gap Reporting  Contact Us
