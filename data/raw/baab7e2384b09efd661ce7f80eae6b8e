So join us on a tour of our unique heritage from 1928 to the present day. Take a look below to find out what’s made Harris such a trusted and reputable company.      Our History        1928  1933  1937  1950s  1959  1961  1974  1988  1993  2003  2004  2007  2011  2013  2013  2015  2015  2016      At just 23 years old, Leslie G Harris founded The Midland Trading Company and, with a 13-strong team of staff, began manufacturing paint brushes from his small premises in Birmingham.     Having continued to thrive throughout the great depression, Leslie renamed his business LG Harris & Co Ltd.     Keen to manufacture his own handles and ferules, Leslie secured new premises in the leafy suburb of Stoke Prior, 18 miles south-west of Birmingham.     Harris launched its first national advertising campaign with a duke and duchess introducing the theme ‘Harris-tocracy’ with the message: “The paint brush with the name to its handle”.     Following completion of the new buildings, the company began operating from the Hanbury Road site where it still is today.     Harris was awarded the Royal Warrant for the supply of painting and decorating brushes to the Sandringham Estate and Windsor Castle. This prestigious award cemented our reputation for exceptional products - and we’re proud to still hold the Royal Warrant today.     Harris continued to grow and by now was fit to burst! A new 100,000 sq ft warehouse and despatch department was built to accommodate our growing team of staff and expanding range of products.     Harris recognised a gap in the market for a product that combined ‘quality with economy’. So we developed Taskmasters – still a firm favourite of all of our ranges and hugely popular in all markets.     That ‘bristle loss problem’ just wasn’t going away, so Harris developed and patented the NoLoss brand. Guaranteed against bristle loss, the range became iconic for Harris and is still hugely popular.     To ensure we could manufacture a good quality paint brush in China, Harris bought a new manufacturing facility and fitted it out with state-of-the-art machinery. It was the start of an exciting new venture in the Far East.     After extensive design, development and testing, Harris entered the professional market for the first time with the launch of T-class – a concise range of industry-leading products for expert decorators and builders.     The official opening of Harris China, located an hour and a half from the airport and deep sea port of Yantian.     Harris launched ID Gel Oval, a brand new innovative range for decorators who demand a more comfortable painting experience and precise cutting-in control.     With a shiny new brand identity, T-Class was relaunched with additional products for professional decorators all over the world.     Joining forces with one of the world’s leading construction equipment brands, we launched the first JCB decorating range under licence.     Following an extensive consumer research project, Harris was recognised as the UK’s number 1 paint brush and roller brand, with 9 out of 10 customers saying that they would recommend Harris to a friend.     The much anticipated launch of the Artisan range into the UK market. This included a number of round, angled, flat and fitch brushes, developed for exceptional control and ease of use.     Orkla House Care, a leading Nordic supplier of branded consumer goods and concept solutions, purchased LG Harris. This is the beginning of an exciting new journey for Harris, its customers and of course, its valued team of staff.                               Awards  In 1961, Harris was awarded the Royal Warrant by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, as the preferred manufacturer of decorating tools, paint brushes and rollers to the Royal Sandringham Estate. Harris still holds the Royal Warrant to this very day, demonstrating a level of product excellence suitable for a Royal household.
