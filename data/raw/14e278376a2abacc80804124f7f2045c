The data contained in this report is based on a snapshot date of 5 April 2017.  Knauf UK is committed to fair treatment and reward of our workforce irrespective of gender. Knauf UK is therefore confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work.  Instead, our gender pay gap is the result of our workforce being predominantly male, the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.
