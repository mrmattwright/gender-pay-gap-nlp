We’re proud to be a strong supporter of it – it is a fundamental part of our business strategy and is woven into the fabric of how we run our business and interact with our community.    With this in mind, we welcome the new Gender Pay Gap legislation that was introduced by the UK Government in April 2017 which shines a spotlight on this important topic and, more specifically, on gender pay. Accordingly, alongside the other SG UK legal entities, we will publish our statistics annually going forward.     The statistics published here are based on pay data as at 5 April 2017 and bonus data for the 12 months up to this date and cover ALD Automotive Limited (ALD). For statistics relating to other SG UK qualifying legal entities, Societe Generale (London Branch), Societe Generale International Limited and SG Kleinwort Hambros Bank Limited, please refer to their respective websites.
