People who are knowledgeable, passionate and committed. Frequently people spend their career with us, some because they’ve found their niche, others because of the opportunities to progress through the organisation.   We are one team, made up of people with many different roles and responsibilities – operational roles ensuring treatment works and our pipe network operate effectively; customer service roles, reading meters, dealing with customers face-to-face or by telephone; scientists testing samples and ensuring water and air quality, corporate roles in supply chain management, finance, marketing, human resources, information services, health & safety, legal services etc. All working to ensure our customers have clean, fresh, running water and that their wastewater is taken away - whilst providing great customer service, protecting the environment and supporting local communities.  If you join us we’ll create the environment to allow you to achieve your potential:      Reviewing your progress   We know how important it is to know if you are doing a good job – it’s what keeps you motivated to come to work, and helps you to do even better in your job. To help make sure you are kept on the right track, you will have at least two reviews or appraisals each year with your manager to take time out to discuss how you are doing against the requirements of the job.  But this won’t be the only time your work is looked at – your manager will meet with you regularly to talk about your progress at work and to look at the support available to you and how you would like to develop. We believe it’s vital you know what you need to achieve in your role, so your manager will set clear targets to help you meet this. And because our values are at the heart of our business, you will talk through how you are delivering these in your role – One team, customer focused, ethical, creative, results driven.  Learning and development   At Northumbrian Water, we want you to be the best you can be and we also want you to feel it’s a great place to work. We will give you the tools and support to really make a difference and we know that ongoing learning and support is key to both our success and yours. Your development is important to help you meet your own goals and ambitions. Our aim is to support a culture that values, encourages and recognises outstanding performance, and a commitment to our vision and values. You and your manager will agree a personal development plan that looks at where you are, where you want to be, and what tools you need to get there.  It is important that you also take an active role in seeking out opportunities and materials to learn and develop particular skills. We have a growing suite of e-learning tools and materials that are available to you as well as CDs / Video / DVDs, reference and work books. You can also take advantage of an interest free qualification loan if you choose to undertake a course of study which is not a requirement of your role. The course does not have to be work-related; it just needs to lead to a recognised qualification.  Diversity   We recognise that as well as being the right thing to do to ensure we recruit and employ from the widest pool of people, we really benefit as a business from employing skilled and motivated people, wherever they are from and whatever their background.  In practice this means that appointment, promotion, training and performance management decisions are based on merit, we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind and we recognise the contribution that people with different perspectives and experiences can make to the continued success of our company.  We are proud to be members of the Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion (ENEI) and the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) campaign. We are one of 55 signatories to the WISE ten-steps which aims to improve the recruitment, retention and progression of women in the science and engineering sector.
