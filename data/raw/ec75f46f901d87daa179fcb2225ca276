Apple UK Gender Pay Gap Report 
2017

We know the strength of our innovation depends on a vibrant and diverse 
workforce. From our earliest days, we’ve believed that Apple should be a 
reflection of the world around us. That’s why we’re deeply committed to 
increasing the number of women, of all races and ethnicities, who work,  
grow and thrive at Apple in dozens of professional fields and at all levels.  

We’re proud of the progress we’ve made to hire more inclusively and are 
determined to do even more to retain and promote our female employees. 
While 30 per cent of our UK employees are women, 36 per cent of our new 
employees last year were women. And 40 per cent of our leaders under the 
age of 30 are women, reflecting the fact that future generations will be 
more diverse. We’re proud that every Apple employee is eligible for 
bonuses and stock grants so they can share in the company’s success.    

Apple believes strongly that equal work deserves equal pay. Every year, we 
examine the compensation employees receive and make adjustments where 
necessary to ensure we maintain pay equity. And we have achieved this in 
every country — women at our company earn the same as men when you 
factor in similar roles, markets and performance. As part of our commitment 
to eliminating pay disparities from the first day at Apple, later this year we’ll 
also stop asking candidates about their salary history.   

This year, a new law in the UK requires us to publish the average total pay 
received by men relative to that received by women. The difference, known 
as the gender pay gap, is created by an imbalance in representation — 
specifically, a higher proportion of men in senior roles. For Apple, the mean 
pay gap in the UK is 5 per cent lower for women and the median pay gap is 2 
per cent in favour of women. 

We believe people come to Apple to do their life’s best work. It’s the 
diversity of our employees and their ideas that inspires the innovation that 
runs through everything we do. We’re determined to continue our progress 
towards a workforce that’s more representative of the world around us.  
It’s part of our commitment to leaving the world better than we found it. 

300,000 jobs and counting 
We’re proud that Apple is an engine of economic growth in the UK, responsible  
for 300,000 jobs. We directly employ more than 6,000 talented women and men 
across the country, and last year we spent nearly £2 billion with our 1,000 UK 
suppliers. Thanks to the fast-growing iOS app economy, today there are also over 
646,000 registered iOS app developers in the country — more than anywhere in 
Europe — who innovate apps enjoyed by millions of customers around the world.

Apple in the UK 
Women in the UK earn the same as their male Apple colleagues when you 
factor in similar roles, markets and performance. The gender pay gap, on 
the other hand, is driven by the representation of women in our workforce. 
The numbers below illustrate the pay gap for Apple employees across the  
UK based on hourly pay rates as of 5 April 2017 and bonuses paid, including 
stock, in the 12 months ending 5 April 2017.

Pay quartiles 
The pay quartiles show the gender distribution across four equally sized 
quartiles. The overall composition of our workforce in the UK is 70 per cent 
men and 30 per cent women.

Understanding the gap 
The representation of women in our 
workforce drives our gender pay gap.  
Thirty per cent of our employee population 
are women. There are also more men in 
leadership positions, which pay more.  
And these positions have higher bonuses 
and stock, resulting in a bonus gap greater 
than our hourly pay gap.

Putting our pay gap in context 
Apple’s median hourly pay gap in the UK  
is 2% in favour of women.  
For comparison, the median gender pay gap 
in the UK in all industries is 18%, in the IT 
industry it’s 22% and in the retail industry 
it’s 18% — in each case in favour of men.

  Our hiring and retention 
efforts are meant to reflect 
the world around us. We’re 
hiring diverse candidates for 
jobs at all levels. And we’ll 
continue to cultivate an 
environment that allows all 
employees to thrive and do 
their life’s best work.

Making progress towards greater 
representation 
Apple is a multigenerational company with employees from 18 to 85.  
As Apple continues to grow, we’re highly encouraged that our workforce 
reflects increasing diversity. 

In the past three years alone, we’ve increased the representation of women 
at Apple in the UK from 28 per cent in 2014 to 30 per cent last year.  

Diverse teams make innovation possible. Our female representation is 
steadily increasing, and we’re proud of the progress we’re making. For 
example, 33 per cent of our employees under 30 are women. That’s an 
increase of 3 percentage points since 2014. 
Growing numbers. Last year, 36 per cent of our new employees in the  
UK were women, reflecting a 4-point increase between 2016 and 2017. 

Increasing leadership. Forty per cent of our leaders under 30 are women, 
reflecting a 12-point increase over the last two years. So our future 
generation of leaders will include an even greater percentage of women.  

Hiring. We’re proud to have over 6,000 employees across the UK, so even 
small percentage point changes can affect thousands of people. 

Our programmes represent our strong commitment to increased diversity: 

• Our recruiters are attracting more and more diverse talent for jobs at all 

levels. 
• We are developing and delivering inclusive leadership training for all  
UK managers. 

• Our employee forums for women at Apple foster connection to expand 
career growth opportunities and provide support to manage work and 
family. 

• We are expanding our new Women’s Leadership programme to further 

develop even more female managers. 

• We are increasing our mentoring programmes to build cross-functional 

relationships and create new growth opportunities for women. 

• We are delivering maternity leave training for managers to better support 

female employees before and throughout their maternity leave and to 
facilitate a successful return to work. 

• We are driving succession planning to develop a robust pipeline of female 
talent through all levels of the company.

“I’m motivated by the opportunity to be self-sufficient and 
independent, and by the increasing opportunities available  
to women now. There are so many great female leaders,  
which is important to inspire future generations of women  
to be who they want to be.” 

— Carolyne Skeete, Retail Store Manager, Regent Street

Looking after employees — and their families 
Apple offers a rich and comprehensive set of benefits that support and 
reward our employees for the important contributions they make to our 
customers every day. These benefits include:  
• Bonuses and stock grants across the entire company so employees  
can share in Apple’s success.  

• Extensive healthcare programmes that include coverage for employees’ 
dependents, including same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners  
and their children. 

• Financial support for further education. 

• Comprehensive assistance for team members who are adopting a child. 
• Paid time away for new parents and for those employees taking care  
of family members in need. 
• Employee Assistance Programme for employees and family members in  
need of counselling, financial planning, legal assistance or referrals.  

“I am proud to be part of the leadership team within Apple,  
and of supporting our efforts to seek, encourage and provide 
opportunities — for both women and men — to be able to  
realise their potential, grow and develop in order to create  
their life’s best work.” 

— Souad Lassouadi, Director, Consumer Channel Development
