We are passionate about fairness and dedicated to our values: transparency, integrity, public service and impartiality. Gathering and analysing our pay for both police officers and police staff has highlighted that we do have a gender pay gap. We are committed to understanding why a gender pay gap exists, identifying any structural issues that contribute to it and developing initiatives to reduce the gap.
