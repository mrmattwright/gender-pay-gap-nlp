Introduction 
  
 
 
The introduction of gender pay gap reporting is welcomed by all here at Ebury. Over the past 7
 
years, Ebury has experienced substantial growth, both in terms of our client base and the size of
 
our exceptionally talented and driven workforce. During this period of substantial growth, we
 
 
believe that honesty, fairness, respect, diversity and gender balance has been crucial to Ebury’s
 
success. In order to maintain Ebury’s standards in this respect, we run a number of internal and
 
initiatives and programmes to ensure that honesty, fairness, respect, diversity and
external
 
gender balance remain at the very core of Ebury’s business. The data that has been produced
 
 
 
for this report will enable Ebury to continue tackling the gender pay gap. 
  
 
Ebury’s gender pay gap reports on the average hourly pay for all male and female staff who are
 
employed by Ebury Partners UK Ltd regardless of their role and seniority. Ebury are confident
 
that our approach to remunerating our staff treats all staff equally and fairly and this report is not
a report on equal pay as the report does not compare the remuneration of male and females who
 
 
 
are employed in the same or similar role.

II - Understanding Ebury’s gender pay gap 
  
Within Ebury there is strong representation of women within leadership positions but like many
 
organisations, there is a gender pay gap. In order for us to understand what factors may be
 
driving the gender pay gap, we have undertaken further detailed analysis which has shown the
 
following: 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
● The gender pay gap is predominantly driven by the distribution of males and females
across different types of roles. For example, we have a greater portion of men in front
 
office roles and in senior leadership roles which is reflective of the financial services
 
industry. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● Ebury’s remuneration of front office employees is gender agnostic as it is based on
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performance indicators that are tied to sales objectives. 

 

 

● Ebury’s mean gender pay gap of 27% reflects the composition of our headcount - our
 
front office accounts for 76% of our total workforce, which in turn is primarily made up of
 
 
90% of male employees. Therefore, the amount of remuneration for front office staff and
 
for senior revenue generators amplifies the pay gap. 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● With regards to Ebury’s back office (24% of the total headcount) 45% of back office are
 
female employees who hold 36% of back office managerial roles and 56% of senior roles
 
within back office. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● If the gender pay gap for back office is reviewed only, the mean hourly gender pay gap is

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
significantly reduced (see figure below):

● The top quartile has the lowest amount of female representation across all four quartiles,

 
whereas it is the quartile with the highest amount of male representation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● There is a limited number of senior roles within the company and the turnover of staff at
 
this level is very small which means vacancies do not arise as frequently as compared to
 
 
more junior roles.

● Continuing to actively drive a gender-balanced intake of graduate recruitment. 
● Continue developing our internal policies and processes to ensure that all recruitment

Summary 
  
 
Through the initiatives and programmes that Ebury have implemented to date, we believe that
 
we are making real progress to achieving not only a better gender pay balance but also an
environment that supports and encourages women to succeed at Ebury. Whilst we are aware
 
that this will take time, the company remain committed and they shall continue to promote
 
internal and external initiatives and programmes to ensure the equality of the gender pay gap
 
over time. 
  
  
I confirm that the data in this report is accurate.
