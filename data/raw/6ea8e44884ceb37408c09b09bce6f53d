We respect each and every one of our employees and we are driving a number of initiatives to meet this goal. Unit4 embraces the need to publish our gender pay report as we welcome transparency but we also want to be clear that demonstrating differentials in pay based on gender is not our sole focus, we are equally as focused on creating an environment that is fair and equal for all of our employees.
