Gender Pay Reporting

The Gender Pay reporting regulations require all UK legal 
entities with over 250 employees to publish the following 
sets of data annually:

•  Mean and median gender pay gap (hourly earnings)

•  Mean and median gender bonus gap 

(for those receiving a bonus)

•  Proportion of men and women that received a bonus

•  Proportion of men and women working in different 

pay quartiles 

This data is designed to look at the difference in the average 
pay of men and women regardless of their role or level 
within the Company.  This is different to Equal Pay which 
focuses on equal pay for equal work.

How we are closing the pay gap

Managing Director Statement

We are committed to investing in ongoing initiatives to help 
ensure a balanced participation in the workforce and support 
a reduction in the gender pay gap: 

•  encouragement of flexible working; we already offer 
enhanced family leave and support employees with 
their return to work following adoption, maternity and 
parental leave

•  we will implement an unconscious bias training 

module for our managers and will continue to look at 
ways to support managers to create high-performing 
inclusive teams

•  we will mentor women identified as talent within the 
organisation to help create a stronger female talent 
pipeline for senior roles

The Company is committed to offering equal employment 
opportunities and its policies are designed to attract, 
retain and motivate the best staff regardless of gender, 
sexual orientation, race, religion, age, disability or 
educational background.

I can confirm the accuracy of the data presented in this 
report as at 5 April 2017 and that it has been calculated 
in accordance with the legislation and guidelines for 
gender pay reporting.
