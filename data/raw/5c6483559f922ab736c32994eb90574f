Log in      The Evening Standard has revealed an average gender pay gap of 12.8 per cent, lower than the national average.  The snapshot of the 374 employees at Evening Standard Ltd in April 2017 found that average pay rates still had some way to go before they reached parity.  However, if the yardstick used is the median — the person ranked halfway between the highest and lowest paid — then the picture is very different with women actually ahead by 5.8 per cent.      As with other employers in the sector, the survey found that men filled more of the higher paid roles. Of the 25 per cent best paid roles in the company, 61.3 per cent were held by men, and  38.7 per cent by women.  There is also a wider gap when it comes to bonus payments with men’s top-up pay 51 per cent higher as an average, but only 11.2 per cent more when measured as a median.  The Government requires all companies with more than 250 employees to publish gender pay data. Figures revealed in the media industry include average gaps of 35 per cent at The Telegraph, 32.5 per cent at The Economist, 24.4 per cent at the Financial Times, 19.6 per cent at ITN and 10.7 per cent for the BBC. The national average at April last year was 18.4 per cent.    George Osborne, Editor of the Evening Standard, said: “We’re working hard to promote more women and create a diverse working culture.  “While our average gender pay gap is lower than most other media organisations, and it’s great news that the median pay of women is actually higher than men here, there’s still lots more work to do. I am confident we’re heading in the right direction.”      Manish Malhotra, managing director of the Evening Standard’s owner ESI Media Group, said: “We are committed to recruiting more women into senior roles and developing an easier pathway for women to progress.  "Initiatives to help us achieve that goal include a commitment to ensuring women are shortlisted for senior jobs, anonymised CVs, improved maternity benefits and more flexible working for men and women.”    More about:  |  Gender pay gap                         Reuse content                  Comments       Login or register to comment      Hello {{nickname}}  ( Logout )          Post    Please be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our    Community Guidelines.
