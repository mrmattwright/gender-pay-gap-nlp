That means we have the same rates of pay for men and women in the same role and gender is not a factor when we’re choosing the right people to work here.  We’re a family business with a deeply embedded family culture. We strive to attract, retain and develop the best people. As a result we have a deeply committed and loyal workforce and all our people are encouraged to take part in a share incentive plan, so that they really feel part of the company.  Every year we recognise the long service of our people with awards for those who have been at the brewery for ten, 20 and 30 years, sometimes even 40 years. We’re proud that our people stay with us for a long time.  We are also a fairly complex business with a diverse set of roles and functions ranging from manufacturing and packaging to property management and engineering. Some of these have historically attracted more men than women, but we actively encourage female applicants to all vacancies and are now seeing more and more women join the business, throughout the brewery and in more senior roles. We are committed to ensuring the gender mix becomes balanced across the business.  We have a total of 1,514 employees, spread across the brewery, head office and our managed pubs, bars and hotels.  Of these 714 are women and 800 are men.               26.9% Mean (average) gender pay gap  This is the difference between the average male hourly rate and the average female hourly rate. This gives a result of 26.92%, indicating that we have more men in higher paid jobs.  1.3% Median gender pay gap  This is calculated by taking the lowest and highest hourly rates for men and women and finding the rate of pay in the middle point of these ranges, then subtracting the difference. This results in a median gender pay gap of 1.32%, again showing we have more men than women in higher paid jobs.  44.1% Bonus pay gap  This is the difference between average bonus payments to men and women, giving a percentage difference of 44.11%. This reflects the higher number of men in more senior positions where bonuses are paid. Only a small proportion of the company actually receives a bonus (see below) and this doesn’t take into account the share bonus scheme which operates throughout the company.  22.9% Median bonus gap  The difference between the median or midpoint of male and female bonus ranges is 22.92%.  Bonus proportions  13.9% Male 4.5% Female  The proportion of men who received a bonus is 13.95%, while 4.53% of women received a bonus, indicating we have more men in bonus-led positions.   Quartile distribution : female/male  The quartile distribution is the number of male and female employees in each of four pay bands: the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands.  Q1  Lower 55.3% female, 44.7 % male, that’s 209 women and 169 men. Q2  Lower middle 55.2%  female, 44.8% male, or 209 women and 170 men. Q3  Upper middle 48.2%  female, 51.8% male, which is 182 women and 196 men. Q4  Upper 30.1% female, 69.9% male, which is 114 women and 265 men.
