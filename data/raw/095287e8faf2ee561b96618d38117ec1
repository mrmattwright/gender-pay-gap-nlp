Making sure that this is at the heart of our organisation is essential to enable us to successfully fulfill our role and duties to the patients we treat, and as an employer.  It is important that we ensure the needs of patients, visitors and staff are met when designing and delivering our services irrespective of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnerships, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex and sexual orientation.    Our progress towards meeting this objective is monitored by the Trust Board throughout the year. Specific actions include establishing a Fairness and Equality Action Group for staff.      Equality Information  The law places a responsibility on the Trust to show that we have considered equality by ensuring that we:   Remove or minimizing disadvantages suffered by people due to their protected characteristics  Taking steps to meet the needs of people from protected groups where these are different from the needs of other people.  Encouraging people from protected groups to participate in public life or in other activities where their participation is disproportionately low.   The Isle of Wight is a diverse place to live and work. Based on mid-2010 figures the population of the Island was 140,500 with a gender break-down of:    Males approx 68,000  Females approx 72,000    Compared with the South East Region, the Island has a greater proportion of residents over the age of 65 years and fewer younger residents.
