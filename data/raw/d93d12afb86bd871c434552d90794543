Gender Pay 
Gap Report

introduction

Edelman is committed to a 
diverse and inclusive workforce 
where everyone is valued 
equally, and all employees 
feel respected. We have robust 
processes in place to ensure our 
approach to pay and reward is 
based on fairness and that our 
people are treated equally.

However, we have identified a gender 
pay gap when we compare the overall 
average pay and bonuses of our male and 
female staff. While our gender pay gap 
is lower than the current ONS national 
average, we recognise there is still work 
to do to reduce it further.

The gap is measured by comparing the 
overall female population of the firm with 
the overall male population, rather than 
looking at like-for-like roles. In our case, 
this entails comparing a larger group of 
female employees with a smaller group 
of male employees. Our female employee 
population is distributed more evenly 
across all levels of the firm, but our male 
population skews towards middle to 
senior roles, which is causing the gap.

While this is true of many organisations, 
we recognise that the overall composition 
of our UK business is different from 
many other industries in the UK. 
The PRCA recently revealed that the 
demographic makeup of the PR industry 
is 66 per cent female and 34 per cent 
male, which is very close to our 63:37 split.

With this workplace composition, 
we are unlikely to achieve absolute 
gender balance across all roles in the 
organisation, which is why we strive for 
50:50 gender parity in our most senior 
roles. We are pleased to say we are close 
to achieving 50:50 gender balance 
at the top of the organisation and that 
continues to be our goal. 

We also recognise the importance of 
promoting and developing the next 
generation of leaders and ensuring there 
are opportunities for everyone at Edelman 
to progress in their careers.

Specific initiatives to address this include 
investment in career management 
and leadership development for those 
in middle and senior management 
roles. Additionally, we offer informal 
and formal mentoring schemes for 
all employees. We will continue to 
strengthen recruitment practices by 
ensuring female candidates are sought 
for all disciplines, and shortlists and 
interview panels are gender balanced. 
And each member of the Edelman UK 
executive committee will have a personal 
objective and a departmental plan relating 
to diversity and inclusion.

Edelman is committed to helping 
staff balance careers with caring 
responsibilities, and we are proud of 
our enhanced maternity offering, which 
we are confident is industry-leading.

We strongly support the legislation 
requiring organisations with 250 or more 
employees to publish data on the gender 
pay gap. While the metrics only tell 
part of the story, it is our view that the 
conversations they are promoting both in 
our own firm and more broadly are helpful.

We believe this is 
a step in the right 
direction toward 
making the UK 
a fairer society.

WHAT IS 
GENDER PAY? 
WHAT IS 
EQUAL PAY?

equal pay
Equal pay is the legal right for 
men and women to be paid the same 
when doing the same or similar 
work, or work of equal value.

gender pay gap
The gender pay gap is the difference 
in average pay and bonuses between 
men and women irrespective of role.

our 
numbers
pay gap
The table below shows our overall median and mean gender 
pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as of the snapshot date 
of 5 April 2017. We have a median (middle) gender pay gap 
of 10.36% and a mean gender pay gap of 21.33%. The 
current ONS national average is 18.4% median.

WHAT ARE WE 
REQUIRED TO REPORT?
The government requires employers to report both the 
median and mean gender pay gaps and bonus gaps in their 
workforce, as well as information on the proportion of men 
and women awarded a bonus, and the proportion of men 
and women when divided into four groups (quartiles) from 
lowest to highest pay. Median and mean calculations were 
used when comparing bonuses for men and women from 6 
April 2016 to 5 April 2017, in line with the government’s 
reporting requirements.

The median is the figure that falls in the middle of a 
range when everyone’s wages are lined up from smallest 
to largest. The median gap is the difference between the 
employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the 
middle employee in the range of female wages.

The mean, commonly known as the average, is calculated 
when you add up the wages of all employees and divide 
the figure by the number of employees. The mean gender 
pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean 
female pay.

pay quartiles
Edelman is made up of 63% women and 37% men. The 
total population of 479 was divided into the four pay groups 
seen here, each containing approximately 120 employees.

The data shows there are more women than men 
in every pay quartile.

Percentage of Employees 
Receiving a Bonus
Of the 272 bonuses paid, the majority were discretionary 
ad hoc bonuses paid to junior/mid-level staff – a larger 
share of whom are women. Whereas a higher proportion 
of the total male population received business performance-
related bonuses. So, while a larger share of the female 
population received bonus pay in 2017 (56.74% vs 51.12% 
for men), we still had a median and mean gender bonus 
gap favourable towards men.

our 
progress 
so far

Since 2012, our median score has gone 
from 16.11% to 10.36%; close to a 6 pt 
improvement. And our mean score has 
similarly improved from 24.33% to 21.33%. 
Similarly, our female representation in the 
top quartile has improved by 7 percentage 
points since 2012.

Equally, where women used to make 
up 32% of the most senior roles in 2012, 
today the figure is 46%; the vast majority 
of whom (68%) were promoted internally 
into their roles.

We have taken a number of actions over the 
years that we attribute to the positive trend 
we’re seeing in reducing our gap.

2017

The statutory reporting requires us 
to report on where we are at a moment 
in time but we wanted to go a step 
further. So, we backdated the tracking 
to 2012 in order to determine a trend 
line for the firm.

We felt it was important not only 
to benchmark ourselves against our 
industry but our own past progress as 
well. e 
ndustry but ourselves.

We have three focus areas:
Culture and leadership
We offer a competitive enhanced maternity 
policy to support the demands of parenting. We 
are committed to the initiatives being led at a 
global level through our Global Women’s 
Executive Network which is striving for 50:50 
gender balance at a senior level across the 
organisation.

Fairness
We have a regular structured performance review 
process, and we have introduced more robust 
processes around our compensation planning and 
approvals to ensure all pay and promotion 
processes are fair, balanced and have appropriate 
oversight. We engage regularly with employee 
forums and use various touchpoints to make 
changes where necessary.

Benchmarking and targets
We regularly conduct internal and external 
benchmarking to ensure our salary bands are 
in line with market data and our compensation 
structure remains fair, relevant and competitive.

what’s 
next?

We have almost achieved 50:50 gender 
parity at our most senior levels and that 
continues to be our goal. We also recognise 
that we need to do more to promote and 
develop the next generation of leaders. So, 
to that end, we will remain focused on the 
three areas of culture and leadership, 
fairness, and benchmarking and targets.

Culture and leadership
We want to encourage more flexible working and 
shared parental leave and have formed a working 
parents group to better understand the challenges 
facing our parents, and how we can better support 
them. We are investing in career management and 
leadership development for those in middle and 
senior management roles, and continue to drive 
development initiatives through our Global 
Women’s Executive Network.

Fairness
We are rolling out training for our hiring 
managers to ensure we are making effective 
hiring decisions, and will be offering a variety 
of development opportunities in areas including 
people management, unconscious bias, and 
diversity and inclusion.

Benchmarking and targets
We will continue to strengthen recruitment 
practices by ensuring female candidates are sought 
for all disciplines, and shortlists and interview 
panels are gender balanced where possible. Each 
member of the Edelman UK executive committee 
will have a personal objective and a departmental 
plan relating to diversity and inclusion.
