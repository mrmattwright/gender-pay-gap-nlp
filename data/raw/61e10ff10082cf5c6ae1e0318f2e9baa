Gender Pay Gap Report 2017    Verdict 2016  2016 saw a marginal increase in turnover from £76.6m to £77.1m, however of greater importance is the ability to generate profit. With this in mind, an increase in gross profit to 125% (2015 11.2%) represents an exceptional performance from our most important asset, our people. The people we employ are undoubtedly our greatest asset and the board appreciate the continued loyalty, dedication, hard work and professionalism of both our staff and operatives.  During the year the group has been awarded a number of new Frameworks. Of particular note was Jackson Civil Engineering securing its place on the £240m M25 civils contract with Connect Plus, for a guaranteed ten year duration. Jackson Civil Engineering has worked with Connect Plus since its inception some seven years ago. The award of this framework for a ten year period clearly illustrates the importance Jackson Civil Engineering places on working collaboratively with our clients in long term relationships.
