Home    Company    Compliance    Compliance  As a family-owned enterprise and globally operating logistics service provider, DACHSER has a responsibility toward society and its standards.      Transparent regulations for the company, its entities and employees.     Apart from its own moral commitments and values, ongoing monitoring is an additional reason for us to conduct all business and services in an ethical and legally flawless manner. To avoid any conflict of interests, all DACHSER employees, without exception, comply with the applicable laws in all the markets served by us, as well as our internal regulations. They also observe the customs, traditions and society values of the various countries. Our compliance management includes a DACHSER code of conduct as well as the DACHSER behaviour policy guidelines that provide direct guidance to more than 27,450 employees worldwide.       DACHSER Group SE & Co. KG Managing Board Compliance Statement (2018)  Our compliance motto, Integrity in Logistics, reflects our company’s long-held aspiration to achieve sustainable cooperation between DACHSER and its business partners.  We believe that successful relationships between reputable businesspeople rely especially on both parties behaving with integrity. Our compliance motto is evidence of this conviction, and above all it is a bar we set ourselves. Equally, it indicates the expectations we have of our business partners. Mutual trust in the other partner’s integrity is the foundation of successful business dealings.  To this end, we take all necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that our internal compliance efforts are applied and enforced across all DACHSER country organizations. In the future, we also want to focus on forging sensible and effective links between our own compliance activities and the compliance requirements of our business partners; we are happy to take the lead on this issue.  Beyond sharing documents and guidelines with each other and asking for them to be accepted and signed, we believe it is important to seek direct dialogue with each business partner so as to facilitate specific discussions that explore the respective requirements as they have been codified. An open dialogue offers every opportunity to arrive at a mutual understanding of each party’s intentions - without restricting or limiting anyone’s compliance efforts - as well as to minimize misunderstandings and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy. We are certain that our business partners will appreciate our initiating this additional impulse.  Strict observance of competition and antitrust law is essential to our Compliance Management System. In its commitment to free and fair competition, DACHSER respects market forces. It is DACHSER’s unwavering policy to conduct all business in compliance with valid competition and antitrust laws. Any and all arrangements, agreements, or coordinated efforts with the competition, as well as any anticompetitive sharing of data or information, are strictly prohibited and constitute business behavior that DACHSER will not tolerate. Violations will incur penalties as set forth under the relevant competition, antitrust, and labor law statutes.

These measures aim to guarantee the economic success, and therefore the future viability of the company.        Corporate Governance  As a 100% family-owned company, DACHSER has committed itself to the transparent regulations of good governance.          Copyright © 2018 DACHSER SE.
