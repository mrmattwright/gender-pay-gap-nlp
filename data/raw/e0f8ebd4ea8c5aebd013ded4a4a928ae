If we work both individually and collectively 
to improve equality, then we all benefit: 
businesses can access the widest possible pool 
of talented people, individuals can fulfil their 
potential and the economy benefits. 
We will use this report to have quality 
conversations with our people about what we 
can do to improve, and we will also be actively 
working with partners from across the retail 
sector to identify and champion best practice.

 

Belinda Deery, Chief People Officer

As a business employing more than 14,000 
people around the world, we see the 
reporting of gender pay gap information  
as a real opportunity to gain insight and  
take practical action to increase inclusivity  
in business. Progress has been made in recent 
years, but there is clearly much more that  
can and should be done.
By establishing the facts and the root causes 
of the gaps that exist, we can progress to 
examining the underlying issues within our 
business, our sector and wider society. 
We place great importance on this work, 
recognising that inclusivity is much broader 
than gender balance. For the purposes of 
this report, though, our information relates 
to comparing the pay of males and females 
using the approach required by the UK 
Government’s regulations.
The statistics within the report provide us with 
some useful information that will enable us to 
identify and remove barriers to equality, so we 
can drive meaningful and sustainable change 
within our business.

HOW ARE THE GENDER PAY GAPS CALCULATED?
Following the reporting regulations set out by the UK Government,  
we have extracted data about the pay of our 8,446 UK colleagues  
as at 5th April 2017. 
The median gender pay gap is calculated as follows: if all our UK 
employees were lined up in a female line and a male line, in order of 
pay from highest to lowest, the median gap is the difference in hourly 
pay of the female in the middle of her line when compared to the 
hourly pay of the man in the middle of his line.
It does not compare the pay of men and women doing the same role.
The mean gender pay gap compares the average hourly pay of men, 
with that of women. This figure is heavily influenced by the numbers of 
men and women in different roles.
Calculations for median and mean figures are also carried out in  
relation to bonus pay over the year to 5th April 2017, and we also  
show the proportion of men and women receiving any bonus pay 
during that period. 

PAY QUARTILES 
The report also illustrates the proportion of men and women in four 
'pay quartiles'. The quartiles are calculated by splitting employees into 
four groups of an equal number of people, based on their pay.

WHAT’S INCLUDED IN EACH CALCULATION? 
The data for both the mean and median gender pay gaps, and the pay 
quartiles, includes both ordinary and bonus pay as defined below,  
based on data as at 5th April 2017.
Ordinary pay includes basic pay, but also other pay such as leave pay 
and shift allowances. Overtime, redundancy or benefits in any form 
other than money are not included. 
Bonus pay includes our retail incentive scheme and our annual bonus 
scheme – and any other additional pay that relates to profit sharing or 
performance. This is the same definition used for bonus pay in relation 
to the bonus pay gap.

In common with the retail sector and the 
country in general, the key factor influencing 
our gender pay gap is the balance of men and 
women across different job levels.
At a headline level, 71% of our colleagues are 
female and 29% are male. However, most of 
our lower paid roles, in our retail stores, are 
held by women, whereas most higher paid 
roles, in our global headquarters in the UK,  
are held by men.
The following graphics show the overall 
gender balance in our business and within 
different work levels and types of role.

Due to our bonuses for senior roles being 
calculated as a percentage of pay, having more 
men in our most senior, highest paid roles also 
drives the bonus pay gap. So, despite more 
women than men receiving some form of 
bonus or incentive payment (64.7% of women 
compared to 50.7% of men), the average 
bonus for women was 49.6% lower than that 
for men, whilst the difference at the median 
was 6.2%.

PROPORTION OF WOMEN 
RECEIVING BONUS

64.7%

Behind these numbers there are differences 
in the proportion of men and women in 
different areas of our business. Our pay ranges 
for our different functions vary, to account for 
market value, and therefore the proportions 
of men and women in different functions of 
our business also has an effect on our gap. 
As highlighted in the introduction, we are 
interested in driving meaningful and sustainable 
change. We know there are some things  
we could do to reduce our percentage gap  
– for example, seeking to recruit more men 
into retail store roles – however, we want to 
focus on tackling the barriers in place and 
improving opportunities for everyone.

PROPORTION OF MEN 
RECEIVING BONUS

50.7%

In order to address this imbalance, one of the 
key areas we will focus on is exploring why a 
smaller proportion of women progress to the 
more senior roles in our business. We will be 
working with our employees across Clarks to 
help us understand and address this.

Our ambition is to close the gap. There are some steps we can take 
in the short term and also some longer-term actions we can take to 
ensure we are addressing the gap. We are committed to unlocking 
career progression for colleagues who desire it and using the skills  
and talents of our global and diverse workforce in our business.  
Our current and new initiatives will improve how we attract, engage  
and develop women (as well as other under-represented groups). 
These include:

RAISING AWARENESS AND REMOVING BIAS 
We will make learning and development initiatives which raise 
awareness and understanding of unconscious bias available for all 
colleagues. We will also seek to have recruitment shortlists for  
senior roles that are balanced between male and female candidates.

INCREASING ACCESS INTO LEADERSHIP ROLES 
We will build on our training and mentoring programmes, supporting 
colleagues at all stages of their careers in their development into 
leadership and as leaders. We will focus on providing specific, targeted  
support for our female talent to progress their careers into and 
through our leadership levels.

BUILDING INTERNAL NETWORKS 
We will use group coaching and mentoring programmes to connect, 
inspire and better understand the experiences of under-represented 
groups, including women, across the business.

DEVELOPING OUR ATTITUDES TOWARDS  
FLEXIBLE WORKING 
All our colleagues can request to work flexibly and research shows 
that flexible working helps support the progression of women, for 
instance those with caring responsibilities. We will look to develop 
blueprints for more flexible roles and will be identifying role models 
to demonstrate the value uncovered by a flexible working approach.

SUPPORT NATIONAL CAMPAIGNS 
Our CEO, Mike Shearwood, and Chief People Officer, Belinda Deery, 
are both ambassadors for Retail Week’s 'Be Inspired' campaign, which 
seeks to improve the representation of women in the retail industry 
by proactively engaging female leaders. Clarks has also signed up to 
the British Retail Consortium’s 'Better Retail, Better World' sustainable 
development goals, which include reducing inequality.

We can confirm that this report and the information within is accurate.
