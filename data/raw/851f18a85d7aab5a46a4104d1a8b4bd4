(published March 2018)      We are required by law 1 to publish an
Annual Gender Pay Gap report in a prescribed format. We have added
some supporting information at the end of the report.  This is our first report using data from March
2017 and was published 29 March 2018.  The Gender Pay Gap report includes all staff
permanently and temporarily employed on the 'snapshot' date which
was 31March 2017.  On 31 st March 2017 the Council had
475 employees: 197 male and 278 female. For the purposes of
reporting on the gender pay gap, there are 466 'relevant'
employees, of whom 195 are men and 271 are women.  1)  The difference between the average
(mean and median) hourly rate of pay for male and female
employees:          Mean Hourly Rate    Median Hourly Rate      Male    £15.07    £13.95      Female    £13.16    £11.81      % difference in hourly rate of pay    12.6%    15.4%        2)  The difference between the average
(mean and median) bonuses paid to male and female employees over
the period of 12 months ending with the snapshot date of 31
March.  We do not pay bonuses so there is no gap on
which to report.  3)  The proportion of male employees and of
female employees who were paid bonuses during the period of 12
months ending with the snapshot date of 31 March.  We do not pay bonuses so there is no gap on
which to report.  4)  The proportions of male and female
employees in each quartile of the pay distribution. The table below
shows our pay quartiles by gender. Pay quartiles are calculated by
listing all employees in order of their hourly pay, and then
grouping into four equal groups - called quartiles.      Quartile    Total    Men (Count)    Men    Women (Count)    Women ( % )      ( % )      A - Lower Quartile (0-25%)    117    45    38.46%    72    61.54%      B - Lower Middle Quartile (25-50%)    116    30    25.86%    86    74.14%      C - Upper Middle Quartile (50-75%)    117    51    43.59%    66    56.41%      D - Upper Quartile (75-100%)    116    69    59.48%    47    40.52%      Total Posts    466    195        271          Additional information and analysis of our gender pay gap.  SSDC uses a recognised job evaluation scheme to ensure that men
and women are paid the same for work of equal value, and we will
continue to be rigorous to meet this long-standing legal duty.
Further analysis of the gender pay gap, to better understand the
causes and ways to eliminate our current gender pay gap, will draw
upon national best practice and learning.  Our data tells us that on average male employees
earn more than female employees. There are a number of reasons for
this, for example because there is a higher percentage (%) of men
in higher grades and because more women work part-time (less than
37 hours per week) than men. Part-time roles tend to be amongst the
lower paid roles within the organisation such as customer advisors
and administration. Another cause of the gender pay gap may be the
employment of men and women in roles that traditionally attract
specific genders.  Like all employers, SSDC has a set of unique
circumstances which affects the gender profile of its workforce,
for example unlike many other councils we do not directly employ
staff to carry out household waste collections or housing repairs.
These services tend to attract mostly male employees and are at
lower grades, so including these employees would have reduced the
gender pay gap. Again, our detailed analysis will help us
understand the degree to which these differences in the make-up of
our workforce have affected our gender pay gap.  In addition more women than men tend to have
responsibilities as the primary carer at home and at SSDC can take
a reduced salary in return for extra annual leave or child care
vouchers. These 'family friendly' benefits are highly valued by our
staff - and reduce the average pay data we were required to use
within our report.  The Council is currently undergoing a
significant programme of change, and the gender pay gap results
will help inform our new People Strategy.  We are already
designing our organisation to be flexible to suit different styles
of working, increasing our investment into training and learning,
and increasing the range of opportunities to progress within the
organisation. We will continue to work to ensure we eliminate the
gender pay gap where this could be linked to career progression or
job design, or the way we recruit into different roles. Further
analysis and consultation with staff will help us to better
understand the position, and ways to further improve equality of
employment at all levels within the organisation.  As stated above, it is important to know that a gender pay gap
is not about unequal pay for work of equal value,
which is prohibited in law by the Equal Pay Act 1975. We operate a
recognised job evaluation scheme which covers all posts within the
Council, and helps us to ensure work of equal value is equally
rewarded.    1 The Equality Act 2010
