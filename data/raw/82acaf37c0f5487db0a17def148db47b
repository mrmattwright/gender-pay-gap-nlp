In response, the University of Bedfordshire has now published this data. This showed that the mean average hourly rates of pay for women at the University were 14.6% lower than that of men. The University takes any form of inequality very seriously and strongly supports the efforts made to scrutinise any evidence of gender pay discrimination. For this reason, we have examined the reasons for the difference in average hourly salaries identified. Based on this, we do not believe that the University pays men and women differently for the same or equivalent work, but instead the reasons for the difference in average salaries appear more complex. Overall, the University employs more women than men. Of those included in the gender pay gap data, 648 were women and 406 were men. Women work in every department of the University. There are more women than men on the University’s executive and 54% of those in the upper quartile of salaries are women. Whilst there are more women than men in senior and high-paid positions at our university, there are also more women in jobs earning lower salaries. Analysis shows that the gender pay gap identified at the University is not caused by women earning less than men or by women being excluded from senior positions. Instead the gap is caused by the larger number of women in roles for which both men and women earn lower salaries. Creating an inclusive culture and ensuring equality and diversity are matters than lie at the very heart of the University of Bedfordshire’s purpose and mission. It is greatly concerning that there is evidence of a gender pay gap in the UK, and we will continue to scrutinise and monitor our own data and practices to ensure that women and men have the same opportunities and rewards at the University.
