GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

MESSAGE FROM 

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE

PAUL BURTON

Group CEO

The Briggs & Forrester Group, like many other 
companies in the Building Services and Construction 
sector currently experience a gender pay gap. This is 
primarily due to fewer women employed in senior roles 
within our business although we're working on ways to 
change this. 

With Construction being misrepresented but well 
known for being a manual, male dominated industry, 
we will be working hard to encourage a new 
generation of women to come and work for us.

Our objective, representing clients aspirations is to 
improve the representation of women across all levels 
of Briggs & Forester Group, providing a more diverse 
workforce. This will include ensuring more women are 
employed through our technical and craft training 
schemes aspiring to a 1:4 ratio on selection intakes 
each year.

THE PAY GAP

What is the gender pay gap?

The gender pay gap is an equality measure that shows 
the difference in average earnings between men and 
women. New legislation requires all employers with 
250 or more employees to publish their gender pay 
gap annually.

Why is there a gender pay gap?

The causes of the gender pay gap are complex and 
overlapping. There are many reasons that a gender pay 
gap exists, these include, a divided labour market, the 
number of men and women in roles at a senior level 
and also higher proportion of women working part-
time due to caring responsibilities.

What is included in the calculations?

Basic pay at 5 April 2017, including cash allowances 
such as car, London and on-call during the pay period 
covering 5 April 2017.

Bonus pay for the year to 5 April 2017, including profit 
related pay bonus, study reward bonus, business 
performance bonus and other incentive bonuses.

THE PAY GAP

Calculating the mean and median gaps

The calculations make use of two types of averages:

• A mean average involves adding up all of the 
numbers and dividing the result by how many numbers 
were in the list.

• A median average involves listing all of the numbers 
in numerical order. If there is an odd number of results, 
the median average is the middle number. If there is an 
even number of results, the median will be the mean of 
the two central numbers.

Calculating the pay quartiles

This calculation required Briggs & Forrester to show 
the proportions of male and female full-pay relevant 
employees in four quartile pay bands, which is done 
by dividing the workforce into four equal parts, 
and calculating the percentage of male and female 
employees in each of these groups.
