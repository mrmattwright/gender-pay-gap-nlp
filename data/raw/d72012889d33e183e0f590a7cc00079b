The Group is focused on acting responsibly, not only in the way we invest and engage with our clients, but also in supporting our employees, managing our impact on the environment and contributing to the communities in which we work.

Further information on our approach and commitments to corporate responsibility will follow in due course.  Modern slavery and human trafficking  Janus Henderson supports all efforts to eradicate forced labour and other abuses of human rights.  The Group’s executive management attested to the statement below in regards to Janus Henderson’s approach to modern slavery and human trafficking.   Janus Henderson Modern Slavery Act Statement  Janus Henderson Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy   Equality and diversity  Fostering diversity and developing an inclusive work environment are important priorities for our firm. We recognise that, to be successful, leadership must be committed to championing these efforts and ensuring they are engrained in our company’s culture and business model. To achieve this, Janus Henderson established a global Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee, with representation from leaders across the business.  Janus Henderson signed the UK Government’s Women in Finance Charter in July 2017. Through this charter, we have committed to increasing the percentage of women in senior management roles at Janus Henderson. Furthermore, Janus Henderson’s participation in the Charter is indicative of the Group’s overall focus on increasing gender and minority representation across the business.  Janus Henderson is an equal opportunities employer and has appropriate human resource policies and procedures in place to ensure employees work in an environment free from discrimination and harassment.  Our policies and practices attract and retain a diverse and flexible workforce. This includes giving full and fair consideration to applications from, and the continued employment of, people with disabilities and learning difficulties.   Janus Henderson Equality and Diversity Policy   UK gender pay gap  In compliance with UK Government requirements, Janus Henderson published its first gender pay gap report for 2017. The report details the average difference in pay and bonuses between female and male employees based in the UK.  When considering pay and diversity, we need to think of two separate measures. First to make sure we are paying equally for equal work. The second measure to consider is the distribution of employees across the spectrum of seniority from a diversity perspective. This second area is the subject of Janus Henderson's UK gender pay gap report.   2017 Gender Pay Gap Report   Janus Henderson recognises the imperative to make progress in diversifying teams at every level. Diversity empowers different perspectives and insights, which together make a better business. For more information about Janus Henderson's philosophy on diversity, please click here .
