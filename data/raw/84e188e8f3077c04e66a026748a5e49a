           Wipro announces gender pay gap
           details in Great Britain 

Under UK legislation, introduced in 2017, employers in 
Great Britain (GB) with 250 employees or more must 
publish their gender pay gap by 4 April 2018 and 
thereafter every successive year. The objective of the 
gender pay gap reporting is to establish the difference 
between the mean and median earnings (hourly pay) of 
men and women, as well as the bonus payout by 
gender, and the ratio of male and female employees 
across the business. 
Wipro is an equal opportunities employer and we 
welcome this move by the UK government to ensure 
more transparency at the workplace. In line with the 

parameters outlined under the legislation, Wipro’s 
mean gender pay gap is 13.8% and the median gender 
pay gap is 7.7% for our employees in GB. 87% of our 
employees in GB are in the junior and mid-level career 
bands. The pay gap in these bands is lower as 
compared to the overall company ﬁgures in GB. In fact, 
in our core middle management level, female 
employees on an average are paid more than their 
male counterparts. This reafﬁrms our commitment to 
focus on hiring, training and deploying talent, based on 
skills, experience and meritocracy.

However, though our gender pay gap ﬁgures are 
encouraging, we recognize that there is still a lot to be 
done to create a more equitable workplace for all. For 
instance, our mean bonus pay gap in GB is at 46.7% 
and the median bonus pay gap is at 33.7%. The 
bonuses here include variable pay, incentives as well 

as commission. We need more representation of 
women in senior management roles to mitigate this 
pay gap. We continuously endeavour to encourage and 
support more women to take up high-impact 
leadership roles.

Nurturing inclusivity is a key priority of Wipro’s talent 
agenda. For us, inclusion is about respecting plurality 
of ideas, celebrating diversity and encouraging each 
person to be their authentic selves, free from any 
conscious or unconscious bias. 

Improving the gender balance at the workplace is a 
signiﬁcant step towards achieving this objective. We 
have introduced several programs under the aegis of 
“Women of Wipro” to mentor high potential female 

employees for leadership roles. These initiatives are 
based on a life-stage approach because we realize 
that at various stages, the needs of female employees 
differ. Our recruiters are trained in gender inclusive 
interviewing skills. Our commitment to making 
inclusion a ‘way of life’ at Wipro is reinforced by our 
leadership, including our CEO and Executive Director, 
Abidali Neemuchwala, who is the Executive Sponsor of 
Wipro’s Inclusion & Diversity (I & D) Council.

Compact and supports the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights (The UN 
Guiding Principles). We have been working on multiple 
initiatives aligned with the UN’s themes of Sustainable 
Development Goals. We have also been recognized in 

various industry forums for our inclusive policies and 
practices. While we are proud of our achievements, we 
recognize that this journey is an ever-evolving one and 
will continue to strive towards creating an inclusive 
workplace where every employee is empowered to 
deliver the best.
