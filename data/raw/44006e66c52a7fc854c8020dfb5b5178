The gender pay gap shows the difference in earnings between all male and female employees in an organisation as at 5 th April 2017.    We are required to report in six different ways;   Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay  Median gender pay gap in hourly pay  Mean gender bonus gap  Median gender bonus gap  Proportion of men and women who received bonuses  Number of men and women in each quartile pay band     The results for Fairhurst are as follows:  .                                         Mean    Median  Gender Pay Gap               19.0%    21.0%  Bonus Pay Gap                 -14.5%  -24.9%  A positive percentage figure means that overall, female employees have lower pay or bonuses than male colleagues. A negative figure means that overall male employees have lower pay or bonuses than female colleagues. The roles and responsibilities  of individual employees does not feature in the calculation of the percentage comparisons.    Proportion of male employees receiving a bonus:          14.4%  Proportion of female employees receiving a bonus:       3.6%.    The proportions of males and females in each quartile band are as follows:    Band      Males    Females               Quartile  A             55.3%    44.7%                    Lower  B             74.0%    26.0%                   Lower-Middle  C             83.7%    16.3%                     Upper-Middle  D             84.6%    15.4%                    Upper    While Fairhurst operates in a historically male-dominated industry, we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our firm.    The narrowing gap in proportions of male and female employees in the Lower and Lower-Middle quartiles demonstrates the progressive change away from the historically male-dominated industry.    Principles of non-discrimination are enshrined in Fairhurst’s recruitment and promotion procedures. All recruitment and promotion decisions are made on merit.    I confirm that data contained in this report is accurate.    Ron Bryson  Senior Partner    Link to Gary Gabriel Associates Gender Pay Gap Report .
