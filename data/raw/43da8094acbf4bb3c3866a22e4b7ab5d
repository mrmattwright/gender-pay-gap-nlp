Our mean gender pay gap was 33.1% at 5 April 2017.  Countryside believes in job opportunities for everyone, regardless of gender, and our goal is to create a fully inclusive and diverse culture that reflects the society we live in. We recognise that there is work to do to close the gender pay gap in the construction industry and we are taking positive action as set out below.  Gender Pay and Gender Bonus Gap     Difference between men and women  Mean (Average)  Median (Middle)    Hourly Fixed Pay  33.1%  39.7%    Bonus Paid  50.7%  52.3%      The above figures show our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on gross hourly rates of pay paid at 5 April 2017. It also shows our mean and median bonus pay gap for bonuses paid in the year up to 5 April 2017.  The gender pay gap shows the percentage difference in hourly earnings and bonus figures for male and female employees across the workforce, irrespective of job level.  The gender pay gap data is not about equal pay. Equal pay is about ensuring that men and women doing the same or similar jobs are paid the same. At Countryside we recognise the importance of equal pay and we regularly carry out analysis of our pay and policies.  Proportion of employees receiving a bonus   Employees who joined Countryside after 1 October 2016 are excluded from this data because they are not eligible for the bonus scheme for the period under review.  Gender pay gap by quartile   The above image shows the gender distribution across four equally sized quartiles. It shows that a higher proportion of men are in the highest pay quartile, while a higher proportion of women are in the lowest pay quartile. Several jobs within the bottom quartile are administrative / secretarial, the applicants for which have historically largely been women. Construction has traditionally been an industry with a majority male workforce and our business is no different; 70% of our employees are male.  What the gender pay gap data means  This shows that at Countryside, more men are in senior roles than women. As a result of this men are paid more on average than women both in terms of hourly pay and annual bonuses.  What is Countryside doing about this?  Countryside recognises that the gender pay gap is a significant issue across the construction industry, and as such requires a long-term programme of activity to reduce it.  Fifty per cent of our Board of Directors are female, and improving inclusion and diversity is firmly on the Board agenda. We are implementing a programme with a key focus on developing women in, and encouraging women to join, the construction industry. Our specific initiatives include attracting and nurturing more female talent in to our graduate and apprentice schemes, together with the introduction of a Group-wide quarterly people review process.  We are also in the process of reviewing our maternity, paternity and flexible working policies to make them more family-friendly and inclusive.  Statement of Accuracy  I confirm that Countryside’s gender pay calculations are accurate and meet the requirements of the Regulations.
