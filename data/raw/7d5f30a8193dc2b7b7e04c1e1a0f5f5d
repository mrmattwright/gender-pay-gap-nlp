Gender Pay 

Report

Transparency and Equal-
ity Matters
We recognise that publishing 
our figures on gender pay is 
just the start of our journey, but 
it is an important step forward 
to ensuring equality and 
transparency in the workplace. 

At SHL, we are committed to creating a diverse, 
inclusive and exciting place to work – for everyone. 
Our goal is to empower every employee to build a 
successful, fulfilling career.
Our analysis shows that using our own assessment 
tools has minimised bias in the way we recruit, 
manage and develop talent. Using objective data 
to inform people decisions is vital for ensuring we 
have the right people in the right roles, and that 
we are rewarding them fairly for the work that 
they do, irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity or 
background. 
We will continue to take action to address the pay 
gap and ensure that every employee has equal 
access to opportunities. 
I confirm the gender pay gap data set out in this 
report is accurate and that my Leadership Team 
and I, are committed to maximising the potential in 
our people, by making SHL a more diverse, inclusive 
and transparent company – at every level. 

Our Gender Pay Gap
Under the new legislation that came into force in 
April 2017, all UK based employers with 250 or more 
employees, are required to publish their gender 
pay gaps. 

This is our first report on the gender pay gap. It 
accounts for more than 400 employees and it includes 
details of our overall median pay gap of 3.6% in UK 
– well below the 2017 Office of National Statistics 
(ONS) average of 18.4%  – and the difference in bonus 
payments paid to male and female employees. 

At a Glance
The tables below show overall median and mean 
gender pay based on data at the ‘snapshot dateʼ of 5 
April 2017 and bonuses paid over the 12 months prior.

Understanding the Gap
The analysis of our gender gap data shows that we have a 
lower proportion of women at more senior levels. So while 
we are delivering equal pay at all levels, we have a gender 
imbalance in leadership positions, which impacts our 
pay gap. 
We are confident that both men and women have equal 
opportunity to participate in and earn a bonus. We 
recognise successful performance in roles equally, through 
clear objective setting that aligns to overall company 
targets.   
We believe the bonus gap is predominantly driven by 
two key factors: firstly, there are a greater number of men 
in senior positions where pay and bonuses are higher, 
particularly in the commission based roles. Secondly, the 
company pro-rate bonuses for employees on long term 
leave (i.e. maternity leave, shared parental leave, long term 
sickness absence). Of these, the majority of employees go 
on maternity leave, further widening the bonus pay gap.

“I appreciate working in an environment 
where women and men cooperate to 
achieve our shared objectives. Every day, we 
work with clients to identify the best talent 
without allowing gender bias to impede 
selection and development decisions. The 
strength of female representation in our 
executive committee demonstrates we 
practice what we preach.”
Emmy Hackett, Head of Legal, SHL.

We are committed to supporting clients 
to make more confident, data-driven 
decisions about people. As experts in talent 
management, we put our own advice and 
practices into action. Tackling critical issues 
of diversity, inclusivity, transparency and 
equality, are no different.”
Nick Shaw, Managing Director – UK and 
Ireland, SHL.  

“Diversity of talent – and empowerment – 
are fundamental to our ability to succeed as 
an organisation. From my own experience, 
it is this shared belief, combined with formal 
and informal development programmes, 
strong mentors and stretch opportunities 
that that have enabled me, and other 
colleagues, to progress into leadership 
roles.”
Sim Riordan, Commercial Manager, SHL.

“For the last few years, I have been actively 
working to build a pipeline of future female 
sales leaders – and I’m proud of the progress 
we’ve made. I believe our objective selection 
process and diversity initiatives have helped 
create a stronger, more inclusive team 
culture.”
Chris Fuller, Market Director, SHL.

To solve our client’s challenges, we need 
people from different backgrounds, with 
different experiences and viewpoints. It is 
therefore vital that we all take the time to 
listen to one another and help each other 
grow. As a leader, sharing experiences and 
ideas, connecting to others and providing 
honest feedback is invaluable.”
Sarah McLellan, Director – Talent Solutions, 
SHL.
