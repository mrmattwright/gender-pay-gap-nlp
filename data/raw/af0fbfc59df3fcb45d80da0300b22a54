2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

At Aegon UK, we are determined to embrace diversity in all its forms and to create  
the conditions necessary for each employee to fulfil their potential in the workplace.   

For us, the Gender Pay Gap Report is a reminder  
of the benefits that measurement, transparency,  
and public awareness bring to important initiatives 
like gender equality.

The reasons for Aegon UK’s gender pay gap are  
similar to those identified by others in our industry,  
and we are actively seeking to address this, starting 
with obtaining a better understanding of the key  
driver of our gender pay gap: the current lower  
levels of female representation in our senior  
leadership roles.  

We are committed to creating an inclusive culture, 
ensuring equal opportunities in our workplace and  
firmly believe we are more likely to be sustainable 
and successful as a company if we help everyone  
to be the best they can be. 

I confirm the data reported is accurate.

Gender pay explained
The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between males’ and females’  
average earnings across a population, regardless of the nature of the work of the  
individual, expressed as a percentage of males’ earnings. 

The gender pay gap is separate and distinct from equal pay which involves a direct comparison of the  
earnings of males and females carrying out the same, similar, or equivalent work for an employer.
Aegon UK’s gender pay gap does not represent a problem with equal pay, as our pay review process is  
gender neutral by design. Similar to other companies in financial services, our gender pay gap can  
be attributed to the current lower levels of female representation in senior management roles, and the  
proportion of females working part time.

Females represent 49% of our workforce, however 
we have fewer numbers of females than males in 
senior, higher paid roles, and greater numbers of fe-
males than males in our junior, lower paid roles.  This 
is reflected in our pay quartile data, where only 31% 
of employees in the highest paid roles were female.  
This affects not only the pay gap, but also the bonus 
gap, as our bonus arrangements are primarily based 
on a percentage of salary.

Females represent 93% of our part time workforce, 
however the bonus pay gap calculation is based on 
the actual bonus received, rather than the pro-rated 
bonus. This means that the bonus pay gap does not 
account for part time employees.
