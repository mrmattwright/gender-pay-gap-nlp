Introduction

Henry Birch 
Chief Executive, 
The Rank Group Plc

29 March 2018

Rank understands the importance of attracting, 
hiring and keeping the best people if we are  
to meet our performance targets and deliver  
profit growth.

Rank also acknowledges that the talent available  
to companies is changing and that successful 
businesses need to recruit from a broader more 
diverse talent pool to ensure the best talent is 
appointed and retained.

A diverse workforce will help us:

Win the war  
for talent

Improve the quality  
of our decision making

Increase innovation  
and customer insight

 Increase employee  
satisfaction

 Improve Rank’s image  
and licence to operate

Rank is committed to the principle of equal 
opportunities, equal treatment for all employees, 
and paying employees equally for the same or 
equivalent work.

THE gender 
pay gap and

calculated?

• If all company employees were lined up in a 
female line and a male line, in order of pay from 
highest to lowest, the median gender pay gap 
compares the pay of the female in the middle of 
their line and the pay of the man in the middle of 
their line.

• Because different jobs pay differently and the 
number of men and women performing these 
jobs varies, a gender pay gap exists.

• The mean gender pay gap shows the difference in 
the average hourly rate of pay between men and 
women in a company.

• This is different from ‘equal pay’, which is the 
difference in pay between men and women who 
carry out the same or similar jobs.

The diagrams above show the gender  
pay gap figures for the entire UK group  
as at 5 April 2017, and includes the  
four legal entities where Rank employs  
more than 250 people in the UK and is 
required to report on. The results for the  
four legal entities can be found at the back  
of this report. 

We are confident that our gender pay gap  
does not stem from paying men and women 
differently for the same or equivalent work. 
Rank’s gender pay gap is the result of roles 
in which men and women work within 
the organisation and the salaries these 
roles attract.

Across the UK economy as a whole,  
more men than women are in senior  
roles (especially the very senior roles at the 
top of organisations), while more women 
than men are in front-line roles. Women are 
also more likely to work part time, and/or 
flexible hours, and many of the jobs that  
are available across the UK on a part time 
basis are relatively low paid.

This pattern is reflected in the make-up  
of Rank’s workforce, particularly in its  
retail operations, where the majority of 
customer facing roles are held by women, 
while a higher percentage of senior manager 
roles are held by men.

While Rank’s gender pay gap for the  
overall group compares positively with  
that of organisations both across the  
whole UK economy and within the 
Gambling and Betting sector, this is not  
a subject about which Rank is complacent, 
and it is committed to doing everything  
that it can to reduce the gap.

We recognise that we have some way  
to go on this but work has already started 
and the Chief Executive, Henry Birch, has 
expressed Rank’s responsibility for enabling 
every employee, regardless of gender, to  
have a fulfilling career with the company. 
Henry has stressed Rank’s drive to make 
employees aware of all the opportunities  
and support mechanisms it has put in  
place in this regard.

Reward  
and talent 
strategy

Rank’s reward strategy 

The following reward strategies are currently 
underway at Rank which support the 
Group’s commitment to gender diversity as 
well as improving engagement and retention 
more widely across the Group.

•  Periodic pay and benefits audits;
•   Benchmarking reviews in addition to 

calculating grade and market comparison 
ratios for individuals during the annual 
pay review cycle;

•   Evaluation of job roles and pay grades  

to ensure a fair structure; and

•   Group-wide calibration of annual pay 

proposals to provide a sense check  
and challenge as needed on issues of 
equity, whether gender related or for  
other concerns. 

 
Rank’s talent strategy

To address the gender imbalance as 
employees progress up Rank’s management 
structure, we have several initiatives to 
support senior women and their careers.

Family support policies 

We have a variety of family support policies 
including Flexible Working which seeks  
to enhance the working lives of employees 
by offering alternative working patterns to 
help them strike a balance between their 
work and personal commitments. Flexible 
working may include variations to hours  
of work, working from home or job shares, 
all of which can help support work-life 
balance. With its policy on Time Off for 
Dependants Rank also recognises that 
employees with family responsibilities 
sometimes have conflicting demands 
between family life and work responsibilities, 
and the provision of time off for emergency 
situations involving dependants helps 
colleagues manage clashing and stressful 
claims on their time and attention.

Rank also provides related benefits such 
as a Childcare Voucher Scheme, to help 
employees save on the cost of registered 
childcare, and now promotes the 

Government’s Tax Free Childcare scheme 
which launched in April 2017. Rank also 
launched a holiday purchase scheme in 
2018, offering employees the opportunity  
to buy up to 10 days of additional holiday  
in the year, providing a benefit to support  
a better work/life balance by enabling them 
to take additional time off. 

Maternity pay 

To support, retain and help women advance 
into senior positions, we now offer enhanced 
Company Maternity and Adoption Pay. 
This offers 26 weeks’ full pay at the outset 
of these periods of leave for women in 
senior roles or our ‘pathway’ positions into 
senior management.

Coaching and mentoring 

Rank runs a coaching and mentoring 
scheme, where high potential employees – 
many of them women – can access support 
and guidance from senior colleagues. This 
provides opportunities for professional and 
personal development as well as promoting 
networking across the Group. Rank 
understands the value that sponsorship of its 
female talent can bring to their development 
and career progression. Therefore the 
executive committee have all individually 
committed to the sponsorship of two females 
within the businesses and a third party will 
be appointed to support the scheme.

External resources 

Rank is delighted to be partner with  
The EveryWoman Network, whose goal  
is to ensure future generations of business 
women have every opportunity to fulfil  
their potential and reach the very top of 
their organisations. 

It provides workbooks, webinars, articles 
and videos on a wide range of development 
topics including:

•  Developing leadership behaviours;
•  Executive presence;
•  Managing upward with success;
•  Promoting yourself; and
•  Career planning.

As part of Rank’s diversity and  
inclusion strategy, we are looking to  
extend similar support to other minority 
groups within Rank.

Training support  

Across the Group, Rank recently introduced 
a new talent assessment process, internally 
referred to as BeTalent. This approach uses 
objective criteria to identify and select 
talent so as to limit the impact of conscious 
and unconscious bias. Furthermore, those 
identified as high potential, receive a 
bespoke development plan to facilitate their 
ongoing career development using internal 
and external sources.

Rank provides comprehensive training 
to employees across the business with a 
particular focus on the senior population 
and high-performing individuals, many of 
which are female.

Rank also provides sponsorship and support 
enabling eligible employees to study for 
professional qualifications, enhancing 
their technical expertise and professional 
standing in functions such as Accountancy, 
Purchasing, HR and Marketing. This 
provision includes the subsidy of course fees 
and materials, professional membership fees/
subscriptions and paid study leave.

None of these initiatives will, of itself, 
remove the gender pay gap - and it may be 
several years before some have any impact 
at all. In the meantime, Rank is committed 
to reporting on an annual basis on what it is 
doing to reduce the gender pay gap and the 
progress that it is making.

What more 
can rank do?

Understand trends 
Rank will undertake an evidence-gathering exercise to include 
qualitative data. It will do this through a review across all areas and 
levels of the organisation to identify the barriers (and the drivers) for 
women employees, covering areas such as: 

•   The proportion of men and women applying for jobs and 

being recruited;

•   The proportion of men and women applying for and 

obtaining promotions;

•   The proportion of men and women leaving the organisation  

and their reasons for leaving;

•   The number of men and women in each role and pay band;

•   Take-up of flexible working arrangements by gender and level 

within the organisation;

•   The proportion of men and women who return to their original  

job after a period of maternity or other parental leave; and

•   The proportion of men and women still in post a year on from a 
return to work after a period of maternity or other parental leave.

The results of this evidence gathering exercise will determine the 
further steps Rank will take to promote gender diversity in all areas  
of its workforce.

Recruitment
Rank is reviewing the language it uses in its recruitment process, 
from its job descriptions through to how jobs are advertised, with 
the aim to ensure they are all gender neutral. In addition Rank has 
committed to ensuring at least one female is on the shortlist for all 
senior appointments. 
 
Other commitments
Rank also recently identified the need for unconscious bias training  
for all of its leaders within the business. This training commenced  
in March 2018. 
Rank recently signed up to PwC’s Diversity in the Hospitality,  
Travel and Leisure Charter which requires Rank’s leaders to sign up 
to ten diversity commitments. Over the coming months Rank will be 
looking at how these commitments can be further embedded within 
the Group.
