From April 2017, all large UK companies employing 250 people or more are 
required to report the following gender pay gap figures: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As a significant manufacturing business in the UK, Ardagh welcomes this 
step. We believe that it is important for all companies to be transparent about 
pay, and that by doing this, progress will be made in bridging the gender pay 
gap that exists in the UK today.
The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay ensures that 
men and women at Ardagh Group receive the same pay for carrying out the 
same or equivalent work. The gender pay gap is an average figure for all 
employees within each Ardagh employing entity’s GB workforce, regardless 
of their role or seniority.
Within the UK, Ardagh is split into three separate employing entities for each 
of which we have reported the gender pay gap figures in this report:
 
 
 
As a manufacturing business, in our factories within Glass, Metal Packaging 
and Metal Beverage, the balance of the workforce is male dominated and 
has  been  for  a  large  number  of  years.  This  means  our  gender  balance 
is uneven. In addition, the overall reward package offered to our staff is 

1.   Ardagh Glass
2.  Ardagh Metal Packaging
3.  Ardagh Metal Beverage

extremely competitive which means that our attrition rates are extremely 
low. This in turn means that in some areas of the business it may take more 
time to address this gender imbalance. The picture is different in our office 
environments as these types of working environments tend to attract both 
men and women. 
Our gender pay gap variations across our different entities are influenced 
on  the  one  hand  by  the  proportionately  larger  number  of  men  in  senior 
roles and proportionately more women in support administrative functions 
which is still typical of manufacturing in the UK. On the other hand, we also 
proportionately have good representation of women in our top quartiles in 
our director roles and proportionately more men in the technical roles within 
our factories. The result is that whereas we have a high gender pay and 
bonus pay gap in some business areas, we also have a high negative bonus 
gap in other areas.
People are fundamental to our success and our strategy within the Ardagh 
Group  in  Europe  is  to  embrace  diversity  and  create  opportunities  that 
encourage  women,  younger  people  and  all  backgrounds  to  join  Ardagh 
Group and be part of this innovative and progressive organisation.   
We  confirm  that  the  information  in  this  report  is  accurate  and  prepared 
in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017.
