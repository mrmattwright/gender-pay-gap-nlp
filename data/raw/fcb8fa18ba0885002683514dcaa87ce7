SUMMARY

We are confident that our gender pay gap does not reflect an equal pay issue.  We have a gender pay 
gap because we employ three times as many men as women.  This is not unusual for companies, such 
as Teledyne Ltd,  in the  engineering and manufacturing sector operating predominately in the 
aerospace, defence and oil and gas industries.  The number of women employed in these industries is 
typically less than men, therefore this has an impact on the gender balance within the company.  

Within the upper 3 quartiles there is a pay gap in favour of men.  This is caused by the fact that more 
men are employed by the company in these quartiles, which is typical of the industries in which 
Teledyne Ltd operate.  Within the lower quartile the pay gap favours females.  This is due to the roles 
undertaken by females being predominantly administrative and roles undertaken by males being 
mainly shop floor activities.

We regularly review our policies, processes and practices to ensure that they are free from bias and 
inclusive to all employees.  We continue to focus on a number of activities and initiatives to actively 
increase female representation and progression within our company.  We actively advertise all 
vacancies and recruit the best possible candidate for the role, which reflects our corporate ethics 
policy.

We confirm the data reported is accurate.

42% of Men have received a bonus while 50% of women have received a bonus
showing an 8% favour for women.

Teledyne e2v is reporting its Gender Pay Gap separately.  In  future years as Teledyne e2v integrates further into the Teledyne group, we may combine our narratives.  In  the meantime you can view 
the 2017 Teledyne e2v report on www.e2v.com.

The method for calculating the gender pay gap figures has been outlined by the UK Government as per the guidelines which can be found here:- www.gov.uk/guidance/gender-pay-gap-reporting-
