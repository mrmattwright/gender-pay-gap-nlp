2017  
Gender Pay Gap  
Report

Tulip Ltd is one of the UK’s leading food companies  
and Britain’s number one pig producer, operating 17 
sites and hundreds of farms across the country.
We have a dedicated workforce of more than 6,000 
permanent employees and we are among the largest 
employers in the communities in which we are based. 
We consider our people to be our family - and family  
is very much at the heart of our world.
As an employer, we are required by law to carry  
out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act  
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  
You will find this information on the following pages.
I am pleased to report that the gender pay gap  
within Tulip is significantly lower that both the UK 
national average (as calculated by the Office for 
National Statistics) and the UK manufacturing  
industry average (as calculated by Payscale).
The majority of roles within our business are  
based in our food manufacturing sites and the teams 
are paid the same rate according to their job role,  
with no differences between men and women.

The 2016/17 fiscal year has been one of great change 
for Tulip Ltd, with a new CEO, a new Executive Team 
and a new business structure all being put into place. 
The business has also invested in attracting new talent, 
with around 50% of the top 60 directors and managers 
within Tulip Ltd new to the company during that period. 
Of these, more than a third of the roles have been filled 
by females.
Within Tulip Ltd, a bonus scheme is in place and,  
even though more men than women received a bonus, 
some of the higher payments were made to women in 
key roles, which resulted in a positive pay gender gap 
for mean bonus. 
In all quartiles more men are employed than women. 
The top quartiles do show a higher percentage of male 
employees, however, we have appointed a number of 
women into senior roles over the last few months.
With the help of our internal talent management 
strategies, we are committed to addressing any gap  
in gender pay across all levels of our business.

Next steps

While we are proud to be well ahead of the national 
and industry average, there still remains a gender pay 
gap within the business.

Our plans to address this include:

1

2

Continuing to review 

recruitment and retention 
strategies to ensure they 
focus on attracting the best 

talent into key areas.

Looking at where  

we advertise our roles  
to attract the best female 
talent including getting 
balanced gender lists  

from agencies.

3

Reviewing and  
actively promoting 

established policies of 
flexible working and 
shared parental leave.

As a leader in our industry, we believe we  
have a responsibility to set an example and  
show true leadership in addressing issues which 
have no place in today’s society, whether it be 
gender pay gap, modern slavery or simply  
ensuring Tulip is seen as a good employer  
which embraces diversity.
We are continuously exploring new ways 
to attract and retain the best people from a 
varied and diverse community and will ensure 
that opportunities are available for all based on 
aptitude and ability to continue to make sure 
Tulip is a great place to work.

The data in this document is accurate and has been calculated using the mechanisms set out in the gender pay gap legislation and reporting regulations and has been internally verified.
