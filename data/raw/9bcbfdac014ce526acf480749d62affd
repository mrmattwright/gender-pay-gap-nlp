Gender Pay Gap Report   

The Gender Pay Gap Reporting (GPGR) data for the qualifying BCA Marketplace plc 
subsidiaries, as required by the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 
2017, is set out below.  
 
The legislation sets out how gender pay gap information should be reported and the calculations that 
need to be made. Companies with 250 employees or more are required to publish a gender pay gap 
report. Seven of BCA Marketplace plc’s subsidiaries meet the size requirements of the regulations and 
this document contains the reporting for them (British Car Auctions Limited, BCA Logistics Limited, 
WeBuyAnyCar Limited, Walon Limited, Paragon Fleet Solutions Limited, BCA Fleet Solutions Limited, and 
BCA Vehicle Services Limited).  
 
The following statistics outline the mean and median gender pay gaps based on hourly rates of pay as at 
the snapshot date of 5 April 2017. Also provided are the mean and median differences between 
bonuses paid to men and women in the reportable companies in the year to 5 April 2017, and the 
relative proportion of men and women who receive bonuses.  
 
The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings 
across an organisation, regardless of their role or seniority. It is not the same as equal pay, as the 
gender pay gap does not show differences in pay for comparable jobs.

Walon Limited employs a high proportion of men in its workforce, the majority of whom are employed 
as vehicle transporter drivers and who represent the higher paid individuals within the company. We 
currently employ one female truck driver within the fleet. This leads to a higher than average gender 
pay gap when compared with the UK national average. Walon Limited’s low rate of female truck drivers 
is consistent with the UK national numbers, where less than 1% of registered drivers are female.   
 
In addition, transporter drivers receive productivity target payments and other performance related pay 
as part of their remuneration. This is accounted for as a bonus payment under the Gender Pay Gap 
Reporting requirements, resulting in a much higher proportion of men receiving bonuses than women 
on this measure.
