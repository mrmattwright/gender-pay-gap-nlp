 
 
Edmundson Electrical Ltd Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2017 
 
 
UK employers are now required under new legislation to report six key figures relating to their gender pay gap: 
 

1.  The mean hourly pay gap between men and women, 
2.  The median hourly pay gap between men and women, 
3.  The mean bonus pay gap between men and women, 
4.  The median bonus pay gap between men and women, 
5.  The proportion of men and women receiving bonus pay and 
6.  The distribution of men and women within pay band quartiles. 

 
 
Gender pay versus equal pay 
 
The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women across a whole organisation. This is not the 
same as equal pay. Equal pay deals with pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work 
of equal value. The factors influencing the gender pay gap include the distribution of men and women between grades, experience, 
tenure and geographic location.

What impacts the pay and bonus gaps at Edmundson Electrical? 

The main cause of our mean and median pay gaps in favour of men is the demographic profile of our workforce, which has a numerical 
under-representation  of  women  across  the  business,  including  in  the  most  senior  roles.  This  is  reflective  of  the  distribution  and 
construction sectors in general, which typically employ more men than women. 

Our bonus pay gap is impacted by the relative seniority of  men and women within Edmundson Electrical Ltd. While a very similar 
proportion of men and women receive a bonus, the seniority of employees affects the amount of bonus awarded. We are confident 
that both the bonus eligibility criteria and the basis on which they are awarded are fair and non-discriminatory.  

 

Edmundson  Electrical  Ltd  welcomes  the  new  reporting  requirements  and  is  committed  to  providing  equal  opportunities  at  work 
regardless of gender.
