The Schaeffler Group’s Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the “Global Compact”, “The Global Sullivan Principles of Corporate Social Responsibility” and the standards of “Social Accountability International”. The basic principles described here constitute a minimum standard for us and do not affect country-specific additions that are based on the relevant cultural circumstances.  Human rights We undertake to observe the internationally proclaimed human rights in our sphere of influence.  Forced labor We will not engage in or associate ourselves with use of any form of forced labor.  Child labor We will not engage in or associate ourselves with use of child labor in our operations.  Discrimination and respect of others We mean to provide a workplace free of discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender, race, skin color, religious beliefs, age, national origin, handicap, or sexual orientation. Employees in our workplace deserve each other’s respect.  Compensation and working hours We recognize workers’ needs for adequate remuneration and observe the legally guaranteed minimum wages in the respective labor market. We observe the rules that apply to working hours in each of our operations.  Relationship with employees and employee representatives We believe in an Open Door Policy and enable our employees to express their interests directly to management on a continual basis.  Reconcilability of job and family We are a family-owned enterprise. With our family-friendly arrangements and provisions we strive to enhance the satisfaction and motivation of our employees and hence increase the performance of the Group.  Health and safety We mean to provide a safe and healthy working environment that meets or exceeds applicable standards for occupational health and safety. We will take steps to prevent injuries and occupational illnesses caused by workplace conditions.  Workforce development We see the development of our employees as an essential investment in the future of our company. We also value the development of social and technical expertise.  Environmental responsibility We maintain an environmental management system at all production sites world-wide, which we continuously improve. Local environmental protection laws and the specifications of the Schaeffler Group’s environmental protection system must be observed as a minimum. We collaborate with our business partners and suppliers in exercising our environmental responsibility.  Conflict of interests, gifts and attempted bribery We give an undertaking that we will not accept gifts or payments or hold (company) investments which could lead to a conflict of interests. In particular, neither bribes nor any other illegal payments may be offered, made or accepted.  Suppliers We encourage, where practicable, our suppliers to introduce and implement similar principles of social responsibility within their companies.  Responsibility We believe each of our employees has an individual responsibility to follow this Code of Conduct and encourage coworkers to abide by it as well. Management is responsible for enforcing principles that become part of our rules or policies.                                 © Schaeffler (UK) Ltd 2018        Print page  Top of page                 Schaeffler applies cookies to secure an optimal use.
