Swiss Re – UK Gender Pay Gap Statement 2017

At Swiss Re we embrace a diverse and multi-generational workforce that brings an 
enriching mix of differences in age, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, gender expression, religious beliefs, physical abilities, 
cultural background, education and work experiences. 

Gender diversity, including gender pay equality, is therefore both a moral and 
strategic imperative at Swiss Re. 

What is the gender pay gap calculation?

From April 2018, all U.K. companies with over 250 employees are required to 
publish their gender pay gap data by the U.K. government. 

The gender pay gap calculation requires companies to measure the average 
earnings of all male and female employees, regardless of role, seniority and working 
hours, and show the percentage difference between the two.  

These gender pay gap figures compare the general pay and bonus conditions of men 
and women in the business. They do not provide an insight into the equality of pay 
between a man and woman doing similar jobs. It is unlawful to pay people unequally 
based on their gender.

What is Swiss Re’s gender pay gap for 2017?

Using the government’s calculation, excluding ReAssure which reports separately, 
our gender pay gap is 42% across Swiss Re U.K. entities when using the median 
(middle) value, and 39% when using the mean (average) value. This compares to a 
Financial Services sector median of 35.6% and mean of 35.1%, and a UK median of 
18.4% and a mean of 17.4%1.

Services Limited, Swiss Re Management Limited UK, Swiss Re Corporate Solutions

ReAssure. Whilst Corporate Solutions and Life Capital are included in the aggregate 
Swiss Re All UK numbers, they are not reported separately given the number of 
employees in these entities fall below the legal threshold of 250 and recognising the 
small numbers make reporting difficult and risk confidentiality issues at an individual 
level.

There is no evidence that we have an issue when it comes to equal pay for equal 
work (a statistical analysis conducted by a leading consultancy who specialises in 
Equal Pay does not indicate a statistically significant risk of gender bias). 

Our numbers reflect the lack of women in senior leadership roles which is clearly not 
where it should be. We are dissatisfied with these results. The ReAssure gender pay 
gap calculations are lower than Swiss Re, although again we recognise they are still 
not where we would expect them to be. Our aim at Swiss Re is to address the issue 
of gender representation which is not just about improving the promotion of women 
in our company but also about attracting them in greater numbers and retaining 
them for longer. Although a diverse, inclusive and meritocratic workplace is core to 
our beliefs, we have not yet made sufficient progress and we recognise that we need 
to accelerate the pace of change and are committed to doing so. 

Why do we have a gender pay gap?

At Swiss Re, along with a majority of the Financial Services sector, the main reason 
this analysis shows a gender pay gap is because there are more men than women in 
senior positions. When we combine all levels together and rank the pay of our 
colleagues into four quartiles, we see that there are proportionally more men than 
women in the two highest paid quartiles.

We know that we need to do more to increase and retain women in senior positions 
at Swiss Re which will help address our reported gender pay gap.

What is our bonus pay gap?

At Swiss Re we believe that people should be rewarded fairly for their contribution to 
our collective success. Therefore bonus payments are an important element of our 
total reward offering. 

Combining all positions and levels together, the bonus pay gap between men and 
women is a median of 58% and a mean of 68%. This difference is again a reflection 
of the fact that currently we have significantly more men than women in senior 
positions where bonuses are proportionately larger.

Again, we accept that we need to do more to increase and retain women in senior 
positions at Swiss Re which will help address our reported bonus pay gap.

What are we doing to close the gender pay gap?

At Swiss Re, we are working hard to increase the number of women in leadership 
roles and know we need to do more. We have a number of actions already in place to 
support and advance women in our business. However the full impact may take 
some time to be realised. 

We are actively engaged with trying to solve this complex global issue. Our 
approach is constantly evaluated and adjusted in order to ensure it is as effective as 
possible. We are committed to the following on-going initiatives:

 ̤ Diversity and inclusion, and gender diversity in particular, is a key strategic 
priority for the company’s senior management, both globally and in the U.K.

 ̤ Our Group Executive Committee sent a clear message about their commitment 
and the need to accelerate progress at Swiss Re on International Women’s Day 
March 8th. Across the world, “Gender Intelligence Dialogues” were held by 
business leaders to constructively discuss research on gender differences and the 
value revealed when we embrace those differences instead of ignoring them. 

 ̤ We’re accelerating the advancement of our internal female talent by making sure 

that women and men are equally equipped and encouraged to go for the most 
senior roles. In 2017, we launched Swiss Re’s first global Female Sponsorship 
initiative, which matched talented females with influential senior executives who 
act as sponsors to help them reach their career aspirations. For some time, we 
have ensured that the gender mix in our leadership development programs reflect 
an equal proportion of the male and female workforce. In 2018, we plan to reach 
out to the female workforce to understand why less of them apply for 
advancement opportunities to the same extent as men, and engage them in 
practical solutions. 

 ̤ Swiss Re recognises that different people in different roles have different needs 

and preferences when it comes to their working patterns. Our market leading 
‘Own The Way You Work’ approach gives employees autonomy to decide how, 
when and where they carry out tasks to motivate and engage high performance

teams. We are proud that this was recognised in Glassdoor’s 2017 Top 20 for 
Employee Benefits & Perks and we believe it will help attract and retain diverse 
candidates and colleagues.

 ̤ We’re committed to accommodating informal and formal flexible work 

arrangements in line with business requirements. Flexible working for women 
and men of all levels is key to improve the gender pay gap as it gives people – 
particularly those with child and elderly care requirements – more options around 
working hours. 

 ̤ The internal equality network, ‘Open Doors’ was launched in 2017 in the 
UK. The aim of Open Doors is for Swiss Re to be recognised as an employer that 
promotes gender equality, and facilitates an environment where people want to 
work and thrive. In line with the Group’s mission to make the world more resilient, 
Open Doors fosters an inclusive culture where everyone becomes more resilient - 
understanding and tackling day-to-day issues with colleagues, clients and society.

 ̤ We’re also focused on increasing the number of women joining Swiss Re at 
all levels. Wherever possible we strive for diverse hiring slates and ensure that 
there are both men and women involved in the interview process to ensure a 
diverse selection panel. 

 ̤ This year we have launched Textio, a self-service online tool which reviews job 

descriptions and advises on gender-neutral wording.

 ̤ Unconscious bias awareness has been a key pillar of our D&I strategy for some 

time. While it is important, we’ve learned that on its own it does not improve 
outcomes. Therefore, we have taken this to the next level by embedding best 
practice approaches into our talent management processes, and 
implemented a new workshop for people managers that brings the learning into 
practice with relevant exercises.

 ̤ Our compensation teams give important guidance and direction to HR Partners 

and relevant Line Managers, emphasising the need for pay equality. The results 
of the Annual Compensation Review are shared with the Group Executive 
Committee, who are committed to ensuring that a fair and equal approach has 
been followed. Furthermore we are systemically assessing pay equity across the 
Group with an external consultant.

Diversity and Inclusion at Swiss Re

Research shows that diversity and an inclusive culture are key determinants in the 
ability of teams (and therefore businesses) to make balanced decisions, navigate 
uncertainty and innovate successfully. 

At Swiss Re we embrace a diverse workforce that brings an enriching mix of 
differences and is therefore both a strategic and moral imperative at Swiss Re. 

We know we have more to do and we are committed to accelerating the pace of 
change.

The information provided in this written statement is accurate and meets the 
requirements of the Gender Pay Gap reporting regulations.
