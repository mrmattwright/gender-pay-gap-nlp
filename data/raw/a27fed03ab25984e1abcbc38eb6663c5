Our community of team members, customers, partners and suppliers makes us who we are and it’s the strength of this community that will keep us at the forefront.  Every day we strive to create a culture and environment that puts people first, that’s inclusive, fair, and as our company purpose states, where ‘everyone is welcome’. We know we are not perfect, however we are fully committed to supporting all our team members achieve their goals and ambitions.  It’s important for us to challenge ourselves every day, and our gender pay gap results show that while we are below the UK average, there is more we can, should, and will be doing to encourage and enable opportunities for all our team members.
