The Grimsby Institute Group is a forward thinking organisation that prides itself for putting its people, both staff and students at the heart of everything we do. All of our activities in relation to teaching, safeguarding, training, recruitment, retention and progression are core business areas where we must be mindful of the diverse needs of those we work with. Although the law no longer requires public sector organisations to produce equality schemes, the Grimsby Institute Group has produced an Equality Statement, which is more than mere words, but a statement of our intent.  This statement underpinned by declarations from the leaders of the Grimsby Institute Group include many actions we believe will proactively eliminate all forms of discrimination where they exist and prevent them from occurring in the first instance. Equality Intent turning into equality action is the future ethos and philosophy of the Grimsby Institute Group and as the principal lead for Equality, Diversity Inclusion & Human Rights the Grimsby Institute Group will demonstrate this commitment in all that they do.
