On April 2017, Facebook's UK gender pay gap is 0.84% and median gender pay gap is 9.92%. This compares with the 2017 Office of National Statistics UK national mean of 17.4% and national median of 18.4%. Average bonuses for women at Facebook were 39.8% lower than men and 41.5% lower at the median.  The reason for our gender pay gap is unequal representation. Like many other companies in our industry, we have more men than women working at Facebook. This is particularly evident in our large engineering workforce, which represents over half of our 1,500 employees in the UK, and across our senior leadership positions. Technical roles also tend to drive higher market rates of pay, both in terms of salary and total compensation, due to the demand for specialised skills.  Gender pay is different to equal pay. At Facebook, women and men receive equal pay for equal work and have done so for many years. This is an absolute minimum standard for a diverse business such as ours and we continually review our hiring and compensation practices to ensure this remains the case.  Compensation at Facebook is made up of base salary, cash bonus or commission, and equity in the company. We work hard to avoid unconscious bias affecting how much people get paid. Managers don't make decisions about compensation increases - instead we use a formulaic approach that determines pay based on performance and level.  In order to decrease the gender pay gap, we are working to increase representation of women in technical and leadership roles across the company. We have a strong belief in recruiting and retaining a diverse team, and in creating the culture of respect and inclusion needed for people to do their best work. By the end of 2018 we will have created 800 new jobs in the UK and with our Diverse Slate Approach we work to include at least one underrepresented person when interviewed onsite.  Opportunities for advancement and leadership within the company are also crucial. For our women, we run a series of development workshops and training programs designed to provide a strong network of support, along with the tools they need to be the best leaders they can be across different levels in the company.  We hold ourselves accountable because this matters to us. In 2017, the number of women employees globally rose from 33% to 35% and the number of women in technical roles increased from 17% to 19%. Between 2014 when we first publicly reported our representation data and 2017, the number of women in leadership roles has increased from 23% to 28%.  We want our workforce to reflect the diversity of our global community of over 2 billion people on Facebook, so it’s vital for us to have a broad range of perspectives from different genders, races, ages, religions, sexual orientations, abilities and many other characteristics.  We are committed to increasing the representation of women at all levels. We know we're not where we need to be, and we're committed to making real progress.
