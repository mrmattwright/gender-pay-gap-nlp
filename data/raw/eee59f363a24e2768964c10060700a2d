UK GENDER  
PAY GAP 
REPORT 2018

INTRODUCTION

Under the UK Government’s new Gender Pay Gap Regulations, 
all UK legal entities with over 250 employees are required to 
share details of their gender balance and pay. They are also 
required to give the percentage of men and women receiving 
a bonus, and the proportions of men and women in each pay 
quartile of the workforce.

Coty UK is now sharing these results with you. They give a 
snapshot of the UK organisation, taken on April 5th 2017, just six 
months following the launch of the new Coty. We are reporting 
on five individual legal entities as required by the Government, 
but also giving an overview for the whole of the UK.

The report covers the statutory requirements, but more 
importantly, shares with you the philosophy that is driving 
our employee proposition and our aim to ensure that every 
individual in Coty can develop their full potential. It is an 
approach that applies to everyone in the UK – and across Coty 
as a whole – and reaches far wider than gender balance alone.

Our purpose is to celebrate and liberate the diversity of your 
beauty, and we know that delivering this in the world starts 
with living it ourselves. Every one of us here at Coty is an 
individual with unique background, strengths, experiences and 
perspectives. We need to embrace each other’s differences, 
whether they are differences in beauty; in cultures; in style… 
embracing them makes our organization – and all of us –  
richer, and better serves our diverse consumers.

We stand for radical inclusion, looking to go beyond industry 
standards to create a culture in which everyone can bring their 
whole self to work. This is our choice as a business, and one 
we believe will help us achieve our ambitious mission of being 
a challenger in beauty. This is how we will ensure we live the 
value of Being Brave and Going Beyond. We need everyone to 
be empowered to do their best work, and that comes from 
recognizing and valuing their differences and perspectives.

UK GENDER PAY  GAP REPORT 2018UK GENDER  
BALANCE AND PAY

We are in a reasonably balanced position on gender diversity, 
with the proportion of women in our total UK workforce 
standing at 56%, and men at 44%. and we have an even  
split of employees between male and female in the  
Upper Pay quartile*. In the Upper Middle quartile*, 54%  
of the workforce is female. About 290 individuals in the 
highest pay quartile are women.

The level of female representation diminishes the higher up 
the organization you progress. However, we are beginning to 
see a small rebalance in the UK, with 75% of our most senior 
level appointments being made to women over the past 12 
months. We have also seen a rise in the overall proportion of 
women holding these senior roles, to 42%. 

With such a balanced representation of women in the 
Upper and Upper Middle Pay quartiles*, we have a strong 
pipeline of women who we expect can progress into the 
highest levels of the company.

COTY’S PAY 
QUARTILES IN THE UK*

In the Lower Middle quartile* our split is 55% - 45% men to 
women, whilst in the lower quartile*, women outnumber men 
by 72% to 28%. While not balanced, this is not surprising, as 
many of the roles in this quartile are beauty consultants and 
make-up artists – roles that are more frequently taken by 
women – and not an unusual situation for the beauty and 
retail sectors. Nonetheless, we would like to see more males 
represented here, as we want to see a world of beauty that 
values individuality of all genders.

The pay quartiles are calculated by taking a listing of the 
hourly pay rate of all the organization’s full-pay relevant 
employees in the pay period that covers the snapshot date. 
Divide this list into four quartiles, with an equal number 
of employees in each section. From highest paid to lowest 
paid, these quartiles will be the upper quartile, upper middle 
quartile, lower middle quartile, and lower quartile. For Coty, 
this is 582 employees per quartile.

UK GENDER  
PAY GAP

A gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in the 
average pay of men and women – regardless of the nature 
of their work – across an entire organization, business sector, 
industry, or the economy as a whole. It is a complex issue and 
can be driven by many different factors, including the lack 
of gender balance in any section of a company. It is different 
from an equal pay comparison, which would involve direct 
comparison of two people or groups of people carrying out 
the same, similar or equivalent work.

 
Coty in the UK has a median* pay gap of 9.3%,  
which is in line with the retail sector at 9%**, and 
significantly better than the UK as a whole  
at 18.4%**

The mean* pay gap is 21.2%, a little higher than  
both the retail sector, at 16%, and the figure for  
the UK, at 17.4%.

Bonus gender pay gap

The bonus pay gap is based on bonus payments made to 
all relevant employees in the 12 months leading up to the 
snapshot date. 

Coty in the UK has a mean* bonus gender pay gap 
of 62.3% and a median* bonus gender pay gap of 
40.2%. The proportion of women and men receiving 
bonus pay is 28% and 12% respectively.

The shape of the organization is a key factor in these 
results, as Coty has a high proportion of positions held 
by women in the lower pay quartile – a similar profile to 
many organizations operating in the retail sector.

There are two main influencers driving these results: the first 
is the large number of positions held by women working in the 
lower pay quartile, where their bonus (commission) payment is

quartiles. The second is the fact that, although there is 
an equal number of men and women overall in the upper 
pay quartile, there are more men than women at the most 
senior level who qualify for the highest bonus awards. 

The percentage levels of employees receiving bonus 
payments is influenced by the fact that around one third 
of colleagues working in our Supply Chain business do not 
receive a bonus. Many employees remain on protected 
terms and conditions as a result of the merger. 

*Median Pay Gap

This represents the middle point of a population. If you lined up all 
of the women at a company and all of the men, the median pay 
gap is the difference between the hourly rate of pay for the middle 
woman, compared to the hourly rate of pay for the middle man.

*Mean Pay Gap
If we add together all the hourly rates of male colleagues and 
calculate the average and do the same for female colleagues, the 
mean pay gap (as a percentage) is the difference in pay between 
the average male and female hourly rate.

MAKING COTY A 
MORE AMAZING 
PLACE TO WORK 

This year we will be able to focus more on supporting 
our employees in their journey at Coty. As one of our 
biggest priorities, we’re investing in development, career 
journeys, and helping everyone better manage the 
intensity that comes with creating a new company. We 
know that in the past months we have had so much to 
do to stabilize the business that we didn’t have much 
opportunity to prioritize or support enough what is our 
greatest strength – our employees. 

Our aim is to ensure that every individual working for 
Coty can fulfil their true potential and bring their own 
self to work. Addressing our gender balance and pay will 
contribute to Coty’s commitment to radical inclusion.

What Coty wants to be known for…

We want to be known as a company that celebrates 
individual differences and values inclusion, and Coty’s 
leadership welcomes a diverse range of people and 
perspectives within the business. 

“Whatever difference you 
bring, however radical your 
perspective, there’s a place  
for you at Coty.”

“I like that the team is very 
open with different cultural 
aspects; the whole team is 
willing to listen.”

-   G r a c e         S t e p h a n i e         A l b e r t o         E m i l y

Work is well advanced to establish our employee 
proposition. We have asked our employees for their views 
via our annual engagement survey, our social intranet 
- workplace, face-to-face interviews and workshops, to 
really understand the experience of Coty through the 
eyes of employees and what makes it a distinctive and 
enjoyable place to work. 

Radical inclusion and diversity strategy 

We have started work on our internal radical inclusion 
and diversity strategy and have created an internal, 
multifunctional steering group, which is in the process of 
developing a roadmap for the organization. 

Diversity was a consistent employee theme and 
the research suggests that this reflects a current 
organizational strength, with 79% of employees  
agreeing that “differing opinions are openly discussed 
when making decisions in my team”; a score that is 
significantly above the industry average.

The group is under the sponsorship of two executive 
committee members – Sébastien Froidefond, Chief Human 
Resources Officer and Sylvie Moreau, President, Coty 
Professional Beauty, and the topic is discussed at the 
Executive Committee. The topics will be reported via the 
Responsible Growth Steering Group annually to the Board.

UK GENDER PAY  GAP REPORT 2018The mean bonus pay gap is calculated by adding together the bonus payments made in each gender group and then dividing that by the number of relevant employees in that group. The median bonus pay gap is calculated by ranging the bonus payments from high to low, and the one that is in the middle is  the median bonus pay figure. ** Source: Gender Pay Gap figures for UK and Retail sector:  Office of National StatisticsOur roadmap includes:

WE STAND FOR YOU

In February 2018 we launched our partnership with Global 
Citizen to harness the power of our collective voice for 
large-scale social change. Powered by Global Citizen’s 
technology, our digital social platform is pioneering a new 
form of employee activism – the first of its kind. We’re 
taking a stand against prejudice and discrimination based 
on gender, sexual orientation, disability and ethnicity, 
starting with a focus on gender equality. 

The impact of the program is also internal. If our employees 
better understand the issues, it can help us become a more 
inclusive business and live the values we want to see in society. 

 
 
 
On launch day, February 26th, employees across Coty ‘stood 
up’ and shared their commitment on our social intranet. 
We are now setting up advisory groups to guide local 
communications and awareness, and to champion this new 
form of employee social engagement. 

“I signed up online and started my contribution 
to being a voice for others #WeStandForYou. 

Would love to do more, too.”

We have just launched Lean In circles in the UK, beginning 
in our Wimbledon office. This group will bring together Coty 
UK women and men in informal or social gatherings for 
us to empower, champion and support women in business 
and their careers. The events will be focused on having 
conversations, sharing knowledge to help one another, and 
also workshops to upskill women in the workplace. 

 “Thank you so much for taking 
the time to LEAN IN. We are 
so appreciative that so many 
of you found the time to join 
us, and we loved the energy, 
passion and engagement in 
all of the sessions.”

LEARNING AND 
DEVELOPMENT

Participants in the Lean In program will be 
able to access free expert videos, discussion guides, 
and tips for women and their male allies. These 
materials are focused on helping women build new 
skills and providing everyone with research-based 
recommendations for advancing gender equality 
at home and at work.

Coty’s own eAcademy was launched last December, 
giving employees access to a learning platform 
that is always on. Learning resources are available 
from our own Coty experts, as well as from some 
of the world’s leading business schools. We want 
to encourage a step change in behaviours, and a 
key section focuses on our culture and values, and 
includes content on a range of diversity topics. In 
the UK, we have also created a video which raises 
awareness of what our Unconscious Biases may be.
