UCAS' corporate strategy  We have updated our strategy, after gathering the views of more than 450 employees, and 1,000 students, schools, colleges, universities, and higher education sector bodies.

The updated strategy sets out our ambition to grow our business to 2020, according to what we are most valued for, and where we know we can offer the most value â€“ helping people progress into higher education.

It received an excellent response from stakeholders across the education sector, with organisations making considered and detailed responses. The  International Admissions Review â€“ Findings and Recommendations report provides a detailed summary of the responses received and outlines proposals for implementation.  Recommendations were broadly supported, with some key priorities emerging:   the capability to upload digital documents  a review of current UCAS deadlines  improving information and advice for international and EU applicants   The consultation responses also emphasised the need for us to enhance our services to all applicants, not just international applicants.  Thank you to everyone who responded or participated in the review. We welcome your continued engagement to ensure any proposals are successful for everyone concerned, particularly applicants. Please email us at international@ucas.ac.uk if you have any questions or comments on the outcome of the International Admissions Review, or if you have any suggestions to support the implementation of any of the proposed recommendations.
