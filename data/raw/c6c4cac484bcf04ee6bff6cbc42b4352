Bonus is split across the team fairly.  We are balanced…  • Our Senior Leadership team represents 53% women and 47% men  • 11% of our female population in the Support Office is part of the Senior Leadership team vs 14% of men  We recruit for talent….  • When we recruit within our retail stores for a Beauty Advisor not only are we looking for amazing artistry skills and a passion for skincare and colour; we are looking to the future. As such, in 2017 60% of our management vacancies were filled internally. This represents an increase of 10% since 2015.  We welcome people back and retain our talent…  • We understand that individuals leave our employment for pastures new, however we also welcome them back! The year preceding the snapshot date, we welcomed back 5% of our employees. As of 5 April 2017, 23% of our employees have over 5 and 10 years service. We have employees in the business with over 20 years service – great considering the business was established 25 years ago!   SUMMARY  • Across the retail landscape there are more females than men that work in the sales and customer service occupation and more that work in a part time capacity. This is true within our business as we have significantly more female employees than male within our store portfolio.  • We have fewer men that are employed with us, however the concentration of their roles are at more senior levels within the business  • We have more female employees within our Support Office functions, however there is more of a balance between men and women than in our stores  • As a result of our brand DNA, in the wonderful world of beauty, many of our applicants and the individuals that we hire are genuinely passionate about the products that we sell and the industry that we work within. This leads us to receiving more interest in employment opportunities from females.  • However we welcome applications from all genders  • We are committed to paying our employees fairly irrespective of what their gender, nationality, religion, race, background or age  • We are an equal opportunities employer           GO Help & Information     Customer Services   Customer Support  Delivery  Returns  Contact Us     Shopping   My Account  My Wish List  Check my Order  Space NK Gift Card  Corporate Gifting  In-Store events  Gifts & Offers  Refer A Friend  New Brands at Space NK     About Us   About Space NK  Store Locator  Inside Space  Careers  Margaret Dabbs x Space NK  Privacy  Terms & Conditions   Site   Site Map          Follow   Facebook  Twitter  Pinterest  YouTube  Instagram  Google         Sign Up To our newsletter      Submit You agree to our terms and conditions Back To Top
