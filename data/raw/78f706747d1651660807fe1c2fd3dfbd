The Organisation  TIMET UK Ltd is the premium supplier of titanium product in the aerospace industry. On 5 th April 2017 the company had 653 employees based across the 2 UK locations at Swansea and Birmingham. The employee demographics in relation to male and female, on the snap shot date, 5 th April 2017, was made up as follows:  Our results  Our results have been calculated in line with the Gender Pay Reporting Regulations which have been set out as follows:   mean gender pay gap in hourly pay  median gender pay gap in hourly pay  mean bonus gender pay gap  median bonus gender pay gap  proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  proportion of males and females in each pay quartile   Our data has been calculated using the pay period that includes the snap shot date for the hourly pay information and the year up to and including the snap shot date for the bonus calculations. Mean Gender Pay gap in hourly pay This is the difference between the mean (average) hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of a female full-pay relevant employee. All employees are included in this calculation.    Median Gender Pay gap in hourly pay This is the difference between the median (middle) hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of a female full-pay relevant employee. All employees are included in this calculation.    The results for both of these are shown below:  Mean Gender Bonus gap This is the difference between the mean (average) bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that of a female relevant employee. All employees are included in this calculation.  Median Gender Bonus gap This is the difference between the median (middle) bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that of a female relevant employee. All employees are included in this calculation.  Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  All employees are included in these calculations.  Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile    This is the proportions of Male and Female relevant employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay band. All employees are included in these calculations.  Lower : the female % in this quartile is higher as we have a number of part time workers that are female.    Lower & Upper Middle: these 2 quartiles are made up of predominantly shift workers.    Upper: there were no females in a Director position and very few in senior manager positions which is reflected in the figures.
