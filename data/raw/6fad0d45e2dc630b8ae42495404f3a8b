Our vision is to see no waste from our sites sent to landfill. We operate from a number of sites in London to provide a safe and secure alternative to landfill disposal. We also operate Reuse and Recycling Centres (RRCs) for household materials. Our regulated facilities are integral to London’s resource-economy; recovering energy from waste — enough to power more than 80,000 homes and businesses in North London, and in doing so, divert more than 698,000* tonnes of waste away from landfill each year, saving approx. 300,000† tonnes of CO2e each year.  †Gross reduction and not net emissions.                         tonnes diverted from landfill       homes & businesses powered       well paid jobs       tonnes CO2e saved last 12 months                        Connect with us         Twitter  Instagram  YouTube  Linkedin  About Us Company Overview  Our Board of Directors  Freedom of information  Suppliers  Privacy Policy  FAQs  Awards  Community Energy  Emission Data  Compost  Free compost  Recycling Centres  Tours  FAQs  Contact Information   LondonEnergy Ltd EcoPark, Advent Way, London N18 3AG, UK    020 8803 1322    enquiries@londonenergyltd.com        LondonEnergy Ltd © 2018.
