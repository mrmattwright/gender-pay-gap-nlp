Gender Pay Gap Report - Plexus Corp. (UK) Ltd.
Plexus’ philosophy is to fairly compensate all employees for their contributions to the Company, with 
a focus on market-based data, relevant experience and performance when setting the compensation 
of individuals.  Our gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the salaries and gender demographics of 
our Engineering community, which accounts for more than a quarter of our UK employees. Engineers 
are predominantly male and their higher salaries relative to other roles significantly increases the 
average pay for our male employees.
