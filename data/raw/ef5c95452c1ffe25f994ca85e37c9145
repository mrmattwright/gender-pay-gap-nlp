We always strive to perform safely, efficiently and compliantly. We are also committed to our corporate social responsibility, to our workforce, local communities and the environment.  Our employees  Without the commitment we have from our employees we would not be able to offer the levels of service and quality that make us an industry leader. So, we continually invest in our people and infrastructure to ensure their health, safety and welfare. We find that this creates a positive and motivated working environment of loyal and long-serving industry experts.  Health and safety  At EMR we are committed to setting industry standards and strive constantly to improve our health and safety performance. A comprehensive annual health and safety plan, the development of staff competence, fresh safety communications, active workforce consultation, and regular performance monitoring, auditing and review all play their part to ensure the controls in place are working, and to identify areas for improvement.  Local communities  We work with local communities on recycling related projects and provide financial support on an individual basis. What’s more, as we grow, we continue to provide “green jobs” for local communities, sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly, by drawing on services from local businesses and suppliers.  The environment  Our core business of metal recycling saves 15 million tonnes of CO2 every year. On top of that, we are continually investing in our facilities, machinery and vehicles to ensure our equipment is up to date and performing efficiently, using the best available technologies and operating to the highest environmental standards. Furthermore, we operate a multi-disciplined environmental consultancy to ensure that not only do we operate to the highest environmental standard, but others can too.  Minimising carbon emissions and waste  Recycling is all about reducing waste, conserving resources and minimising CO2 emissions compared to using virgin ores. The CO2 savings from 10 million tonnes of recycled metals is equivalent to 4.5 million average household carbon emissions.  We also work hard to minimise our own carbon emissions by operating the latest, most energy efficient machinery and by keeping vehicles off the road by using rail and water wherever we can. This reduces the traffic impact on the communities around our facilities.  What’s more, by working with world class technology companies, we are pushing the boundaries of recycling on our quest to become a zero waste company. Through our joint venture with MBA Polymers , we will soon recycle 90% of End-of-Life consumer goods. Next, with the help of our partners Chinook , we will be able to produce more “green energy” than we actually use as a company, through gasification of our residual waste.
