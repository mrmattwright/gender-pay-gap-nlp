At Havas we believe great businesses are built on great 
cultures. We are taking tangible and concrete steps 
to create a genuinely inclusive culture. That means 
providing opportunity for all of our people to succeed. 
We want to be a place where people come to do their 
best work and have the best times of their career. We 
believe the benefits to our business of greater inclusion 
and equality are proven and unequivocal.

Havas UK gender pay gap reportFollowing the Equality Act 2010 (Gender 
Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, all 
UK companies with 250 or more employees 
are required to report their gender pay gap 
information on an annual basis, with effect 
from 5th of April 2017. 

A gender pay gap is the difference between 
the average hourly earnings of all men 
and women in a company across salary 
and bonus. Gender pay gap is not the 
same as equal pay. Equal pay is the legal 
requirement for women and men carrying 
out the same or similar work to be paid 
equally.

HAVAS UK GROUP APRIL 2017 
% OF FEMALES AND MALE EMPLOYEES

Across the Havas Group in the 
UK, our overall team is made up 
of 56% women and 44% men. 
However, as experienced by other 
companies within our sector, there 
are fewer women at the senior 
executive level, where pay and 
bonus are highest and therefore 
Havas Group UK has a gender 
pay gap.

HAVAS UK GROUP 

There are a range of agencies that 
collectively make up the Havas UK Group, 
in total employing around 2,000 people 
throughout the UK. Our approach has 
been to apply this analysis to every Havas 
agency within the UK and report collectively 
as a Group, as well as separately for the 
two legal entities, Creative Lynx Limited 
and Havas Media Limited, who are required 
to report their gender pay gap information 
under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay 
Gap Information) Regulations 2017.

HAVAS UK GROUP APRIL 2017 
% OF FEMALES AND MALES IN EACH OF THE FOUR PAY QUARTILES

male

female

Across the lower, lower middle and upper middle pay quartiles, women have a greater 
representation than men. Where our gender pay gap challenge lies is within the upper pay 
quartile, where the representation of women is 45%, and men 55%, which also explains the 
comparatively larger bonus gap in relation to the salary and bonus gap.

We will continue to actively track our gender pay gap and build on the initiatives we have 
already delivered, in order to change the gender shape of our senior leadership teams.
