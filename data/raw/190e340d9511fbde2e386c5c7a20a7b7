The report covers Edwards Limited entire UK workforce. The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. We regularly review our approach to pay equality through our personal performance development review and salary planning processes, and are confident that we offer equal pay between our male and female populations undertaking comparable work.  The gender pay gap is an average figure for all UK employees regardless of the job that they do. Where there are high ordinary pay differentials by gender, this is for a number of reasons including required skill sets and length of service. Download the full report here.
