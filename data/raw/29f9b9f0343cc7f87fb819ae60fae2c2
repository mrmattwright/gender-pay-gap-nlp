Chief Accounting Officer - Melanie Barker 
 
The  Cardinal  Hume  Academies  Trust  is  an  equal  opportunity  employer  and  committed  to 
diverse  and  inclusive  workplaces.  We  therefore  welcome  the  greater  transparency  that 
gender pay gap reporting promotes.   
We note that our median gender pay gap at 12.3% is in line with the national figure and is less 
than the average median pay gap nationally in other schools and colleges.   However, we are 
not  complacent  and  are  examining  what  we  need  to  do  in  order  to  close  it  further  and 
eliminate bias from any recruitment and/or payment practices.    
The reasons for the gender pay gap both nationally and in education are well-rehearsed.   The 
main reason for our gap is the greater likelihood of a male teacher securing promotion, and 
because the most senior positions in the organisation are occupied by men.   
Although this is changing, the ‘ladder’ structure of teacher pay maintains the gender pay gap 
for  some  years,  going  forwards.  Bonus  payments  are  performance  related  and  almost  all 
relate to those at the most senior levels of the organisation.
