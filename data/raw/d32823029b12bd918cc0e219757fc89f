We are pleased that both of these figures are significantly lower than the national average, and we are working to narrow the gap even further. Commenting on the report, Martin Kersey, HR Director, said: "While it’s encouraging to see that we are in a better position than the national average, we are keen to improve these figures even further. "We have a number of initiatives in place to help promote diversity and to make sure we’re benefitting from everyone in our talent pool. These initiatives include inclusive access to apprenticeships, unconscious bias training for managers and gender diversity requirements for shortlisting senior roles.” Click here to read our 2017 gender pay report At St Andrew’s, we’re committed to inclusion in all its forms. We know that diversity is one of our greatest strengths, contributing positively to our success and, most importantly, to the care we provide for our patients.
