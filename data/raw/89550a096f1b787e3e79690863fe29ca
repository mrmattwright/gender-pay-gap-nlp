OUR 2017 GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

At Burness Paull we aim to be the best Scottish law firm in the world. Our ability to attract, promote and retain women 
is a key part of our commitment to creating a successful, respectful and inclusive workplace for everyone. 
We welcome the introduction of gender pay gap reporting and are committed to identifying the reasons for any gap 
that exists and working to eliminate it.
Our gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women employed by the Firm, 
regardless of their role or seniority. It is not a comparison of how much we pay men and women who carry out the 
same roles, similar roles or work of equal value.

UNDERSTANDING OUR RESULTS
Having  looked  at  our  pay  data  in  some 
detail  we  are  confident  that  men  and 
women  in  the  firm  are  paid  equally  for 
doing  equivalent  jobs.  Our  mean  gender 
pay gap of 19.6% is smaller than the mean 
for  the  UK  legal  sector,  which  is  24%. 
Our  median  gender  pay  gap  of  26.6%  is 
slightly  higher  than  the  UK  legal  sector 
median, which is 25.7%.

of  qualified  lawyers  is  much  higher  in 
the  upper-middle  and  upper  quartiles. 
To  illustrate  this  point  we  can  see  that 
when  we  separate  out  our  pay  gap  into 
fee earners and non-fee earners our gap 
becomes much smaller. 

Our  pay  gap  exists  primarily  because  of 
the  number  of  men  and  women  within 
different roles in the firm. We have more 
women than men in every quartile but this 
is  particularly  the  case  in  the  lower  and 
lower-middle  quartiles.  Our  secretarial 
and  business  services  roles,  which  are 
mostly found in the low-middle and lower 
quartiles,  have  a  very  high  proportion 
of  female  employees.  The  proportion 

The distribution of role types also affects 
our bonus gap too. Although more women 
than men received a bonus, the proportion 
of men receiving a bonus was higher. The 
value of bonuses awarded to men tended 
to be higher because of the distribution of 
their roles and as a result of a very small 
number of people who were remunerated 
primarily by means of a bonus.

to  understand 
While 
the  reasons  for  our  gap,  what  is  more 
important is what we plan to do about it.

Ian Wattie - 
MANAGING PARTNER

We  want  everyone  to  bring  their  best 
selves  to  work  and  to  feel  comfortable 
being who they are. 

We  recently  set  an 
initial  target  of 
having  30%  women  in  our  partnership 
by 1 August 2020. Currently 25% of our 
partners are women. 

Burness Paull has also become a member 
of  the  30%  club,  an  organisation  set  up 
to  campaign  for  greater  representation 
of  women  on  boards  with  a  target  of 
a  minimum  of  30%.  A  member  of  the 
senior leadership team will join on behalf 
of  the  firm.  We’re  excited  to  be  the 
first  Scottish  based  law  firm  to  join  the 
30% club. 

We  will  continue  to  monitor  the  gender 

I confirm the data reported is accurate.

When  recruiting  we  will  make  sure  we 
attract  a  diverse  pool  of  candidates  and 
ensure that our selection and promotion 
processes are monitored and reviewed.   

The  Diversity  and  Inclusion  Group  has 
sought  the  views  of  everyone  in  the 
firm  and  will  set  up  support  networks 
in  response  to  the  feedback  received.  In 
addition  they  will  create  an  action  plan, 
with the backing of the board, to address 
issues  and  barriers  to  gender  equality. 
They  will  look  at  areas  such  as  agile/
flexible working, recruitment, promotion, 
support  for  parents  and  carers,  training, 
coaching, mentoring and sponsorship. 

We  recognise  that  there  is  still  much 
work  to  be  done  and  we  are  committed 
to doing it.
