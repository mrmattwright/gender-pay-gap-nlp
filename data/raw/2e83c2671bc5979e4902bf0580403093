Initially set up as a partnership between the lead academy Abbey Grange and St Chad’s Primary School both in Leeds, Abbey MAT has since grown with the addition of our first sponsored academy, Lightcliffe Academy which is in Calderdale, near Halifax, and most recently has welcomed Bishop Young C of E Academy, Manston St James Primary, Holy Trinity Rothwell C of E Primary Academy and Lightcliffe CE Primary.    The ‘vision’ for the future of the group of academies within Abbey Multi Academy Trust (Abbey MAT) has been shaped through the identification of a number of key thoughts and assumptions that will build a framework within which Abbey MAT will operate.  As a Diocesan Multi Academy Trust we are committed to working within a caring and Christian ethos. The vision for the academies builds on that already established by Abbey Grange which is:    “To work in partnership to educate, nurture and empower”  Our vision is that the academies, supported by Abbey MAT, will provide an environment which is welcoming, caring, calm, disciplined and purposeful and will stretch our young people academically, support them pastorally and help them develop socially and spiritually.    We are committed to raising the skills base across our communities by ensuring a focus on quality, encouraging innovation and strengthening the ethos of the academies as distinctive schools. The framework will strive to maintain academies which will retain their own independent culture and ethos whilst operating within a strategic partnership to improve quality, share best practice and operate effectively and efficiently.
