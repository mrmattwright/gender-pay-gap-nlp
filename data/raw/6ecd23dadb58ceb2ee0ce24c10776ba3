Gender Pay Gap Data as at 31 March 2017 
 

Whilst Broxtowe Borough Council has produced its gender pay gap information for a 
number of years it is now mandatory to do so within the scope of a fixed set of 
guidelines. 

The gender pay gap is expressed as the difference in pay between males and 
females as a percentage of the male earnings. Both the mean and the median 
figures are required.
