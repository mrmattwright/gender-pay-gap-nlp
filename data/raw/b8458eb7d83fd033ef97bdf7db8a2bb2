We believe in being an inclusive organisation where everyone is rewarded fairly and can reach their career potential, regardless of their gender or background. As an example of our progress, our UK advisory business (CBRE Limited) is the first large, multi-disciplinary property advisor to be awarded the National Equality Standard accreditation, and won the corporate category at the Women of the Future Awards 2017.  Overview   CBRE’s Gender Pay Gap for its UK businesses (including all employing entities) is 17.35%. Our gap is mainly attributable to the fact that there are currently more men in senior roles within the business. This profile is characteristic of the wider property sector, which, whilst changing, has traditionally attracted fewer women. Our ambition to improve our gender balance has resulted in an increase in the number of women joining and staying at CBRE at all levels over recent years, and we have wide ranging programmes in place to create more opportunities for women to progress. This includes best practice around recruitment, training and development, promotion and reward and recognition.

The gender pay gap measures the total difference between men and women’s average pay (including bonus and reward contributions) across an organisation. This is different to equal pay, which refers to men and women receiving equal pay for equal work, and is a legal requirement in the UK.                "CBRE has been spearheading action to improve female retention and progression in the property sector for many years. The fact that we are now leading the way in achieving the National Equality Standard reinforces our passion for improving diversity at all levels "     Amanda Clack, Head of Strategic Consulting, CBRE Ltd UK                           Home    About Us    Services    CBRE Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement    Properties    Research    Media Centre    Investor Relations        Contact Us    Site Map    Privacy Policy    Terms of Use    Careers         Instagram       Twitter         LinkedIn
