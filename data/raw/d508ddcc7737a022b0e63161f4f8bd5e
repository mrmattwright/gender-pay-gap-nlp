Introduction 
 
We value the opportunity presented by this national reporting exercise to examine 
pay  across  genders  in  our  College.  The  purpose  of  this  national  requirement  is  to 
examine gender equality in the UK jobs market, with the aim of reducing the pay gap 
(Wild & CIPD, 2017). 
 
The Gender Pay Gap is not the same as the right to equal pay for equal work, and we 
do  not  have  an  equal  pay  issue.  Havering  Sixth  Form  College  (HSFC)  follows  pay 
structures agreed by the National Joint Council (NJC) in consultation with recognised 
trade unions. 
 
We are an equal opportunities employer holding both the Investors in Diversity (IID) 
and Investors in People (IIP) (Silver Award) standards.  
 
The College aims to recruit and promote the best candidates for our posts with the 
use of structured interviews against specific criteria. For support staff, we have in place 
a Job Evaluation procedure to ensure that our support staff are paid fairly for the work 
they  do.  These  job  evaluations  are  completed  by  a  trained  panel  who  make 
assessments based on defined criteria, irrespective of gender.  
 

What is the gender pay gap? 
The gender pay gap is the average difference in pay of female and male employees 
across the whole organisation. The pay gap is expressed as the percentage difference 
in amount by which an average male employee is paid compared to an average 
female employee.

The Gender Pay Gap 
 
The HSFC gender pay gap for full time employees is under 6% (Appendix 2). The overall 
mean  gender  pay  gap  across  the  whole  College  workforce  is comparable  to  the 
national average, when excluding the executive team (Table 1). However, the overall 
median (mid-point) gender pay gap is 19.7% higher than the national median (Table 
1). We believe that the mean pay gap is more representative than the median in our 
case,  owing  to  the  significantly  smaller  number  of  male  employees  in  the  College 
workforce.

There is no specific guidance on the calculation for term time only staff, only general 
guidance examples requiring division by 52 weeks and by hours worked per week. 
 
However, for all staff, we have annualised monthly pay and divided over ‘weeks paid’ 
and by normal hours expected to be worked. After considering the guidance from 
The  Sixth  Form  Colleges  Association  (SFCA),  Irwin  Mitchell  LLP  on  behalf  of  the 
Association Of Colleges (AOC), Harrison Clark Rickerbys Solicitors’ (Darwin, 2017) and 
Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals (CIPP), we believe that this ‘weeks paid’ 
method (applied to all staff consistently) gives a more accurate picture.

We pay fairly, so why is there a gender gap? 
 
Although the HSFC workforce is 66.4% female, there are a disproportionately higher 
number of these female employees in both the lower and lower middle pay quartiles 
in comparison to male employees (Appendix 3).  
 
At HSFC The majority of support positions are occupied by females and these positions 
are relatively lower paid (Appendix 1). Support positions are also generally term time 
only (part time) and attract female applicants from the local area. The skew in female 
employee distribution contributes to our gender pay gap. This is further supported by 
the change in our mean gender pay gap from 22.1% (Table 1) for the whole workforce, 
to just under 6% if we look at just full time employees in the College (Appendix 2). 

In our College, the only bonus that is paid is the NJC agreed performance related 
Standards Payment payable only to support staff once a year. The same £320 bonus 
is  paid  pro  rata  according  to  the  percentage  of  full  time  working,  irrespective  of 
gender.  Although  support  staff  are  predominantly 
they  are  also 
predominantly part time (Appendix 2). Whereas, male support staff are predominantly 
full time. This is the cause of our gender bonus gap. 
 
What we can learn 
We are confident that the overall gender pay gap is caused by a disproportionate 
number of female employees in lower paid and part time positions.

However, the HSFC mean gender pay gap in every quartile is also more than 10% 
lower than the overall national average (Table 1).

If we look at the gender pay gap by each individual pay quartile we can see that the 
average pay of female employees is: 
 

  higher than male employees in both the lower and lower middle quartile 
  equal to or almost equal to male employees in both the upper middle and 

upper quartiles

The College mean gender pay gap is greatest in the lower middle and upper pay 
quartiles. The lower middle pay quartile includes a large proportion of support staff 
and teachers on the lower teacher pay points 1-5. We have already noted that these 
positions are predominantly held by females and are relatively lower paid.  
The  upper  pay  quartile  includes  the  executive  team,  faculty  leaders  and  subject 
leaders  (Appendix  3).  At  HSFC  53%  of  faculty  leader  positions  and  52%  of  subject 
leader positions are held by female employees (Appendix 1). However, only 19% of all 
female employees employed either occupy faculty or subject leader positions. The 
executive team being predominantly male, also contributes to the gender pay gap 
in the upper quartile.  

Teacher  progression  on  the  pay  points  1-9  is  dependent  on  years  of  service,  with 
longer serving (and usually older) teachers occupying points 6-9. The gender pay gap 
has been found to be nationally much wider for older employees, from age 40 and 
above (Office for National Statistics, 2016).  

Lower paid roles, primarily casual and support roles, typically attract females from the 
local area which contributes to the gender pay gap in favour of females in the lower 
quartile. 

 
Can we close the gap? 
As  an  equal  opportunities  employer,  we  are  keen  to  contribute  to  narrowing  the 
national gender pay gap. Some actions that we have already planned are to:  

  offer mentoring or coaching programmes for females looking to become 

leaders and senior leaders at this College or elsewhere 

  develop recruitment strategies to encourage a more balanced workforce 
  continue  to  welcome  applications 
individuals 
  continue to widen the ‘reach’ of local advertising for lower paid roles 

irrespective of age, disability, ethnicity, gender, religion or sexuality 

from  suitably  skilled
