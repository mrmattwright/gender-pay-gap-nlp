Handicare UK - 
Gender Pay Gap Report

Background
Under new legislation, UK organisations with 
over 250 employees must publish their gender 
pay gap data by April 2018. Handicare UK is 
pleased to comply and is committed to equal 
opportunities in employment.
What is the gender pay gap?
The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference 
between the average earnings of men and women across 
an organisation. It is not the same as equal pay which looks 
at the pay difference between men and women doing similar 
jobs or work of equal value. At Handicare, we are confident 
that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent 
jobs across our business in the UK. 
Data used in the report
The data used to establish our Pay Gap was taken from 
the Handicare Accessibility Payroll for April 2017. A total 
of 298 employees were employed at that time.

What is our gender pay 
gap at Handicare UK?
We are confident that men and women are paid equally 
for doing equivalent jobs across our business. 
However, the most significant challenges we face in 
addressing our gender pay gap are:
•  We have a higher representation of 
  males in engineering roles
•  We have a higher representation of males in   
  management/leadership roles
•  We have a higher representation of females in 
  part-time roles.
•  The impact of this demographic contributes to the 
  pay and bonus gap outlined below, which is based 
  on data from April 2017.

The main driver for the gender pay gap at 
Handicare UK is the unequal distribution of 
men and women across the business.
If we focus our efforts on ensuring men and 
women are represented equally at all levels in 
our business, the gender pay gap will close.

We are committed to:
• Encouraging more people, particularly women, to consider 
  engineering and manufacturing as a career option.
• Exploring ways to enable all our people to work more flexibly
• On-going monitoring and evaluation of our progress in 
  closing the gender pay gap

“We want to reassure our people, potential employees, partners, and 
customers of our commitment to becoming a modern organisation fit 
for the 21st century. This report into our gender pay gap and any actions 
we take as a result of it, signal our commitment to creating an inclusive 
culture which allows all our people to fulfil their potential and which is 
attractive as a career option.”
Clare Brophy, Handicare UK Managing Director
