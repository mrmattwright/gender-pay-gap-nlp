GNM strongly supports the legislation 
requiring organisations with 250 or more 
employees to publish data on the gender 
pay gap, which is a step forward toward 
making the UK a fairer society.  We will do 
everything possible to close GNM’s gender 
pay gap. 

The data contained in this report for GNM 
is accurate.

Guardian News & Media (GNM) is 
committed to creating a workforce that is 
diverse and inclusive –  valuing everyone 
and taking action to ensure all employees 
feel respected.  

GNM’s gender pay gap is lower than 
the current ONS national average, but 
that is not good enough and we aim to 
reduce it further. The gap is driven by 
two main factors: there are more men in 
the highest paid and most senior roles; 
and there are more women in lower paid 
administration, sales and marketing 
roles. While this is the case at many 
organisations and reflects society more 
broadly, it does not make it acceptable. 
More must be done to improve women’s 
representation and ensure there are 
opportunities for everyone at GNM to 
progress.

Within five years we aim to achieve a 
50:50 gender balance in the top half of the 
organisation.  This is an ambitious goal 
but one we will strive to achieve.

We will achieve this by developing, 
promoting and recruiting more talented 
women at every level and in every part 
of the organisation.  Specific initiatives 
include fast-tracking women’s progression 
through GNM via a Women in Leadership 
programme for those in middle and 
senior management roles, and offering 
a mentoring scheme for all women. We 
will strengthen recruitment practices by 
ensuring female candidates are sought 
for all disciplines, and shortlists and 
interview panels are gender balanced.  
Each member of the GNM executive 
committee will have a personal objective 
and a departmental plan relating to 
diversity and gender pay.

GNM is committed to helping staff balance 
careers with caring responsibilities, and 
offers flexible working wherever possible, 
allowing roles of all levels to be job-
shared. The 16% of staff who work part-
time hours do not negatively contribute 
to GNM’s gender pay gap, and a high 
proportion of women return to work after 
maternity leave.

Methodology

Gender pay and  
not equal pay

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly 
earnings of all men and women in an organisation irrespective 
of role.

It is not to be confused with equal pay – paying individuals 
performing the same or a similar role differently because of their 
gender has been illegal since 1970.

Methodology

(continued)

How median and mean 
gaps are calculated

The government requires employers to 
report both the mean and median gender 
pay gaps in their workforce, as well as 
information on bonuses and pay quartiles.

The proportion of men and women 
awarded a bonus has been reported as 
well as the gender gap relating to bonuses.  
Mean and median calculations were used 
when comparing bonuses for men and 
women from 6 April 2016-5 April 2017, 
in line with the government’s reporting 
requirements.

The median is the figure that falls in the middle of a range 
when everyone’s wages are lined up from smallest to largest. 
The median gap is the difference between the employee in the 
middle of the range of male wages and the middle employee in 
the range of female wages.

The mean commonly known as the average, is calculated when 
you add up the wages of all employees and divide the figure by 
the number of employees. 

The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male 
pay and mean female pay.

GNM 2017 results

GNM’s gender pay gap

GNM’s gender pay gap has been calculated 
according to the UK government’s 
methodology. The pay data of 1,557 UK 
employees was analysed as of 5 April 2017 
(876 men and 681 women), including all 
UK GNM full- and part-time employees 
and casual workers.  The data does not 
include freelancers or other staff not on 
GNM’s UK payroll. Anyone not receiving 
full pay on 5 April 2017 was also excluded 
from the hourly pay calculations.

The current ONS national average is 18.4% 
median.

Women earn less than men on an hourly 
basis on both mean and median measures.

The gender pay  
gap within GNM

GNM is a diverse organisation with 
a range of roles and specialisms. In 
editorial, we have a narrower range of 
roles and a more consistent pay structure. 
In non-editorial departments, there is a 
greater range of roles and salaries, and a 
higher proportion of men in the highest 
paid roles.

Bonus data

Of the 218  bonuses paid (14% of men and 
women), most were sales commissions 
paid to sales staff – a combination of 
men and women – with about 40 smaller 
awards made to the all-male print site 
technicians.  This resulted in a median 
and mean gender bonus gap favourable 
towards women.

Pay quartiles

GNM is made up of 56% men and 44% 
women. The total population of 1,557 
was divided into the four pay groups to 
the right, each containing approximately 
390 employees. The data shows there are 
more men in the the top two combined 
pay quartiles, 64% of employees in the top 
half of the organisation are men (495 men 
compared with 284 women).

Why is there a 
gender pay gap  
at GNM?

GNM’s gender pay gap is lower than the 
current ONS national average, but that is 
not good enough and we aim to reduce it 
further.

There are two main factors that contribute to GNM’s gender pay gap:

1. There are more men in the top half of the organisation and not enough women in 

the highest paid and most senior roles

2. There are more women in lower paid administration, sales and marketing roles 

across the organisation

What we will do

How we will  
achieve this

Aim to reduce the gender pay gap at GNM 
every year
Increase the number of women in the 
highest paid half of the organisation 
every year
Within five years, aim to achieve a 50:50 
gender balance in the top half of the 
organisation
This will be achieved by developing, 
promoting and recruiting more talented 
women at every level and in every part of 
the organisation

1. Fast-track women’s progression across 
the organisation:
a new Women in Leadership programme 
for middle management and senior 
women and a new mentoring scheme for 
all women 

2. Strengthen recruitment practices:
mandate mixed-gender candidate 
shortlists and mixed-gender interview 
panels for all roles and seek out female 
candidates in all disciplines

3. Monitor pay and progression 
processes:
ensure all pay and promotion processes 
make a positive contribution to women’s 
progression and reduce the gender pay 
gap

4. Review minimum pay: 
to ensure staff in the lower quartiles are 
paid fairly and GNM is not replicating 
societal factors

5. Offer enhanced training:
and development opportunities in areas 
such as people management, dignity 
at work, unconscious bias – aim for all 
managers to be trained by the end of 
2018

6. Set objectives: 
every member of the GNM executive 
committee will have a personal objective 
and a departmental plan relating to 
diversity and gender pay

7. Consult: 
continue to engage with employee 
forums and stakeholders to help close 
GNM’s gender pay gap. These include the 
NUJ and Unite unions, the Diversity and 
Inclusion forum, and the Remuneration 
Committee Information and Consultation 
Forum (RCICF)

8. Governance and oversight:
progress will be monitored by RCICF, 
GNM’s pay consultation body made 
up of a representative group of staff 
and chaired by a non-executive board 
member

Diversity and 
inclusion

Gender is one strand of GNM’s overall 
diversity and inclusion agenda, the 
aim of which is to cultivate a working 
environment that celebrates and supports 
difference in all its forms. 

Other initiatives include establishing a 
work experience scheme 15 years ago to 
give individuals from black, Asian and 
minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds and 
those with disabilities the chance to work 
at GNM. Successful applicants spend up 
to three weeks as part of editorial teams, 
with mentors assigned to offer careers 
advice and help them get the most out of 
the placement. This year for the first time 
GNM is offering placements for BAME 
photographers.

Through the Guardian Foundation, 
staff have the opportunity to mentor 
local sixth-form students and provide 
advice and guidance to help them 
make informed decisions about their 
futures. The Guardian Foundation also 
offers a number of bursaries each year 
for aspiring journalists to study for an 
MA in journalism. The primary aim of 
these bursaries is to assist students who 
face financial difficulty in attaining the 
qualifications needed to pursue a career in 
media.

GNM has hosted women in technology 
events for the past three years to inspire 
young women to take up careers in digital. 
Recently, 50 schoolgirls from around the 
country met inspiring women from GNM’s 
digital team and took part in learning 
about coding, data, user experience and 
product development. They learned about 
how journalists and digital teams work 
together, and discussed the film CODE: 
Debugging the gender gap.

We support this important piece 
of legislation, which we believe 
will have a positive long-term 
impact on gender pay issues 
in the UK.  Our commitment to 
equality goes beyond gender 
to ensuring our workforce is 
diverse, inclusive and reflects 
the society we serve. We have a 
good foundation from which to 
improve and our ambition is to 
close and eliminate the gender 
pay gap.
