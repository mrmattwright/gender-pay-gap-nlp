depending on which average is taken. 
The median result reports that females 
are paid more bonus than men while 
the mean reports the opposite.   

 

The proportion receiving bonus looks 
at the percentage of men and women 
that receive a bonus in relation to 
their gender group.   

25.12% of males receive a bonus 

21.57% of females receive a bonus  

 

 

 

*a positive gap means males are paid more than females, while a negative gap means females are paid more than males

The quartile pay bands show the split between male and female employees in the lowest to highest 
paid positions.  To obtain this data, job roles within the company are sorted from lowest to highest 
paid and then separated into four groups or “quartiles”.   The lower quartile contains the lowest paid 
employees and the upper quartile contains the highest.   

 

Narrative 

Ordinary Pay Gap 

•  As at 5 April 2017 FTA employed 16% more males than females. Of the total 211 males, 40% 
worked in field-based Vehicle Inspection Service (VIS) Operations, which is the only all-male 
department within the company.  VIS Operations roles are classed as engineering positions 
within FTA.  They tend to be higher paid, sitting within the third and upper pay quartiles.   
 

•  Historically, women have occupied only a very small percentage of engineering jobs within 
the UK.  And while good progress is being made to address this, in 2017, females still only 
equated to less than a quarter of the UK’s engineering population1.   

 
• 

Jobs within the lower and second quartiles were mainly occupied by females. However, 14% 
of females within these pay bands had a team leader or management role, compared to 8% of 
males. This signifies that job progression is available for females in the lower pay bands but 
becomes limited thereafter when considering that the third quartile is 86% male.  The vast 
majority of male roles within the third quartile were VIS Operations engineering positions. 
 

•  The upper quartile comprises of FTA’s executive team and other more senior positions within 
the business.  While 21% of the upper quartile is made up of VIS Operations roles, females are 
reasonably well represented at this level.  Of the 8 executive directors, 3 were female.  And of 
those occupying the 13 senior leadership2 roles, 6 were female members of staff.

Bonus Pay Gap 

•  Bonus  opportunities  were  not  confined  to  the  more  senior  positions  within  FTA.    The 
proportion of males and females who worked in bonus-structured roles was relatively similar 
when comparing by gender.   
 

•  Results differ when calculating the average bonus paid to men and women.  The mean bonus 
pay  for  men  was  15.63%  higher  than  for  women.    This  is  likely  to  be  because  the  bonus 
amounts  paid  to  employees  in  the  upper  quartile  were  higher  and  this  quartile  is 
predominantly male.   
 

•  The median bonus result put females higher than males.  The median is the number found at 
the exact middle after separating the bonus payments to males and females and sorting them 
from lowest to highest.  Where data is skewed by very high or very low values at either end, 
the median can be the better suited result than the mean.   
 

•  FTA’s view is that the bonus pay data was distributed evenly enough for the mean to be an 

accurate representation of the bonus pay gap.   
 

 

Actions 

FTA is committed to improving gender balance and diversity at all levels by: 

➢  having a strategic business objective to improve and enable gender balance and diversity 

throughout the business; 

➢  reviewing our approach to recruitment to encourage further gender diversity especially in 

areas such as engineering and IT within which we have a high proportion of males; 

➢  continually reviewing and updating our policies to ensure they promote gender equality; 
➢  regularly reviewing our remuneration practices; 
➢  using the new ‘Delivery Review’ and ‘Job Route’ performance management process to drive 

fairness and consistency in feedback and career conversations irrespective of role;  

➢  raising awareness of flexible working options amongst our people managers to encourage a 

more gender diverse workforce; and 

➢  actively supporting alternative working arrangements for our employees under the flexible 

working policy available to all staff. 

 

We can confirm that the data reported is accurate.
