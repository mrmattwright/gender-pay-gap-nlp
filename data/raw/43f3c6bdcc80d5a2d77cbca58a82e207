Introduction

This Report contains the BBC’s statutory 
disclosure of the gender pay gap for the  
BBC Public Service. It also contains additional 
voluntary disclosures of other pay gap  
and gender analysis. The BBC has had 
selected calculations and results 
independently assured by EY (as set out  
on pages 9 and 10).

All companies with 250 or more employees 
are now required to publish their gender pay 
gap under new legislation that came into force 
in April 2017. Employers have to publish the 
gap in pay between men and women on both 
a median basis (pay per hour based on the 
person ‘in the middle’ of the distribution of 
pay) and a mean basis (average hourly salary). 
In addition, employers are required to disclose 
the distribution of gender by pay quartile –  
in other words splitting the workforce into 
four groups based on their pay, and showing 
the proportion of men and women in each 
group. Employers are also required to disclose 
percentages of staff receiving bonuses by 
gender and the gender gap on bonuses. 

Since 2009 we have been publishing the 
remuneration of Senior Managers paid over 
£150,000 p.a. We have also been disclosing 
the number of all Senior Managers in broad 
pay bands as well as the pay of our on-air 
talent in similar broad pay bands. 

In July 2017, in line with our Royal Charter 
commitments, we published the names of  
all employees and on-air talent paid over 
£150,000 p.a., again in pay bands. 
 
The BBC welcomes and supports gender pay 
gap reporting across the public and private 
sector. The BBC has long been committed to 
equal opportunities. Nevertheless, the BBC  
is not immune to broader societal issues 
affecting women in the workforce.

This Report provides both the statutory 
disclosures required of the BBC Public 
Service, as well as further context around 
gender pay at the BBC. In compiling this 
Report we have included data for people on 
staff contracts (both permanent and fixed 
term contracts). This includes those of our 
on-air presenters who have BBC staff 
contracts, but not presenters on freelance 
contracts or certain agency workers*.

The BBC is also publishing today a 
management response setting out the actions 
we will take to address the gender pay gap  
set out in this Report.

Gender pay gap
The gender pay gap is the difference between  
the hourly rate of pay of male employees and 
female employees (as set out in the regulations), 
expressed as a percentage of the hourly pay rate of 
the male employees. The gender pay gap is reported 
on both a mean (average) and median (mid-point 
on a distribution) basis.

Equal pay
UK law has, since the 1970s, prohibited paying 
different amounts to men and women who are 
doing ‘like work’, ‘work of equal value’ or ‘work  
rated as equivalent’ unless there is a ‘genuine 
material factor’ for the difference.

.

Mean vs. median
The Gender Pay Gap reporting regulations 
specifically require both the median and mean to  
be reported. These metrics are complementary, and 
illustrate different aspects of the distribution of pay 
across an organisation. The median is a statistic 
commonly used in analysing both internal pay 
tendency and external market norms, because it 
looks at the central tendency of the market or 
sample, showing the middle-most salary of a sample. 
Calculating the median involves taking all salaries  
in a sample, lining them up in order from lowest to 
highest, and picking the middle-most salary. 
The mean is the overall average of the whole 
sample and thus can be subject to the influences  
of any extremely high or low salaries at the top or 
bottom of the sample. In other words, the mean  
is much more subject to skewing by a small number 
of outliers.

* In line with the Regulations governing gender 
pay gap reporting we have excluded those 
people for whom the data required to calculate 
the gender pay gap is not readily available. 
This group includes those of our on-air talent 
who are not on staff contracts, freelancers 
and contractors. The BBC is endeavouring to 
establish a process whereby working hours 
associated with those arrangements can 
be captured to allow for inclusion in future 
years’ reporting. The BBC also excludes from 
their Gender Pay Gap reporting 295 agency 
workers that were engaged full-time for 
the BBC (but employed through third party 
agency providers). Despite efforts being made 
to include these in the March 2017 report, 
complete information needed to perform the 
Gender Pay Gap calculations was not available 
for this population. This population will not be 
included in future years as from 1 April 2017 
further clarification on the status of these 
agency workers means they will be reported  
by the agency that supplies them.

THE GENDER  
PAY GAP
The difference

an organisation.

Nationally, one of the main 
reasons for the gender pay 
gap is more men are likely to 

hold senior positions.

A hypothetical Company X has  
50 employees (25 of each sex), five 
grades and equal pay between  
men and women at each grade, but

Gender at the BBC

The BBC has published detailed information  
on the gender, BAME and disability 
breakdown of its workforce for ten years. 
Between 2008 and 2015, the BBC Trust 
reported regularly on the effectiveness of the 
BBC’s arrangements in promoting equal 
opportunities. The requirement to consider 
equal opportunities has been part of the 
BBC’s Royal Charter for over 20 years.

Overall, the BBC Public Service* has a 48% 
female and 52% male workforce. The 
percentage of female members of staff is 
higher at the lower grades of the organisation, 
with increasing percentages of men at higher 
grades. At the lowest grades of the organisation 
(Grades 1–4) the BBC has a 59% female/41% 
male mix. As we move to Grades 5–9, the 
largest group of employees, this mix moves to 
46% female/54% male. Within Grades 10 and 
11 and Senior Managers, the public service 
has a 41% female/59% male mix.

regulations.

The gender pay gap 
at the BBC

The overall gender pay gap as at 31 March 
2017 at the BBC is 9.3% on a median basis 
(10.7% using mean pay). This compares to the 
UK median which, as reported by the Office 
of National Statistics, is 18.1%.

We have also analysed the gender pay gap by 
our existing grade structure, as shown in the 
table below:

Table 2. Gender pay gap by grades

The chart below sets out the gender profile 
by pay quartile. The fact that there are more 
women in the lower paid quartile and at the 
lower grades of the BBC is a major driver of 
the overall gender pay gap. 

Our analysis shows that 9.1% of the 10.7% 
total mean gap is driven by this structural 
issue (equivalent to 7.5% of the median gap) 
leaving a residual pay difference of less than 
2%. Other organisations have already 
reported similar issues, with the structural 
demographic pay gap being the single most 
significant factor in the overall gender pay gap. 
This issue has also been recognised by the  
UK government*. 

The residual pay difference can arise from a 
number of factors, including differing levels  
of skills and experience for people doing 
otherwise similar jobs as well as the impact  
of market factors. The BBC has undertaken  
an independent Equal Pay Audit to analyse  
the causes of the pay differences in staff  
grades 2–11.

This analysis shows that the gender pay gap  
is smaller in each grade than the figures for 
the BBC overall, consistent with the explanation 
above that the main driver for the BBC 
gender pay gap is the demographic pay gap. 
At the very top of the organisation, for the 
highest paid management staff (those Senior 
Managers paid over £150,000 whose 
remuneration is publicly disclosed), the 
gender pay gap is minimal.

Pay gaps on other  
diversity measures

We have also looked at the pay gaps for  
other diversity characteristics (based on the 
information available to the BBC), including 
BAME and disability, and we are making 
voluntary disclosures of these figures. The 
results of this analysis are shown in the table 
to the right, and show gaps that are smaller 
than those for gender, but which we believe 
are driven by the same demographic factor 
(i.e. that we have fewer BAME and disabled 
staff at the top grades in the organisation) as 
well as lack of representation in certain roles:

* In addition to the vouchers, during the reporting 
period there were 30 cash payments made 
in respect of a recognition scheme for graded 
staff that closed at the end of Financial Year 
2015/16. A small number of individuals (24) 
received contractual payments associated with 
the commercial success of certain programmes 
during the reporting period. These payments are 
not funded by the licence fee and are paid from 
and linked to delivery of commercial revenues.

Statutory Disclosures

The tables below show the overall median 
and mean gender pay gap, as well as the 
gender bonus gap, based on hourly rates of 
pay of those employed on the snapshot date 
of 31 March 2017 and bonuses paid in the 
year to 31 March for the BBC Public Service. 
The BBC Public Service ended all 
discretionary senior management and 
executive bonuses funded by the licence  
fee in 2009. 

The BBC currently runs a voucher-based 
recognition scheme that allows graded staff to 
be rewarded for exceptional performance. The 
vouchers are typically for relatively small 
amounts. During the year some 1,600 staff 
received vouchers, with the median for both 
men and women being £200*. Although the 
BBC does not regard the voucher scheme as a 
bonus payment, in the interest of transparency 
and in line with government guidance both 
cash and voucher payments have been used  
to calculate the gender bonus gap for this 
statutory disclosure.

The analysis of our gender gap figures shows 
that the majority of the gap has arisen 
because we have a lower proportion of 
women in leadership and senior roles in  
our organisation.
 
The BBC requested that EY perform  
an assurance engagement on selected data 
and statements presented in this report. The 
respective responsibilities of EY and the BBC, 
the scope of the review, limitations and 
conclusions are set out in EY’s full assurance 
statement on pages 9 and 10. 

Tony Hall
BBC Director-General

The gender pay gap of 9.3% set out in the 
table above is based on the BBC’s staff in 
England, Scotland and Wales, in line with the 
requirements of the regulations. If we include 
our staff in Northern Ireland the figure is 9.6%.

BBC Statutory Gender Pay Report 2017Assurance Statement

Independent Assurance Statement to British Broadcasting 
Corporation’s Management

The BBC have requested that we perform  
an assurance engagement on selected 
performance data and statements presented 
in the British Broadcasting Corporation’s 
(‘the BBC’) 2017 Gender Pay Gap statutory 
disclosures for the BBC Public Service (‘the 
Report’). This would be a ‘limited level’ 
assurance engagement as set out in the 
ISAE3000 (Revised). 

Respective responsibilities
The BBC’s management are responsible  
for the collection and presentation of the 
information within the Report. Management 
are also responsible for the design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal 
controls relevant to the preparation of the 
Report, so that it is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Our responsibility, in accordance with
management’s instructions, is to carry out
a ‘limited level’ assurance engagement
on selected data in the Report.

We do not accept or assume any 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person or organisation. Any reliance 
any such third party may place on the Report 
is entirely at its own risk.

What we did to form our conclusions 
Our assurance engagement has been 
designed to provide a limited level of 
assurance in accordance with ISAE3000 
(Revised)*. The criteria we have used to 
evaluate the selected data (‘the Criteria’) are 
described in the Gender Pay Gap legislation† 
and within the Report as footnotes.

The procedures we performed were based 
on our professional judgement and included 
the steps outlined below: 

1.  Interviewed a selection of internal 

stakeholders from Senior Management, 
Legal, Compliance, Human Resources and 
Payroll to understand the current status of 
the gender pay gap within the BBC, the 
methodology, definition and approach used 
to calculate the gender pay gap, and structure 
of the data processes and current controls to 
support data quality.

2.  Carried out the following activities to 

review gender pay gap data samples and 
processes:
a.  Reviewed disaggregated gender pay 

gap data from the BBC’s Public Service 
to assess whether the data had been 
collected, consolidated and reported 
accurately. 

b.  Reviewed and challenged supporting 

evidence provided. 

c.  Tested whether gender pay gap data had 

been collected, consolidated and reported 
appropriately and accurately at the 
aggregate level.

3.  Challenged and reviewed selected 

disclosures in the Report to assess accuracy 
and balance, and consistency with 
observations made during work steps  
1 and 2 as set out above.

Our review of the data processes was limited 
to the following statutory disclosure data: 
•  the difference between the mean hourly rate 
of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and 
that of female full-pay relevant employees; 
•  the difference between the median hourly 

rate of pay of male full-pay relevant 
employees and that of female full-pay 
relevant employees;

•  the difference between the mean bonus pay 

paid to male relevant employees and that 
paid to female relevant employees;

•  the difference between the median bonus 

pay paid to male relevant employees and that 
paid to female relevant employees;

•  the proportions of male and female relevant 

employees who were paid bonus pay; and

•  the proportions of male and female full-pay 

relevant employees in the lower, lower 
middle, upper middle and upper quartile  
pay bands.

Our assurance engagement did not include 
procedures over any additional KPIs or 
content within the Report.

Assurance Statement – continued

Independent Assurance Statement to British Broadcasting 
Corporation’s Management 

The limitations of our review
Our evidence gathering procedures were 
designed to obtain a ‘limited level’ of 
assurance as set out in ISAE3000 (Revised) 
on which to base our conclusions. The extent 
of evidence gathering procedures performed 
is less than that of a ‘reasonable assurance’ 
engagement (such as a financial accounting 
audit) and therefore a lower level of assurance 
is provided. 

Completion of our testing activities has 
involved placing reliance on the BBC’s  
controls for managing and reporting gender 
pay gap information, with the degree of 
reliance informed by the results of our review 
of the effectiveness of these controls. We 
have not sought to review systems and 
controls at the BBC beyond those used for 
gender pay gap data.

Our conclusions 
Based on the scope of our review our 
conclusions are outlined below:

How complete and accurate is the gender 
pay gap information in the Report?
•  With the exception of exclusions described 

in the Report (in particular on page 3), 
we are not aware of any material payroll 
accounts or employees that have been 
excluded from the selected gender pay gap 
statutory disclosures.

•  Nothing has come to our attention that 

causes us to believe that the selected gender 
pay gap data has not been collated properly 
from BBC systems.

•  We are not aware of any errors that 

would materially affect the selected data as 
presented in the Report. 

Our independence 
With the exception of this work, we have 
provided no other assurance services relating 
to the BBC’s Gender Pay Gap reporting.
We have implemented measures to ensure 
that we are in compliance with the applicable 
independence and professional competence 
rules as articulated by the IFAC Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants and ISQC1.
