PDF, 342 KB       CDSA Certification  PDF, 191 KB                Product Safety Certification           Product Safety Certification   Sony DADC has been working diligently with consumer product safety specialists, industry representatives, and its customers to assure compliance with the newly enacted 2008 Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (“CPSIA”). This legislation institutes new testing and certification requirements for manufactured goods deemed to be children’s products, toys or other such items imported or distributed in commerce that qualify as being subject to safety rules, bans, standards or regulations enforced by the Consumer Products Safety commission (“CPSC”). As such, Sony DADC is fully committed to complying with the CPSIA and all other applicable laws. To this end, Sony DADC has completed testing on each of its products and standard packaging configurations, including all constituent elements such as cases, artwork and applied labeling. All of the aforementioned testing was conducted at CPSC-approved third party laboratories.    Although Sony DADC is able to certify that the products it manufactures comply with CPSIA regulations (provided all elements of such products are sourced by Sony DADC), Sony DADC also needs to be certain that any other items that it packages with its products are compliant as well. Therefore, if and when you send to Sony DADC any items to be included with Sony DADC’s products, please first indicate whether any such item is a children’s product or a children’s toy. If any of the items you provide are classified as such, please also include a copy of the conformity certificate for each relevant item. Without such compliance certificates in hand, Sony DADC will be unable to perform the requested manufacturing services. Furthermore, please note that the CPSC-approved third party testing data that supports the results indicated on the certificate must be available upon request. Finally, for any items that you provide to Sony DADC that are not considered children’s products or children’s toys (such as special packaging elements, inserts and other items) but which are intended to be included with such products, Sony DADC will require copies of the third party test data, though a formal certificate is not necessary.    Please note that the requests defined herein apply to all children’s products, or other materials supplied to Sony DADC to be included with any children’s product, that are to be shipped on or after December 21, 2008.
