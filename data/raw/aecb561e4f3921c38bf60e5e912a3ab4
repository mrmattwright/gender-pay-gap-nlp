The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Across the UK economy, there are many reasons for the gap including, for example, the way society values different skill levels or types of work.  On a mean basis our UK company-wide overall gender pay gap as at April 2017 is 12.85%, which is significantly lower than the UK national average of 18.1%.  Our report outlines that, although we do have a gender pay gap, we are already working hard to minimise it across the Priory Group.
