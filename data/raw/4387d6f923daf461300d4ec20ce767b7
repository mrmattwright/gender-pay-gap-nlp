The Public Sector Equality Duty places specific duties on public authorities to:   Eliminate unlawful discrimination , harassment and victimisation.  Advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it  Foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.   The duties the Act places on us as a local authority are a challenge for us to continue to examine our practices and policies to ensure that all our residents and service users are treated equally. The emphasis is not on merely complying with legislation.  We believe that considering how people will be affected by our activities is integral to the work we do. We want to treat everyone fairly, commission and procure services based on their needs and help them feel part of the community and contribute to a fairer society. It is also an opportunity for us to raise the profile of equality and diversity issues across the District and with our partners.  Our approach to Equality and Diversity is one of common sense, bringing people into the heart of everything the council does. Our approach puts people, both our customers and our staff at the heart of what we do and forms the platform for our transparent and fair decision making and service provision.  Equality and Diversity  We are committed to ensuring that we treat everyone who lives, works and visits our district with dignity and respect.  We are further committed to:   Equality of opportunity  Tackling discrimination  Tackling harassment and intimidation  Promoting good relations through the district   Equality and Diversity Strategy 2016-2020 (PDF File, 871kb)  We believe that we have a leading role to play in promoting equal opportunity and valuing diversity in the community, as an employer and as a provider of services to the people within the district and its visitors. We also recognise and are committed to meeting our duties under equality legislation.  Equal Pay and Measuring the Gender Pay Gap  Equal Pay deals with the pay difference between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.  The Gender Pay Gap is different to equal pay and looks at the average earnings for both males and females to see whether there is a disparity. The Gender Pay Gap legislation introduced in April 2017 requires private and public sector employers with 250 plus employees to report the following information on an annual basis:   the difference between the mean and median average hourly rate of pay for male and female employees;  the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the pay bands;  the gender pay gap for any bonuses paid out during the year.   Please note that the Council does not pay bonuses and therefore there are no figures to report in this regard.
