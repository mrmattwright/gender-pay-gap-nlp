                     ☰     Our work & services  Events & news  Our story & culture  Careers  Contact             Linney: Gender Pay Gap Report        As a company with 250+ employees, the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 requires Linney to publish specific gender pay gap information.  The following figures are taken from the pay period up to April 2017. They include financial jargon you may be unfamiliar with.  So, here’s your guide to some of the terms we’ll be using.  Gender pay The gender pay gap compares a simple average of the pay of full-time male and female Linney employees. The gender pay gap is different to equal pay , which takes into account the nature and seniority of a role.  Mean figure This is the difference between the average of men’s and women’s pay.  Median figure This is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of men’s and women’s pay.  OUR FIGURES  These are the figures the regulations require us to report:  Mean gender pay gap in hourly rate 20.2%  Median gender pay gap in hourly rate 19.7%  Mean bonus gender pay gap 62.4%  Median bonus gender pay gap 18.8%  Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  Male 7.9%  Female 2.6%  Proportion (%) of males and females in each pay quartile  Male    Female  Upper                           71          29  Middle Upper          71          29  Middle Lower          51          49  Lower                           42          58  However, we’re not interested in meeting minimum requirements – either in terms of delivering for our clients or sharing information with our colleagues. So, we’ve compiled more statistics in an attempt to paint an even clearer picture of gender pay at Linney.  Mean gender pay gap in hourly rate per quartile  Upper quartile 10.5%  Upper mid quartile 0.1%  Lower mid quartile 2.5%  Lower quartile 0.9%  Mean gender pay gap in hourly rate of Linney people employed over the last five years  5yrs      4yrs       3yrs        2yrs         1yr  1.4%     0.7%     -1.5%     -3.9%      -5.9%  Historically, core elements of Linney’s manufacturing process – such as print and fulfilment – have been male dominated disciplines. This is true of similar businesses around the world.  However, Linney’s growth and diversification over the past decade has resulted in an increase in female employees across all quartiles and every discipline – creative, administrative, manufacturing and fulfilment.
