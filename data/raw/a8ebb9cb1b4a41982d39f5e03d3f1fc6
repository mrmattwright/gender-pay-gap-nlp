We are confident that we are paying people equally for similar roles. Gender pay analysis shows that our lawyers are just as likely to be women as men and we have an even split of men and women in our highest paid roles.  However, like many other legal and professional services firms the people in our business support and administrative roles are mainly women. These are among our lower paid roles. This factor has had the biggest impact on our gender pay gap figures.    “ I’ve always listened to our people and acted on their suggestions to make our firm a great place to work. I will ensure the firm takes the same approach to our gender pay gap .”  Robert Camp, managing partner    Download our full Gender Pay Gap Report for 2017      Download our 2017 report                    Contact us for expert advice                   First Name     Last Name      Email Address     Telephone     How can we help?
