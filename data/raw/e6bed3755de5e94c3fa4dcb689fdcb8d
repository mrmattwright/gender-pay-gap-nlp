Gender Pay Gap Report  
2017

Committed to equal opportunities for all

Women make up 50% of our UK workforce and 30% of our Operating 
Board. However, many of our most senior (and therefore highest‑paid) 
people are currently male, a factor that influences both our gender pay 
and bonus gaps. This results in a gender pay gap of 10.3%, which is 
significantly less that the national average* of 18.1%.

At Stonegate, we are committed to both the 
development of all of our employees and to ensuring  
that we operate a meritocracy, where progression 
is open to all on the basis of talent and potential 
rather than any other factors. We operate an award 
winning career development programme and have 
industry‑leading engagement levels. This demonstrates 
that we have the platform in place to ensure that we 
remain an employer where opportunities are open to all.

I am, however, committed to understanding whether  
there are any cultural barriers within our business  
that might be hindering the progression of women  
into senior roles, and we will spend the next few 
months ascertaining if this is the case and what,  
if anything, we need to do differently.

This will help us to achieve our vision and strengthen 
our position as the leading managed operator of  
drink‑led pubs in the UK market.

STONEGATE PUB COMPANY  GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017Understanding the gender pay gap

Put simply, the gender pay gap is an equality measure that shows the  
difference in average earnings between women and men across our business.  
This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings and is recorded in two ways:  
the mean and median. 

To calculate our mean gap, we take 
the average pay for all women and 
the average pay for all men. We then 
divide the difference between these two 
numbers by the male average figure 
and multiply it by 100. This gives us our 
mean gap as a percentage. 

Our median gap is calculated by taking all payments made to women from highest 
to lowest and all payments made to men from highest to lowest. We then identify the 
middle payment made to men and women. The median is the difference between 
these two numbers divided by the male number and multiplied by 100.

The national gender pay gap 

average is

18.1%

Similarly, the gender bonus pay gap 
is an equality measure that shows the 
difference in bonus payments earned 
over the year between men and women. 
It is expressed as a percentage of men’s 
bonus earnings and again is recorded as 
the mean and median.

STONEGATE PUB COMPANY  GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017Making sense of the data

We are committed to ensuring  
that everyone is rewarded fairly 
for their work. Our mean gender 
pay gap of 10.3% is below the UK 
average* of 18.1%.
Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that women 
represent 50% of our population. 30% of our Operating 
Board is made up of women. 79% of employees in 
senior higher paid roles are male, which is the main 
reason for our gender pay gap. 

We offer a profit-led bonus scheme that our Site 
Managers and Pub Support Team are eligible for. 
The mean gap has a larger disparity due to the 
number of males in more senior higher paying roles.

RECRUITMENT
We are particularly proud of our strengths based 
recruitment approach. By engaging with employees 
at all levels through focus groups we were able to 
identify our ‘7 strengths to success’ within Stonegate. 
This means we focus on attitude and motivations over 
experience when recruiting, thus supporting our equal 
opportunities ethos. 
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
People have always been at the heart of the 
organisation within Stonegate and ‘Albert’s Theory  
of Progression’ is the key platform for the career path 
that enables each and every one of our employees to 
have the opportunity to achieve their ambition.

Our comprehensive ‘Albert’s Theory of Progression’ 
interactive career development pathway consists 
of a number of programmes that pull together the 
structured learning that is the foundation of the career 
path offered from the ‘bar to the boardroom’ culture 
which we embrace as a business. It was introduced 
to demonstrate the career path opportunities, and the 
learnings required to progress within the business. 
Each programme, fully supported by the Board and 
Senior Team, sees employees move rapidly from team 
member to General Manager and General Managers 
moving into the pub support management teams.

STONEGATE APPRENTICESHIPS
Stonegate Apprenticeship has seen over 2,000 
employees engage with the programme since 
it launched in 2011. These ‘Stonegate mapped’ 
Apprenticeships sit on the National Qualifications 
Framework ensuring that the employees working 
their way through Albert’s Theory of Progression gain 
nationally recognised qualifications along the way.

With the introduction of the new standards,  
Stonegate has developed a Back of House Career 
Pathway, ‘Evolution’, for the development of Kitchen 
Teams from a team member through to Area Chef.  
The new L3/L4 standard has been designed,  
developed and tailored to the business to enhance 
learning in four key areas: Leadership, Customer, 
Business and People, with an added training aid  
called FUSE to adapt to all learning styles.

Our ‘Albert’s Theory  

of Progression’ interactive 
career development pathway 
is the foundation of the career 

path offered from the  
‘bar to the boardroom’.
