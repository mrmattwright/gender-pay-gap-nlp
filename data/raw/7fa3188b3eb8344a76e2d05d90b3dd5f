Our staff are key to our success.  In line with UK Government policy and along with other universities and businesses with 250 or more employees, we have published our gender pay gap data.  I want to emphasise that the gender pay gap is not about equal pay – men and women doing the same job at Durham University are paid the same amount. Rather, the gender pay gap is the percentage difference between the average hourly earnings for men and women.  Our mean gender pay gap for the year to April 2017, including staff on casual contracts, is 25.35%. This reflects the fact that we have more men than women in higher paid roles.  Looking at our gender pay gap figures in more detail, the gap is less than 5% in all grades with the exception of Grades 2 and 3.  Our report also considers staff bonuses, which were received by less than 2% of our staff for the year to April 2017, and which include merit rewards and other discretionary payments made to staff. Our mean bonus gender pay gap is 64.29%.  We recognise that the gender pay gap is a serious issue for Durham University, as it is for society as a whole and the higher education sector in particular. We are committed to addressing it through our comprehensive action plan, approved by the University Executive Committee and University Council.  The action plan can be summarised as follows:   For our academics we have introduced new progression and pay review policies to ensure pay is fair and transparent.  For our professional support staff we are reviewing all areas where there is a gender pay gap, such as payments to casual staff, notably with regard to certain jobs undertaken in our colleges.  For all staff , we have reviewed our recruitment practices to ensure we diversify our staff base.   Further details are available on this web page, along with an email address where you can submit comments or queries. We will be updating this website as we progress our plan.
