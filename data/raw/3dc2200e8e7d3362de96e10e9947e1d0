GENDER PAY GAP
2018 RESULTS

From  April  2018  it  is  now  a  UK  Government  requirement  for  companies  with  more  than  250  employees  to  
report their gender pay gap for all legal entities. The gap is based on six separate calculations of the difference 
in the average pay of men and women – regardless of the nature of their work – across the relevant legal entity, 
in our case Red Bull Technology (RBT). This is separate and different from equal pay comparison which involves 
direct comparison of two people or groups of people who carry out the same, similar or equivalent work.

This  is  RBT’s  ﬁrst  report  based  on  the  new  gender  pay  reporting  requirements  and  the  results  are  strongly  
inﬂuenced by the salaries and gender make-up of our business. 

      PAY QUARTILES
We state the percentage of men and women in each of our pay quartiles. The quartiles are calculated by listing 
the rates of pay for each employee across the business - from highest to lowest - then splitting that list into four 
equal sized groups and calculating the percentage of males and females in each group.    Our workforce is 
predominantly  male  which  is  reﬂected  in  each  quartile  by  the  percentage  of  men being greater than the 
percentage of women.

      MEDIAN AND MEAN GAPS CALCULATED FOR  
BOTH SALARY AND BONUSES
     Imagine a picture where all our male employees stood in a line in the order of lowest hourly rate of pay up to 
highest rate of pay. Imagine all our female employees did the same. The median gender gap is the difference 
in hourly pay between the male employee in the exact middle of their line and the female employee in the 
exact middle of their line.

     The mean pay gap is the difference in average hourly rate of pay between all our male employees and all 

our female employees. This measure is strongly affected by the number of men and women in different roles. 
With more men at senior levels our average salary (median or mean) is higher than our average female 
salary. 

     These median and mean calculations are also carried out when comparing bonus pay over a twelve month 

period. The proportion of men and women awarded any bonus pay over that period is also reported.
