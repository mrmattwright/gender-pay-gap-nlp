Gender pay gap legislation was introduced in April 2017; it requires all 
employers of 250 or more to publish their gender pay gap for workers in scope 
as of the 31 March 2017. These results must be published every year no later 
than 30th March each year. 
 
Gender pay reporting is a different requirement to carrying out an equal pay 
audit – it is not a review of equal pay for equal work, it instead compares hourly 
rates of pay and any bonuses staff may receive by gender, seeking to expose any 
imbalances.   
 
The report covers all employees of South Yorkshire Police; it does not cover 
those in the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner. Those included are all 
staff permanently and temporarily employed comprising of officers, police staff 
and PCSO’s in the Force on the reporting snap shot date.   
 
For the purpose of the gender pay gap reporting there can only be one set of data 
presented, however it is useful to break down by the different employment 
groups. Police officer pay scales are determined nationally as is police staff pay 
points up to pay points 43.Executive pay for police staff is determined locally. 
 
The force runs a bonus payment scheme for police officers and staff. The Bonus 
payments are payment of between £50 and £500 may be payable to an 
individuals or team (maximum of £100 per person)  who undertakes one off 
work, which is considered to be of an outstandingly demanding, unpleasant or of 
important nature. Chief Officers do not receive a bonus payment. 
 
We will use the report results to evaluate; 

levels of gender equality in our force 

 
  balance of male and female employees at throughout the force 
  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded 

 

Steps will be taken, where possible, to minimise or readdress any identified 
inequities, it may be several years before any impact is seen. 
 
 
Pay gap calculation 
An employer must publish six calculations showing their: 

1. average gender pay gap as a mean average – the difference between the 
mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of 
full-pay relevant employees. A mean average involves adding up all the 
numbers and dividing the results by how many numbers were listed. 

2. average gender pay gap as a median average – the difference between the 

median hourly rate of pay that male and female full-pay relevant 
employees.  

3. average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average – the difference 

between the mean bonus pay that male and female relevant employees 
receive. 

4. average bonus gender pay gap as a median average – the difference 

between the median bonus pay that make and female relevant 
employees receive. 

5. proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females 
receiving a bonus payment – the proportion of male relevant employees 
who received a bonus payment and the proportion of female relevant 
employees who were paid a bonus. 

6. proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered 
from lowest to highest pay – the proportions of male female employees 
in four quartile pay bands, which is down by dividing the workforce into 
four equal parts.

Work on eradicating the gender pay gap 
We are committed to improving our gender pay gap and are looking at a number 
of initiatives to reduce the differential, these include: 
 

  Active Support for women returning to work following maternity or 

adoption leave. We offer a number of work life balance strategies 
including enhanced shared parental leave, job share and part time 
opportunities, flexi time, time off for dependants and agile working.   

 

 

  Ensure women have the opportunity and ability to progress through their 
careers through talent management schemes. South Yorkshire Police have 
a positive action strategy to support underrepresented groups in policing 
which includes women.  

  The Women’s network actively promotes gender equality and runs 

coaching and mentoring schemes. The network is a key consultation body 
within the force, they also run inspirational events to support women in 
the force. 

 
The above initiatives are building on the foundations of our successes and are 
key in valuing our people, which is one of the building blocks to the forces plan 
on a page.
