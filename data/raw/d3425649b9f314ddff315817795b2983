We publish these results on our own website and submit the figures to the government by 31st March each year.    We use these results to assess:   the level of gender equality in our workplace;  the balance of male and female employees at different levels;  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.     DSAT is committed to the promotion of equality of opportunity and choice for employees and supports the fair treatment of all staff irrespective of gender through our transparent recruitment processes, pay policy, and professional development.  All our posts are aligned to nationally agreed pay scales and our male and female staff are paid within the same band for the same job role.
