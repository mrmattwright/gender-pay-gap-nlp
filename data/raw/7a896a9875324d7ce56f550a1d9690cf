Bühler UK Limited Gender Pay Gap Report 

With more than 250 employees, the Swiss Bühler Group’s UK subsidiary is required to 
publish gender pay gap data in accordance with the new UK government regulations. 

The gender pay gap relates to the difference in the average eanings of men and women 
over a standard period of time, regardless of their role or seniority.  It is not to be confused 
with pay inequality, a different measurement relating to differences in pay between men and 
women carrying out similar jobs or work of equal value.  Bühler UK are confident that males 
and females are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs within our business. 

Whilst we have to report a gender pay gap across our UK business, we face a number of 
challenges in that regard that reflect both the engineering workforce in the UK, where only 
10% of the engineering workforce are females (EEF 2017), and wider issues in UK society.  
We are well above the EEF figure, with 19.9% female staff, and are continually striving to 
encourage more females into our business, at shop-floor, undergraduate and graduate entry 
level and in management.
