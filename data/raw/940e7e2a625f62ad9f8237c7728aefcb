Achieving Extraordinary Things                     Congratulations to our CEO  Congratulations to our CEO, Julia Kedwards on her OBE for services to Education, awarded in the New Year Honours List 2018.  Find Out More                     The Northampton Primary Academy Trust Partnership (NPAT) is a collaboration of eight great primary schools in Northampton. With responsibility for approximately 3100 children across Northampton, NPAT is driven by a vision to achieve educational excellence, creating opportunities and enriching lives.  This approach is encapsulated in our motto:  ‘Achieving Extraordinary Things’  NPAT schools all share this common vision and are committed to shared values, whilst retaining the freedom to innovate and develop their own identity and character.                   Introduction from Julia Kedwards CEO, Northampton Primary Academy Trust  NPAT was established in 2012 by five Headteachers with a vision to provide exceptional learning opportunities for our family of primary schools in Northampton. Our passion for future educational provision to be driven by outstanding primary practice, along with a belief that children must remain at the heart of every decision made by our leaders at all levels, led us to evolve NPAT into a successful Trust where we encourage our children, staff and friends to ‘Achieve Extraordinary Things’.  Through our links with partner agencies such as the Royal Shakespeare Company, Microsoft and Create Development our schools demonstrate exemplary practice in sport, dance, drama, the arts and technology. We aim to ensure that our children can achieve the highest academic standards at the same time as enjoying a rich, challenging and relevant curriculum, which focuses on their personal development and prepares them for their place in the wider world.  Great schools need great leaders and great staff, and NPAT schools pride themselves on attracting and retaining the best people to work in and lead our schools. The Trust provides a range of professional development opportunities for staff including training, NPAT network groups, bespoke consultant support and our annual NPAT Governance and Teaching conferences.  Having spent years ensuring that our schools are ‘great’ and defining our approaches to learning and teaching, we are now beginning our growth plan with a view to becoming a local Trust of 12-15 schools. This is an exciting time for NPAT and I am extremely proud to be working with the exceptional group of professionals and the amazing children and parents that make up NPAT.
