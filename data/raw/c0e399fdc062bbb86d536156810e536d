Gender Pay Gap Report 2017   Under new legislation that came into force in April 2017, UK employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish their gender pay gap in order to show how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. The two B&M Care Group companies of B&M Investments Ltd and Colleycare Ltd trade as B&M Care and are reported separately as required.    Headline gender pay figures – the information shows our median and mean gender pay gap and bonus pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017 and bonuses paid in the year to 5 April 2017.   Our workforce is made up of significantly more female than male staff, a profile reflecting the current nature of the social care sector.  In our case this is reflected across all of the pay quartiles.    The differences between B&M Investments Ltd and Colleycare Ltd are because Colleycare Ltd figures include the Group’s Head Office Team which encompasses the Executive Management Team, Board Directors and a small in-house team of professionals who manage the design, development, construction and facilities management of the Groups Care Homes. Our Board of Directors is 60% female.    We believe in being an inclusive and diverse organization where everyone has an equal opportunity to reach their full potential.    I confirm that the data reported is accurate.
