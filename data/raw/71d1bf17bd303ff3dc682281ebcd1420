GENDER PAY GAP REPORT – Data based on 05/04/2017  Foreword  At The heart of The Stable are our people, a business born in Dorset which now operates from 17 sites from Falmouth to Whitechapel and Bridport to Birmingham. We are a restaurant company specialising in artisan pizza and craft ciders with a passion for local produce and having a good time.  As we have grown from humble beginnings in 2009 with the original Stable in Bridport to present day, our teams have come along with us. Over 30 employees have become “CiderMasters” and over 20 employees are social media gurus as the roles have evolved in the last couple of years.  We are happy to share the detail of our gender pay gap report as well as our plans to help close the gender gap.  Understanding our Pay Gap  The Stable median hourly pay gap is 8.3% higher for men. The mean hourly pay gap is 12.7% higher for men.  The median bonus gap is 125% higher for women, and the mean bonus gap is 81.2% higher for women. This is for two reasons, firstly a higher percentage of women received a bonus than men in 2017, and secondly our senior management team (which has a higher bonus potential) comprises 57% women.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in average pay between women and men. Our Gender pay gaps result from a higher number of head chefs and general managers in roles that pay more.  We are not alone in this and understand that this is an issue throughout our industry. That said, we believe we compare well with other comparator organisations. The average UK mean differential is 17.4%, while for the Retail Sector this rises to 18.4%. However, we are not complacent and have implemented a number of initiatives, actions and programmes to reduce our gender pay gap.  Closing our Pay Gap  Our ambition is to close the gap. To achieve this, we are committed to delivering initiatives to improve how we attract, engage and develop women as well as other under-represented groups.  As the business has grown we have set aside more time and resource to develop our recruitment process, induction and job roles within our organisation.  As the Founders move away from the business we have created a senior team which comprises 57% women.  Our team of cider experts, ’CiderMasters,’ was originally very male dominated, we have now seen this increase to 35% women, and we are confident that this will appeal more and more to women in our workforce. Our ‘CiderMasters’ receive a bonus payment.  Our Social Media Gurus are responsible for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram posts for our restaurants. 65% of these are women and they also receive a bonus payment.
