Introduction 

A  privately  owned  British  company,  Kanes  Foods  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  the 
prepared produce industry for many years. We are BRC AA* accredited and believe 
we  have  the  best  salad  factory  in  Europe,  investing  in  advanced  technologies  to 
achieve  growth  for  our  customers  through  exciting  innovation  and  category 
expansion.  

Our mission is to make the very best prepared fresh produce for Britain’s consumers so 
that  everyone  can  choose  to  eat  healthily  without  compromise  –  healthy  choices 
made easy. 

 

Our people are what makes Kanes special and everyone at Kanes Foods is committed 
to  developing  healthy  meal  solutions  that  give  shoppers  greater  choice  without 
compromising on taste or quality. 

Based in the Vale of Evesham, a region renowned for growing great fresh produce, 
we  produce  an  extensive  range  of  washed  and  ready  to  eat  salads,  fresh  stir  fry 
vegetable  mixes,  fresh  noodles,  prepared  vegetables,  stir  fry  sauces  and  salad 
dressings. 

 

 

Gender Pay Gap Calculations 

Across  Kanes,  our  mean  gender  pay 
gap is 11.3%. We are encouraged that 
this  is  lower  than  the  current  national 
mean pay gap (17.4%) and that for the 
food manufacturing sector (14.5%).

However,  we  know  we  have  more  to 
do  at  we  can  do  to  promote  diversity 
and  embed  a  culture  of  gender 
equality within our business. 

In common with most employers with a 
pay gap, the main reason for the gap 
is  the  balance  between  men  and 
women in senior roles and this is clearly 
reflected  in  our  highest  paid  quartile 
data.  

Across  our  Executive  Team  and  Senior 
Management Team, 31.5% are women 
and this has increased from 21% in 2016. 

 

We  have  specifically  focused  on  this 
area to ensure that women are not only 
treated  fairly,  but  that  they  are  also 
given 
and 
encouragement to progress into senior 
roles.

We  have  more  to  do  in  this  area  to 
ensure we attract, develop and retain 
high quality female managers, and we 
will  develop  and  pursue  a  rigorous 
programme to address this.
