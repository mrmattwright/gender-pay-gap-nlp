Mean and Median Gender Pay Gaps:
Our Mean Gender Pay Gap is -2.4%. 
This means NPH’s female employees are paid on average 2.4% higher than men.

The mean is calculated by adding all the hourly rates of pay and dividing them by the 
number of staff.  The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly rate 
of pay for full-pay relevant male employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees. 
The result for NPH shows a very small pay gap compared to the national average of 18.4%.

Our Median Gender Pay Gap is -2.9%.
This means NPH’s female employees are paid on average 2.9% higher than men.

The median is calculated by arranging all hourly rates of pay in order from the highest to 
the lowest and selecting the middle value. The median gender pay gap is the difference 
between the median hourly rate of pay for full-pay relevant male employees and that 
of female full-pay relevant employees. The result for NPH shows a very small pay gap 
compared to the national average of 18.4%.

More about Northampton Partnership Homes 
and our gender pay gap report

The split between male and female employees across the Upper, Upper Middle, and Lower 
quartile pay bands show an almost equal split.

The Lower quartile shows a higher proportion of males. The Lower quartile includes a 
majority of our Property Maintenance Trade Workers.  Our Trade Workers are all male and 
we are looking at ways to attract more females into these roles.

The low gender pay gap at Northampton Partnership Homes demonstrates our 
commitment to equal pay.  We will be clear and transparent about our gender pay gap with 
our employees, Board, tenants, partners, and our communities.

The data in this report is accurate and in line with mandatory reporting regulations.
