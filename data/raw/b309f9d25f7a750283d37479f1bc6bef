Across the WLT Group on average our females’ base salaries are 5% higher than our males’. (Jan 2018)  Specifically, Williams Lea Tag UK has analysed the gaps in pay across all grades with the following findings and in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, we are pleased to share our findings:   In the UK overall we have 62% of males and 38% females in our workforce. In the EMEA Regional Board, we are proud that we have we 40% of females holding leadership positions which is representative of our overall population.    As we have a higher proportion of males in senior positions compared to females, this accounts for 7.2% of the mean pay gap across the UK.    Our overall median pay gap is 8.5% which compares favourably to the National median pay gap of 9.1% (Office for the National Statistics published 2017).    We see a smaller mean pay gap where we have a more equal balance of gender particularly in senior grades.      We acknowledge that we need to do more to reduce the pay gap and the following initiatives will help us achieve this:   We will continue to work on our recruitment strategies to ensure that a female candidate is shortlisted for every management role.    We will train managers to be aware of diversity differences in interviewing and selection.    We will establish development programs and mentoring support for our female talent.    For networking and development events we will target a proportional gender split aligned to our workforce.    By the end of 2019 we will aim to increase female representation in management grades by 5%, which will also affect the bonus pay gap.    We continue to leverage our career architecture, which has been rolled out in the past twelve months enabling us to improve pay transparency and application of our reward policies       Let's Talk.
