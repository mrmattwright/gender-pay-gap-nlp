Gender Pay
Report

TTS Group Limited

Gender Pay Reporting

TTS Group Ltd (“TTS”) is part of the RM Resources Division 
of RM plc (“RM”), alongside The Consortium for Purchasing 
and Distribution Ltd (acquired by RM on 30 June 2017).  
RM Resources provides education resources and supplies 
used in UK and international schools and early years 
establishments.

The workforce is a mix of distribution centre roles and 
supporting functions such as Customer Services, Sales, 
Marketing, Finance, HR and IT.

The Gender Pay reporting regulations require all UK legal 
entities with over 250 employees to publish the following 
sets of data annually:

•  Mean and median gender pay gap (hourly earnings)

•  Mean and median gender bonus gap 

(for those receiving a bonus)

•  Proportion of men and women that received a bonus

•  Proportion of men and women working in different 

pay quartiles 

As at April 2017, TTS employed less than 250 employees.  
However, we have chosen to publish the figures for each 
trading entity within the RM Group. 

This data is designed to look at the difference in the average 
pay of men and women regardless of their role or level 
within the Company.  This is different to Equal Pay which 
focuses on equal pay for equal work.

Bonus pay gap 48.2% 31.3%

 
There is a small difference in the pay gap which is 
favourable to females, which is as a result of a gender 
balanced workforce and females being well represented at 
all quartiles within TTS.

The bonus gap is largely driven by the payment of 
share‑based awards. Whilst more women than men received 
the awards the largest payment went to the male MD.
