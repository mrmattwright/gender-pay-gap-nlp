However, G&P are not immune to the skills challenges faced across the Automotive sector. The industry has historically been male dominated with less than 10% of the UK engineering workforce consisting of women. G&P’s workforce consists of roughly 20% women, well above this industry average. Like many Automotive organisations, due to the lack of available applicants we struggle to recruit women into some higher paid positions, which is reflected within our figures. Despite this G&P’s mean and median figures of 11% and 2.9% respectively are extremely positive when compared with the figures across the wider UK economy of 18.4% and 9.1%. G&P’s figures are also well below our sector’s average pay gap of 20%, further underling the lack of influence gender has on pay at G&P. We are proud to be involved in promoting gender diversity within the Automotive industry. In 2018 we will be continuing to offer support for women returning from maternity leave by offering flexible working arrangements to increase their chances of career progression. Outlined below is a detailed breakdown G&P’s current pay gap statistics:   Mean gender pay gap: 11.0%  Median gender pay gap: 2.9%  Mean gender bonus gap: 0%  Median gender bonus gap: 0%   Employees by Pay quartile     Upper Quartile  Percentage  Upper Middle   Lower Middle   Lower Quartile     Male  79.4%  Male  70.6%  Male  70.6%  Male  86.8%    Female  20.6%  Female  29.4%  Female  29.4%  Female  17.6%       The figures listed within this report are a true and accurate representation of the composition and breakdown of pay differences within G&P’s workforce. G&P is an equal opportunities employer, who offers equal pay regardless of gender.
