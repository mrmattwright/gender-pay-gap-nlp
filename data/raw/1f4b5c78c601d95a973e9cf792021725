Equal pay relates to what male and female employees are paid for the same or similar jobs or work of equal value. There is a distinct difference between gender pay gap and equal pay.  This report has been published in accordance with Gender Pay Gap Reporting (GPGR) regulations under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations. The regulations require companies to report GPGR statistics for separate legal entities in Great Britain with more than 250 employees. This report contains data for the entity of CEMEX UK Operations Ltd which employs approximately 2,800 employees across our different businesses including Cement, Readymix, Aggregates, Building Products and support functions. The snapshot date for the data is 5 April 2017.  The report focuses on 6 key elements:   Mean gender pay gap  Median gender pay gap  Mean bonus pay gap  Median bonus pay gap  The proportion of males and females who received a bonus  The proportion of males and females in each pay quartile   The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the average of male and female hourly pay. The median gender pay gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of male and female hourly pay.  The method of calculating this information has been outlined by the UK Government and our results will continue to be published on our CEMEX website.  CEMEX has a robust process to ensure that we are fair and consistent with our pay levels. We conduct an annual review each year which requires senior operational managers and HR to approve and sign off.   Gender Pay Gap Results  UK Workforce        Mean Pay Gap  4.6%    Median Pay Gap  1.2%    The gender pay gap is largely due to that fact that our workforce is predominantly male. This is in-line with the demographics seen in the wider construction and building materials sectors which have historically struggled to attract women.   Pay Quartiles     Gender Bonus Gap Results   Mean Bonus Cap  16.7%    Median Bonus Cap  17.7%     Proportion of workforce that received bonus payment    The gender pay gap exists as a result of our workforce being predominantly male. This is in line with the demographics seen in the wider construction and building materials sectors which have historically struggled to attract females.  The mean and median bonus pay gaps are driven by a lower proportion of females in senior management positions. Senior management roles have higher bonus targets and include long term share incentive plans which are factored into the bonus gap calculations.  We recognise that we need to promote and develop more females into leadership and senior management positions. Our initiatives are summarised further on in this report.  Bonus payments were received by 92.9% of females and 97.1% of males. The majority of our employees are on the General Bonus scheme which is paid in arrears in the April of the following year. Employees who joined CEMEX in December or after would not have been entitled to the bonus payment. The bonus calculations are based on bonus payments made in the 12 months to 5 April 2017 as specified by the regulations.                                             Work in progress to promote more females into our industry  CEMEX seeks to increase gender diversity in leadership positions by achieving higher female representation by 2020 with more females in leadership positions.

There are also other important initiatives underway aimed to improve gender equality;

Our CEMEX UK Country President Michel Andre has communicated his vision to have more females in leadership positions and recognises that there is a lot to do.

Encouraging more females, not only into CEMEX but also into our industry remains a challenge. It is a historical characteristic of our industry that we have a higher proportion of male employees particularly in roles such as engineering and production.

CEMEX is taking positive action however to improve gender equality in the UK and across the global organisation.             Diversity Working Committee  CEMEX UK is in the process of establishing a working party whose objective will be to identify and share best practice diversity initiatives. These initiatives are aimed at addressing challenges such as work life balance, benefits and career development opportunities for females.

We have established links with the Women’s Leadership Forum based at Harvard Business School which is helping us to explore how best to design a 3 year strategy to increase female leadership at CEMEX – learning examples of best practices on gender equality design.

CEMEX globally has also established a Diversity Working party to review initiatives in other countries in order to share best practices taking place globally. Our CEO Fernando Gonzalez has been meeting with female executives from across the global organisation to discuss how we can make our business more attractive to female recruits.             Employee Value Propositions  We have adopted the process of segmenting our UK workforce in order to create Value Propositions and this methodology is helping us to really understand the needs and wants of our female employees.

We have interviewed a number of our female colleagues from across various different businesses and the information is helping us to design ‘Value Propositions’ aimed at attracting more females when recruiting and providing development opportunities for females within our business.

Our UK website contains video testimonials from females in Commercial, Operational, Logistics, Financial and HR roles. They speak about their experiences working for CEMEX highlighting the investment in their personal development, leading to career advancement amongst many other positive examples of being a female in CEMEX.             Graduate Recruitment Programme  CEMEX plans to operate a graduate recruitment programme with a target to recruit 50% male and 50% female graduate intake in the next 12 months to address gender diversity talent and succession planning needs.        CEMEX Human Rights Self Assessment  CEMEX conducts a Human Rights Self Assessment aimed at identifying, preventing and mitigating adverse impacts on our ‘stake holders’ human rights across all countries. This effort is to identify human rights risks to avoid their occurrence or enable their remediation while establishing a regular monitoring process.

The assessment is based on international human rights standards and protocols. This assessment addresses Equality at work, Non-discrimination, Equal recognition and protection under the law, Compensation & Work-life balance, Family life, Rest and leisure, Education and adequate standard of living.
