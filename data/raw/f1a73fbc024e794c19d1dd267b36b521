We are pleased to have approximately 25% of our workforce holding 10 years’ service or longer. Our aim is to be the employer of choice for the motor trade in the South West, offering career opportunities to both males and females, supported by the fact that many management positions currently held were filled through internal development and progression. The government required statistics are produced below in blue text together with our commentary to help explain what they mean.  It is widely recognised that these measures show the gender pay gap (differences in the average pay between men and women) and do not measure equal pay (i.e. whether men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value are paid the same).  In short, the fact that a large proportion of our workforce is male and that they hold a large percentage of the higher paying roles is what causes our gender pay gap. We are committed to equal pay.  Where two people undertake the same role and responsibilities they have the opportunity to earn the same pay with performance, of course, also affecting earnings.  We operate consistent group wide pay structures for many common roles to facilitate this. It comes as no surprise at all that a gender pay gap exists within the prescribed statistics below - the motor trade has for many years been a male dominated industry in respect of workforce, which we cannot change alone.  Our reported gender pay gap compares favourably when compared with the most recently published government national statistic of 18.4% [1] . We believe the group’s family ownership and family values promote a working environment which is conducive to both male and female employees.  We are open to job applications from applicants of all diversities and are committed to offering equal opportunity to both male and female job applicants. We believe that it will be possible to learn much from this first ever round of gender pay reporting and we will monitor the employment market to ensure that we keep pace with suitable initiatives to remove the historic male stereotype which is applied to the motor retail sector. We want to attract and recruit the very best talent into our business, regardless of gender. Required statistics Mean gender pay gap – 16.2% - this shows the difference between the mean (average) hourly rate of pay that male and female employees receive. Median Pay gap – 18.3% - this shows the difference between the median (midpoint) hourly rate of pay that male and female employees receive. Mean bonus gender pay gap – 63.6% - this shows the difference between the mean (average) bonus pay that male and female employees receive. Median bonus gender pay gap – 70.7% - this shows the difference between the median (midpoint) bonus pay that male and female employees receive. Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment – 76.4% Proportion of females receiving a bonus payment – 70.7% Proportion of males and female in each quartile pay band - shows the proportions of male and female employees in four quartile pay bands, which is done by dividing the workforce into four equal parts Pay   band quartile Male Female Lower quartile 78.8% 21.2% Lower middle quartile 66.9% 33.1% Upper middle quartile 87.0% 13.0% Upper quartile 94.5% 5.5% I confirm that these published figures are an accurate account of our gender pay gap as at April 2017.
