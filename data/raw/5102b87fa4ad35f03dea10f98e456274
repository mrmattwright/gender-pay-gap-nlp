Calculations from data taken as at 5 April 2017 are considered to be accurate and are as follows:   Nick Burrows Chief Executive Officer    * Women’s hourly rate is 18.52% lower (mean) and 0.14% lower (median) than men’s hourly rate. * The distribution of male and female employees at each pay quartile shows; - Top quartile 49.7% male and 50.3% female - Upper middle quartile 33.2% male and 66.8% female - Lower middle quartile 28.4% male and 71.6% female - Lower quartile 42.7% male and 57.3% female * In line with the definitions within the Gender Pay Gap reporting requirement, 29.14% of male employees and 33.99% of female employees received a bonus. * Women’s bonus pay is 78.66% lower (mean) and 34.34% lower (median) than men’s bonus pay.   Background information about Notcutts At the time the data was taken the company employed 1,239 people, of which 61.5% were female and 38.5% were male. * 40% of our Board is female; * Since 2015 our Board chair has been female; * Since April 2017 we have recruited two additional female Executive Team members, taking the current total to four which represents 40% of the total Executive Team; * At April 2017, 3 of our Garden Centre Managers were female.
