+ Our median hourly gender pay gap is 0% with our mean gap being 1.9%
+ 70% of our employees are on fixed hourly rates working in roles in our stores, and this has a

significant impact on our gender pay gap outcome.

+ 11.8% of employees received a bonus in the relevant period. Bonus in this context includes: a
quarterly retail management incentive, a distribution centre productivity bonus, and a long
term incentive payment. Our annual bonus for support centre employees did not pay out in
the period.

+ The relatively large size of the mean bonus gap is due to the vesting of a small number of long
term awards in the period which were awarded to 3 senior employees as a result of GAME
Digital’s IPO in 2014, with the size of these awards reflected in the difference between the
mean and median outcome.

For the future, the Company is focused on both ensuring that the positive gender pay gap
outcome is not taken for granted by further reviewing and improving the pay gap in individual
areas of the business, and increasing the proportion of women in each pay quartile, as we
recognise the importance of increasing diversity across GAME to better reflect our community of
gamers,
I can confirm that the data reported above is 
accurate
