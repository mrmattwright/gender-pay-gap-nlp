The Equality and Human Rights Commission has identified a number of ways in which employers may continue to address any gaps. Having reviewed these, we have developed the following action points:   We will continue to refine our recruitment materials, sources and practices to reduce any gender bias within the recruitment process.  Ensure flexible working practices, we already have in place, are applied fairly across all levels of roles, subject to fulfilling the organisation’s needs.  We will look at how our flexible working practices operate across the organisation and address any barriers that are identified.  Review policies and practices that support childcare or other caring responsibilities to ensure equal support is available to men and women to undertake them.    Focus on developing initiatives which support internal promotions and open up more opportunities in the lower quartiles.  Review working practices in our lowest paid jobs.  Continue to develop and expand on our Future leaders program which has a key place in our employee learning and development curriculum   Rob Payne  Chief Executive Officer          Our partners                                Track your journey  Download our app        Visit us on Facebook    Visit us on Twitter    Visit us on YouTube    Visit us on Instagram          Contact Us    Sitemap    Privacy Policy    Terms & Conditions    FAQs    Careers    Design by Prodo Digital
