RIDER LEVETT BUCKNALL UK
GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

FOREWORD

At Rider Levett Bucknall (RLB) we believe that we all have a responsibility to support the communities in 
which we live and work and that our workforce should be representative of these communities. This belief is 
central to our commitment to raise awareness of, and embed improvements around, equality, diversity and 
inclusion (EDI).

It is widely acknowledged that there is a challenge facing the construction industry around EDI, and this 
includes female underrepresentation.  This underrepresentation is particularly evident at senior levels, and our 
own figures reflect this. Attracting and retaining a diverse workforce is a business priority, intensified by the 
skills-crisis affecting our industry. 

Ann Bentley
Global Board Director

At RLB we are playing our part to overcome the bias across the industry by recruiting a more diverse 
workforce. This includes encouraging more women into construction, implementing policies which encourage 
women (and men) to stay in the industry, developing female leaders, and implementing succession 
programmes.

RLB’s values include leading by example and shaping the future of our industry. In line with these values we 
are developing our workforce and equipping them with the skills they will need to thrive, as the demands of 
the industry change. We are driving progress across many fronts. Our Future Professionals Programme is 
one example – where we are engaging with schools and colleges to target and attract a more representative 
workforce of tomorrow. You can read more about this and other RLB initiatives later in this report.

We are encouraged by the Government’s pledge to close the gender pay gap, and at RLB we commit to 
increasing both the representation of women as a whole and the proportion of women in senior positions.

Over the last 5 years our overall proportion of female staff has risen to 27% - compared to an industry 
average of 12.8%1. Deeper analysis shows that 46% of our lower quartile roles and 8% of our most senior roles 
are now carried out by women. Our objective is to ensure that this momentum is maintained and we have set 
the target of 40% of all our staff and 20% of our most senior roles being filled by women by 2025. Whilst we 
recognise that there is more to do, we are continuing to take positive steps to develop an inclusive workplace 
with a diverse workforce.

A FRESH PERSPECTIVE

We know that doing the right thing matters. 
We go beyond just saying so and take action to 
prove it. We are committed to gender equality 
and to providing fair and equal opportunities 
for everyone to achieve success. 

Our culture is based on an open, inclusive 
and respectful environment where everyone 
receives equal treatment in all aspects of 
employment policies and practices.

Gender Pay Gap Reporting 

As an organisation with in excess of 250 
employees Rider Levett Bucknall is required to 
report the overall gender pay gap between all 
men and women. 

This report sets out some of our findings 
and our plans. Our gender pay results are 
summarised on pages 9 and 10.

REWARDING FAIRLY 

Rider Levett Bucknall has reviewed the overall 
data and also reviewed it by role and job level. 
While understanding that this is a Gender Pay 
Gap report and not an Equal Pay Audit we 
have found no variation in the salaries of men 
and women by grade from our more detailed 
analysis.

By engaging in an annual external salary 
review across industry, which examines the 
alignment of salary bandings and ranges, 
we are confident that men and women 
receive appropriate competitive pay for roles 
performed.  Our internal annual salary review 
process includes rigorous review of pay across 
the business and also concludes that RLB 
provides equal pay for equal work, regardless 
of gender. 

We are proud to have been Equality Assured 
for 7 consecutive years, to be a signatory to 
the RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark, and 
to be Living Wage accredited.

SHAPING THE FUTURE

Current representation across RLB is 27% 
women and 73% men, with 8% women at 
senior levels. This report sets out some of our 
findings and what we are doing to change it. 
While there are women represented across all 
quartiles, it is clear that as we move through 
to the higher quartiles the representation of 
women decreases. To help readdress this issue 
we have introduced a number of retention and 
succession initiatives. 

These include our Leadership and 
Management programme to develop 
contemporary, transformational leaders as 
well as supporting the promotion of women 
into more senior roles (the 2017/2018 group 
stands at 60% men / 40% women). 

RLB’s Futures Board provides a platform for 
young leaders to develop alongside senior 
mentors and female representation accounts 
for over 35%.

BUILDING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE

Our initiatives encourage returners and new 
starters to the industry to progress and we 
are targeting a higher representation of 
women at all levels.  These include: 

We are targeting and actively engaging 
with both primary and secondary schools 
and colleges across the UK to promote 
careers in construction.

Our David Bucknall Scholarship provides 
financial assistance and support to 
construction students and is now in its third 
year. To date women have made up  

Recruitment - all our agencies are required 
to provide a diverse selection of candidates 
for review to ensure broader EDI including 
gender representation.

Our Bucknall’s First Rung initiative, led by 
our graduates, encourages NEETS (Not in 
Education, Employment or Training) into 
the construction industry.
