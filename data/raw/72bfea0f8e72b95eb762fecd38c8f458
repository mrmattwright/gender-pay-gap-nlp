GENDER PAY  
GAP REPORT

INTRODUCTION

At Carbon60, we welcome  
the opportunity to share our 
gender pay gap as it will help 
us have more meaningful 
conversations with our people  
and our customers about  
equality, diversity and inclusion. 

Carbon60 has an overall median 
gender pay gap of 4.56%. Of the 
people included in the calculations, 
80% are temporary workers whose 
pay is fixed by our customers.  
In the interests of full disclosure, 
we have also chosen to provide  
an analysis of our 145 permanent 
UK employees. 

Among Carbon60’s people our 
median gender pay gap is 25%. 
Our pay structure equally rewards 
men and women performing  
the same roles, yet women are 
under-represented in senior 
management and in high  
bonus-earning sales roles, which 
impacts upon our gender pay gap. 

The staffing, engineering, 
construction and aviation sectors 
attract fewer women than men. 

Therefore, given that Carbon60 
specialises in these areas, this 
combination compounds our 
gender pay gap. Just 9% of the 
UK’s engineering workforce is 
female, according to the Women  
in Engineering Society; only 35%  
of girls study STEM subjects past 
the age of 16, compared to 94%  
of boys, and it is these societal 
imbalances that impact on our 
candidate pools.

We have made good progress 
with diversity and inclusion at 
Carbon60 and understanding  
our gender pay gap drives us  
to do more.

We are committed to improving 
the gender balance of our senior 
managers, which is key to tackling 
our gender pay gap.

We are investing in a range of 
initiatives to bring about change 
and this report outlines more detail 
about what we are undertaking as 
part of a broader focus on creating 
a more inclusive workplace.

Carbon60 Gender Pay Gap ReportUNDERSTANDING  
THE GENDER PAY GAP 

GENDER PAY VS EQUAL PAY 

A gender pay gap shows the difference in average  
pay across all of the men and women in an organisation,  
industry or country as a whole. It can be driven by the 
differing number of men and women across all roles. 

It is not the same as an equal pay comparison which  
looks at how much men and women are paid for  
doing the same role. 

HOW WE CALCULATED  
OUR NUMBERS

Under the UK Government’s new Gender Pay Gap regulation, 
companies need to report their gender pay gap for all legal 
entities in Great Britain with more than 250 employees.  
We have provided data on all of our permanent and 
temporary employees, as required by the regulation. 

Given that we are a staffing business we have a very high 
number of temporary workers on our payrolls at any one 
time. This number fluctuates depending on requirements 
from our clients, and typically the rate of pay that our 
temporary workers receive is decided by our clients.  
We have also reported on our permanent employees 
only and our temporary employees only. 

PAY QUARTILES EXPLAINED

A pay quartile is calculated by listing the hourly pay rates  
for everyone in the business then dividing them in to four 
equal sized groups. We then work out the percentage  
of men and women in each group. 

MEAN AND MEDIAN  
GAPS EXPLAINED

The figure used most regularly is the median gender pay 
gap. To help bring this to life, imagine all of the women at 
Impellam standing in one line, from lowest paid by hour to 
highest, and all of the men doing the same in another line. 
The median gender pay gap is the percentage difference  
in hourly pay between the woman in the middle of the line 
and the man in the middle of the line. Hourly pay includes 
leave and any shift premiums, but not overtime.

LOWEST PAID

MEDIAN

HIGHEST PAID

The mean gender pay gap is the percentage difference  
in the average pay of men and women. This is calculated  
by adding up all of the hourly pay rates for all of the women 
in a business and dividing it by the number of women,  
then doing the same for the men and comparing the 
difference. The mean can be affected by different numbers 
of men and women in different roles. This is why we  
also report the number of men and women in different  
pay quartiles. 

We also report the median and mean differences in bonus 
pay over a twelve month period, and the percentage  
of men and women who received a bonus. 

A positive percentage shows a gap in favour of men;  
a negative percentage shows a gap in favour of women.

in support and administrative roles that  
don’t tend to attract bonuses.

Carbon60 Gender Pay Gap ReportHOW WE ARE BUILDING 
AN INCLUSIVE BUSINESS

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse business built on trust, and the following initiatives  
support our goals:

 WE SUPPORT A DIVERSITY 
AND INCLUSION NETWORK

4.   WE FACILITATE CONVERSATIONS 

AROUND FLEXIBLE WORKING

1. 

 

 As part of the Impellam Group, we participate actively 
in the Diversity and Inclusion network which fosters  
an inclusive and diverse workforce by encouraging 
positive conversations that drive clear action.

 

2.   WE ARE BUILDING A CULTURE  

OF VIRTUOSITY

 

 We continue to invest in our Virtuoso programme 
which recognises that it is our managers who make 
the difference in building trust, relationships and better 
futures for our clients and our people. This focus on 
Virtuosity is central to our strategy and frees our 
managers from conventional thinking so they see  
new possibilities, enabling our people to realise  
their full potential and to thrive.

3.   WE ADDRESS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS 

 

 All our people take and have access to training via  
our online learning system to help them understand, 
identify and address unconscious bias. We also offer 
this training to our customers as and when appropriate.

 We are an inclusive business, and we encourage 
flexibility, including part-time work and home working. 
We hold conversations with managers through Open 
Blend, our coaching and development platform, which 
enables us to explore whether personal ambitions are 
being met, as well as business objectives. By addressing 
the whole person, we will create a more engaged, 
productive workforce that allows our people to  
be their authentic selves at work.

5.   WE SUPPORT WOMEN  
RETURNING TO WORK 

 

 We have increased our maternity leave payments  
to encourage women to return to work. Since then,  
86% have returned after maternity leave. We will ensure 
all our employees are aware of their rights and options 
around parental leave.
