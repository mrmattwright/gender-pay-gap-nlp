Laleham are pleased to comply with these new regulations and are committed to equal opportunities in employment.  The gender pay gap measures the average pay difference between men and women in a company. It should not be confused with equal pay, which instead looks at the pay difference between men and women who occupy similar jobs or work of equal value.  We are confident that men and women at Laleham are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. However, we have a fairly diverse workforce, with a 60:40 split between males and females, with a higher representation of females in the lower paid jobs, particularly as production line operators. The impact of this demographic effect contributes to the pay and bonus gap outlined below.  What impacts the gender pay and bonus gap at Laleham?  The demographics of our workforce is the key factor in shaping our gender pay gaps. The key driving factors are:   Fewer women in the senior management / leadership roles in the organisation.   A relatively higher representation of women than men in lower paid production operative roles.  The management bonus plans are structured as a % of salary, therefore as more men are in higher-paid management roles the mean and median bonus gap is greater.    Addressing any levels of gender inequality in our workplace.  Understanding the balance of males and females at different levels and functions.  Identifying appropriate actions to promote diversity.
