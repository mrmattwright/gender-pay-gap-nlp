We are pleased to share Webhelp’s 
gender pay gap report with our 
mean gender pay gap of 9.1%. This 
will be published annually as part of 
the new UK legislation that came 
into effect from 6 April 2017.  

Webhelp is a 40,000 people strong 
global leader in business process 
outsourcing (BPO) and we have 
been in business since 2000. We 
continue to grow each year by 
leading the way in our industry 
through innovation, 
transformational performance 
improvement for our clients, and 
creating an environment which 
fosters growth, development and 
the engagement of our employees.  

Our Webhelp gender pay report 
aims to outline our results but also 
our ongoing commitment to 
continue on the journey to being 
inclusive, fair and progressive in our 
approach to recruitment, 

Webhelp - who we are…. 
Webhelp has approx. 6,000 roles in the UK with nearly 95% of these working in 
operational roles, interacting directly with our clients and customers. 
Approximately 5% of colleagues are in specialist roles within the support functions. 
We have an overall gender split of 51.3% women and 48.6% men.  

There are various types of roles in operations ranging from advisors, assisting our 
customers, to senior operational leaders who are responsible for overseeing an 
entire site working with a number of different teams.  

Our support roles cover 26 diverse specialist functions with roles from entry level 
specialist roles in areas such as IT, finance, and recruitment to our most senior 
roles at executive board level. For the purposes of reporting our gender pay 
results we took into account every full pay relevant employee and are illustrated 
across this page. 

Overall our mean gender pay gap is 9.1%. However, splitting our people into the 
two distinct areas of operations and support, our mean gender pay gap for those 
parts of the business in isolation are -0.2% and 33.8% respectively. The lower gap 
in operations demonstrates that we only have a minimal gender pay gap with an 
equal distribution of men and women across operational roles (48.1% Male / 
51.9% Female). This is evidence of the approach we take to ensure that all levels 
of the operational business have the same roles offering the same salary. The 
larger gap in support demonstrates that there are more men in specialist support 
roles which attract higher pay (58.5% Male / 41.5% Female). 

The mean gender pay gap in support is much higher at 33.8% as this includes a 
variety of roles up to and including our most senior executive board roles, each 
having very different remuneration packages. With regard to female 
representation on boards in the UK, the average is less than 25%.  Webhelp’s 
female representation on the board stands at over 28% and this is an area that we 
will continue to develop. 

There are a number of senior Webhelp Group employees living in the UK however 
holding global roles. For the purpose of the legislation they have been included 
however if we were to exclude these non UK dedicated roles our mean gender pay 
gap would reduce to 7.3%.

Gender Pay Gap 

The majority of organisations have a gender 
pay gap, and we are pleased to be able to 
say that Webhelp is below the average mean 
gender pay gap in the UK, including most 
organisations within our industry. 

Webhelp is committed to the principle of 
equal opportunities and equal treatment for 
all employees, regardless of sex, race, 
religion or belief, age, marriage or civil 
partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual 
orientation, gender reassignment or 
disability. 

We have a clear policy of paying employees 
equally for the same or equivalent work, 
regardless of their sex (or any other 
characteristic set out above). We: 

•

•

•

schedule monthly meetings with the 
remuneration committee consisting of 
members of our executive team and the 
people team to review and formalise 
decisions involving pay and benefits in a 
fair, non-discriminatory way; 

conduct an annual salary review process 
in a transparent manner; 

have job roles and pay grades in place to 
demonstrate a clear structure. 

We are confident that our gender pay gap 
does not stem from paying men and women 
differently for the same or equivalent work. 
Rather our gender pay gap is the result of a 
range of specialist roles in support functions 
ranging in seniority and the higher 
benchmarked salaries and benefits packages 
that these roles attract in the market. 

We can demonstrate that we are a diverse 
and inclusive company supported with 
relevant People Policies and equal pay 
throughout the company. Policies are in 
place covering maternity, paternity and 
shared parental leave, flexible working and 
career breaks. These are all updated in line 
with legislation. 

In Band A we have a higher number of 
women at 54.5% compared to 45.5% men. 

However, the roles held by men are more 
senior with higher rates of pay that these 
distinct roles attract. If Band A and Band B 
are combined then we have an average of 
52% of women in mid to senior level roles. 

The table on the page before, Pay Quartiles 
by Gender, illustrates Webhelp’s workforce 
divided into four equal-sized groups based 
on hourly pay rates ranging from Band D 
including the lowest-paid 25% of employees 
(the lower quartile) to Band A covering the 
highest-paid 25% (the upper quartile).  

In order for there to be no gender pay gap, 
there would need to be an equal ratio of men 
to women in each Band. Within Webhelp 
there is a close equal ratio of men to women 
in Bands B, C, D although there is a slight 
imbalance in favour of women in Band A. 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Gender Bonus Gap  

All bonus schemes in Webhelp reward 
individual performance based on objectives. 
The mean gender bonus gap stands at 
52.9% whereas the median gender bonus 
gap is a lot smaller at 23.2%.  

It is important to note the split in gender 
bonus gap between operations, 19.0%, and 
support, 62.8%. The most senior specialist 
roles in our support areas and our executive 
team bonus combined has influenced this 
result significantly. Our bonus payments 
have a direct percentage correlation to base 
pay.   

The proportion of men at Webhelp who 
received a bonus in the 12 months up to 5 
April 2017 was 54.7%, and for women this 
was 49.3%. This reflects the higher 
proportion of men in niche specialist support 
roles which have been benchmarked against 
the market and include a performance 
bonus. 

 

Along with pay and bonus we also reward 
and recognise our people in a variety of fun 
and exciting ways.  

We arrange annual events to celebrate 
length of service and recognition through 
our Star Awards. Our total reward package is 
benchmarked against other global leaders in 
the industry and we look to continuously 
improve on what is offered in innovative 
ways to remain competitive. 

 

 

What are we doing to address the gender pay gap? 

Bonus – bonus scheme rules are 
refreshed annually and eligibility has been 
extended in 2018 to offer more roles 
across the business the opportunity to be 
financially rewarded for great 
performance.  

We recognise that none of these initiatives 
will, in itself, remove the gender pay gap 
and it may be several years before some 
have any impact at all.  

In the meantime, Webhelp is committed 
to reporting on an annual basis on what 
we are doing to reduce the gender pay 
gap and the progress that we are making. 

Any further initiatives launched 
throughout the year will be reported in 
next year’s report. 

We are pleased that Webhelp's gender 
pay gap of 9.1% is well below the average 
mean gender pay gap across the whole of 
the UK economy. We know there is always 
room for improvement and we are 
committed to doing everything that we 
can to continue to narrow the gap.  

We recognise that our ability to influence 
may be limited in some areas, for 
example, we have no direct control over 
the subjects that individuals choose to 
study or the career choices they make 
which can start to influence the gender 
pay gap. However, we are engaged and 
ready to take action in the areas where 
we can influence and make a difference. 

To date, the steps that we have taken to 
promote gender diversity include the 
following: 

Recruitment – training and coaching 
from our people partners and recruitment 
team for all people leaders involved in the 
hiring process to cover gender bias and 
ensure a gender neutral approach. 

Talent – attracting and retaining the most 
valued talent in both operational and 
specialist support roles is key to the 
success of our business. Newly developed 
career progression plans support the 
growth of our people’s potential. A newly 
set up team to focus on Organisational 
Development and Talent Management 
promote gender diversity across the 
business.
