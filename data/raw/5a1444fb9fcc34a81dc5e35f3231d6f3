Gender  Pay  Gap  legislation  (developed  by  the  Government  Equalities  Office)  introduced  in 

April 2017 requires all employers of 250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap 
for  workers  in  scope  as  of  5th  April  2017.  Kirkwood’s  approach  to  pay  supports  the  fair 

treatment and reward of all Employees, irrespective of gender. 

 

On 5th April 2017, 82% of our Employees were female. Whilst this is a very high proportion it 

is  not  unusual  in  the  charity  sector  and  particularly  where  Kirkwood  operates  in  the  care 

sector.

At every level of the organisation, females outnumber males. This is most pronounced in the 

upper middle quartile.

When the median pay gap (below) of 2.9% is considered, this demonstrates that the mean is 

affected by extremes at both ends of the pay scale (i.e. a male with a particularly high hourly 

rate and a female with a particularly low hourly rate).

The median number is important because statistically it reduces the impact of outliers on the 

overall result. 

Overall, Kirkwood’s Median pay gap is calculated at 2.9% or £0.30p per hour 

On  the  26th October  2017,  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  released  provisional  results  for 

the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings. It reported that in April 2017, the UK gender pay 

gap, based on median hourly earnings for full-time employees, decreased to 9.1%. 

 

Overall,  our  results reflect the  overwhelmingly  female workforce.  The gaps that  are  evident 

appear  to  be  indicative  of  a  more  even  split  of  gender  in  the  higher  paid  roles  such  as 

Doctors  and  Management  roles.  For  example,  our  Executive  Management  Team  is  50% 

female and our Operational Management Team is 50% female out of a total of 14 members.

Our  workforce  is  made  up  of  a  significant  number  of  flexible  bank  staff.  These  colleagues 

tend to work in roles that are lower paid and we have more females working in these roles. 

This will naturally lead to a gender pay gap when compared to the whole organisation. 

As  part  of  the  development  of  our  workforce  we  recognise  the  importance  of  promoting 

diversity  in  order  that  we  better  reflect  the  communities  that  we  serve.  Our  recruitment 

methods have become more inclusive but we need to continue to work to attract candidates 

across a wide range of backgrounds in order to achieve this. 

We utilise a robust salary structure and a thorough job evaluation process to ensure fair and 

equitable pay across all roles along with flexible working options and family friendly policies 

designed  to  provide  a  positive  working  environment  to  all.  There  is  however,  always 

improvement to be made. 

Kirkwood  is  therefore  confident  that  the  pay  gap  reported  is  not  due  to  unequal  pay  for 

same or equivalent work but from the types of roles that men and women are recruited into 

and the associated salaries that these attract. 

All reasonable endeavours have been used to ensure that the data submitted in this report is 

accurate.
