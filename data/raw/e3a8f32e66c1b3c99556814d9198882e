From 2017 onwards, any UK organisation employing 250 or more employees has to publicly report on its gender pay gap in six different ways: the mean and median gender pay gaps; the mean and median gender bonus gaps; the proportion of men and women who received bonuses, and the number of men and women according to quartile pay bands.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and women in an organisation.  The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.  The median gender pay gap is the difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.  Gender pay gap reporting does not mean that organisations have to report on equal pay. Equal pay is about differences in the actual earnings of men and women doing equal work. Relyon Ltd is an equal pay employer.  Relyon Ltd is committed to providing equal pay for equal work, not just because this is a legal requirement but because it is the right thing to do. We conduct regular analyses that show male and female employees are paid equally for equivalent work. Our pay policies and practices are designed to control potential biases and to ensure equal pay for equivalent jobs, regardless of gender.  Our gender pay gap data  We collected our data on 5 April 2017 for full paid relevant employees, when our workforce consisted of 119 women and 304 men. The figures show that Relyon Ltd has a mean gender pay gap of 7.9% and a median gender pay gap of minus 6.1% (females were paid higher than males).  In common with many manufacturing Industries, our organisation is predominantly male. Given that 72% of our workforce is male, it is also the case that men outnumber women at senior management levels within the business, including Directors (who are all male).  The results show that 67% of total women (67%) are in the upper middle and upper pay quartiles, and 33% of women in the lower and lower middle quartiles, which compares favourably to the percentage of males.  For men these percentages are 57% in the lower and lower middle quartile and 43% of men in the upper middle and upper pay quartiles.  The higher number of 131 males in the upper middle and upper quartiles, in higher paid senior roles within the business, compared to the 80 females in the same quartiles, has an impact on our gender pay gap.  Results:  Women’s earnings are:  Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay 7.9% lower  Median gender pay gap in hourly pay 6.1% Higher  Difference in mean bonus payments 49.1% lower  Difference in median bonus payments 0% lower  Proportion of men and women receiving a bonus payment:  Men 87.7% were paid a bonus  Women 95.4% were paid a bonus  Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile (%):  Lower quartile: Men 83.0% Women 17.0%  Lower middle: Men 80.2% Women 19.8%  Upper middle: Men 51.0% Women 49.0%  Upper: Men 73.3% Women 26.7%  Action to reduce gender pay gap  We will continue to encourage Women to join our organisation through an inclusive culture and gender neutral practices in our recruitment process.  We will continue to provide training and development opportunities for all employees.  We support flexible working where it is appropriate to do so.
