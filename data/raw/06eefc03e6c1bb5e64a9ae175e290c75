GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017
C.M. Downton (Haulage Contractors) Limited
The  Government  requires  all  businesses  with  more  than  250  employees  to  publish  information 
relating to its pay for men and women. The following report satisfies those legal requirements and is 
in line with guidance provided. All information presented is based on a data snapshot at 5 April 2017 
and is confirmed as being accurate.
Our employee mix of 91.6% male to 8.4% female is consistent with our sector as a whole which 
has historically been male dominated. The vast majority of our operational staff are male, whereas 
female staff are well represented in head office and middle management roles which tend to be 
more highly paid and more likely to attract bonus payments.

The 6 key calculations which we are required to report are set out below:

0.6% HIGHER than males

It is not surprising to me that the above data reflects our clear policy of paying men and women 
equally for equivalent jobs throughout our business. We will continue to encourage female colleagues 
into the industry by embedding female role models into our recruitment process, recognising the 
achievements of female staff and offering flexibility wherever possible.
