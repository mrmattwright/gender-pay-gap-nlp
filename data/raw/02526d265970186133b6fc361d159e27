Our goal is to be one of the best places to work in the UK.  We believe that all employees should be treated fairly, with dignity and respect, and with equal opportunities to progress throughout their careers with DER Touristik UK.  We have always attracted and nurtured female talent, from junior positions through to senior management.  Our first Gender Pay Gap report confirms that we have an excellent gender balance throughout our business. We’re proud that 78% of our overall workforce is female along with half of our senior management.       “As a travel business which has been in the UK market for more than 50 years, our success is built on outstanding customer service, which is bedded into our work ethic.  As such we recruit for attitude and aptitude to attract a diverse selection of applicants and employees to our business, which personify our brand values. We take pride in our efforts to be inclusive, with coaching and career progression plans for everyone regardless of gender and, in producing this report, commit to continuing to improve balance within our organisation.”  Derek Jones, CEO, DER Touristik UK       The gender pay gap at DER Touristik UK    We employ 411 female staff and 117 male staff.  We have a very good gender balance at all levels of the organisation and an overall mean gender pay gap of 27%.  This is predominantly the result of a high percentage of female staff in the lower salary quartiles of the business and we do not consider this to be an equal pay issue. We are confident that our employees, male and female, are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business.  The figures in the report are based on a snapshot date of 5th April 2017.      Mean and Median Gender Pay Gap        Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay       Median gender pay gap in hourly pay       In particular, the gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the salaries and gender make-up of our retail community: 83% of our retail employees are female*. As with many sales roles, our retail employees work to ‘on target earnings’ with additional performance related pay (PRP).      Bonus        Mean bonus gender pay gap       Median bonus pay gap         Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment       Proportion of females receiving a bonus payment       The bonus gap calculation is based on all bonus payments paid between 6 April 2016 and 5 April 2017 including both PRP and the annual bonus.  Retail employees are not eligible for the company’s annual bonus as they receive PRP based on personal sales achieved.

The workshop was led by Kate Hesk, Director at TPC Leadership UK and the sessions were attended by 64 managers/senior execs from HQ and 50 from retail.  Kuoni has partnered with Everywoman, a networking organisation geared towards advancing women in business and sponsored the leadership category in the organisations inaugural travel industry awards.   As a company we also nominated a number of individuals for awards, one of which made the final shortlist.  As well as being involved in the judging process, the awards were promoted internally to signal the company’s commitment to supporting our female talent.  * These figures are based on March 2018.
