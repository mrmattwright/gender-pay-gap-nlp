You can find out more about the Governments Gender Pay Gap requirements here:  https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-equalities-office WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP? This is an equality measure that shows the difference in average earnings between women and men (taking into account applicable pay and bonuses), using a ‘snapshot date’ of 5 April each year, and publishing this data within a year of this date. This is different to equal pay, which is the long standing principle in the UK that women and men are legally entitled to receive equal pay if they are performing equal work. Qioptiq has only one legal entity in England, Scotland or Wales which meets the criteria for mandatory publication set out in the gender pay gap regulations, and accordingly that legal entity, Qioptiq Limited, is required by law to publish an annual gender pay gap report. At Qioptiq Limited we are committed to reducing the gender pay gap. Not only is it the right thing to do, but research shows that a more diverse and inclusive workforce helps business by bringing new skills, creativity and innovation, sounder decision-making and higher employee satisfaction and retention. DATA THAT MUST BE PUBLISHED AND REPORTED Qioptiq Limited must publish and report to the Government and on their own website the following Company details: Mean gender pay gap Median gender pay gap Mean bonus gender pay gap Median bonus gender pay gap Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment Proportion of males and females in each quartile band You can access and read Qioptiq Limited’s Gender Pay Gap Report for 2017 , Click here >>> Return to UK Legislative Compliance and Policies Page >>>                      ENG  DE       Q-Shop: Buy online  Order a LINOS Catalog  Brochures & documents  Product finder  Built to print  Lasers  Micro-optics  Diamond turning  Optical components  Rodenstock Photo Optics  Industrial Manufacturing  Research & Development  Medical & Life Sciences  Defense & Aerospace     Shop online for high-  quality optics, mechanics  and instruments                      Privacy  Terms and Conditions  Compliance  Contact
