Quality and Transparency    Gender Pay Gap Report    UK Office Locations    Ipsos in the world         Investors      Careers        In 2017 the UK Government introduced new legislation requiring all companies in the UK with more than 250 employees to report their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly pay of men and women within a company or workforce. In accordance with this legislation Ipsos MORI has published our report detailing our gender pay gap, and how we intend to close this gap. Ipsos MORI comprises a number of legal entities in the UK, as a result of various acquisition, legacy and legal reasons. Two – Ipsos MORI UK Ltd and Market & Opinion Research International (MORI) Limited – are required to report their gender pay gap under current regulations. We have also chosen to publish the figures for our entire UK business, which contains these two legal entities, as well as others which do not meet the reporting size threshold. The data is correct as of the snapshot reporting date of 5 April 2017.
