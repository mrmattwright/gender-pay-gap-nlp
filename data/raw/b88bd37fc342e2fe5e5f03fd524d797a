2017 Gender Pay Report 

 

 

1 

In 2018, for the first time UK companies with over 250 employees are required to report on 
their gender pay gap. 

The gender pay gap has been defined as the diﬀerence between the average hourly earnings 
of all male and female employees in the workforce.  Gender pay reporting is distinct from 
equal pay, which is more specific and, rightly, aimed at ensuring that men and women are 
paid the same for carrying out work of equal value. We are confident that TSG employees 
with the same experience, capability and performance are paid equally for doing the same 
jobs.  Additionally, we recruit and promote people based upon those criteria, irrespective of 
their gender.   

Like all businesses, our gender pay gap is driven by the structure of our workforce.  There are 
certain roles and departments within the company which tend to attract employees of one 
gender.  The distribution of gender throughout TSG tends to mirror our industry sector as a 
whole - indeed women make up just 25% of our reportable workforce.  Historically, but things 
are  changing,  men  are  more  likely  than  women  to  be  employed  in  more  senior  roles.   In 
addition,  men  are  more  likely  to  be  employed  in  technical  and  sales  roles,  which  tend  to 
attract higher rates of pay and bonus potential. 

When you drill into the detail at TSG of the 127 roles contained within the reportable data, 
21 have a split of both male and female employees.  Of these 21 roles, over half show a gender 
pay gap within those roles in favour of women.  Generally, the differences are within 15% 
either way and in the couple of instances where a larger gap exists, there are understandable 
reasons which have now been addressed. 

As  a  final  word,  at  TSG  we  are  committed  to  fair  recruitment  and  reward  processes.  We 
continue to regularly review our policies, practices, training and development to ensure we 
are supporting all employees as best we can in both their personal and professional lives.  We 
do not and will not treat our employees differently because of their gender.  

The data below shows: 

•  Our mean and median gender pay gap (based on hourly rates of pay at a snapshot 
date  of  5  April  2017)  and  bonus  pay  gap  (based  on  bonuses  paid  over  a  12-month 
period ending 5 April 2017). 

•  The proportion receiving bonus pay (based on bonuses paid over a 12-month period 

ending 5 April 2017). 

•  The gender distribution across 4 equally divided pay quartiles.
