Our voluntary completion of the Gender Pay Gap reporting process stands as testimony to this commitment and has allowed us to understand our organization more completely.  We will now objectively examine our policies and seek year-on-year improvement.  Our mean average gender pay gap (females lower than males) is 10.7% and the median average is 21.2%.  At this stage it seems clear that our pay gap is heavily influenced by a higher proportion of female staff occupying more junior and lower skill level roles.  There are also important insights in the proportion of males and females in each of the mean hourly rate quartile pay bands.  The quartile bands were achieved by ranking the male and female hourly rates from the lowest to the highest. We then divided the list into four sections with an equal number of employees in each section. If there were a number of employees on the same hourly rate of pay crossing two quartiles, we ensured the split between male and female was as even as possible. We then applied the relevant calculations to each quartile to show the proportion of male and female employees.  The proportional representation in each quartile at the census date of April 2017 is as shown below:  Pay Proportion by Quartile      Lower    Lower Middle    Upper Middle    Top      M    F    M    F    M    F    M    F        32.8%      67.2%      60.3%      39.7%      47.4%      52.6%      67.2%      32.8%        Reducing the Gap  Corpus Christi College has in place a number of measures that collectively should address the issues of balance.  These include the appointment of an Equality Fellow who is engaged in a series of consultation conversations with students and fellows about how to improve gender equality. Initial actions include Diversity and Unconscious Bias training for staff involved with recruitment and a close attention to the composition of appointment and remuneration panels so that they embody a gender balanced structure.  In addition, many of our academic staff hold joint appointments with departments that engage with the Athena SWAN initiative (not currently available to Corpus as an institution). Corpus mirrors their equality and diversity focused actions in joint position recruitment which, along with our internal actions, indicates our commitment to tackling gender inequality within higher education generally.
