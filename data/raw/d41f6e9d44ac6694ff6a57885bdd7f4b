We collect and monitor our workforce data, and conduct periodic surveys and focus groups to seek the views of our staff.  Local communities  We produce detailed community profiles about the people and places of Kent and Medway at a county and local level which include statistical data on characteristics such as gender, age, race, religion, and disability.  We get to know our communities through initiatives such as open days at our fire stations , safety education programmes for young people, attendance at community events and visits to individual households to offer safety advice.  We formally consult with the public, partners and staff, including representatives of diversity groups, on all of our major decisions through our Safety and Wellbeing Plan consultation process.  Service users  We use incident data, debriefs and surveys to identify who uses our services, which groups of people are most or least likely to use them in the future and to get feedback about how satisfied they are with the service they receive. All of this information is published as part of the Corporate Plan .  Staff  Regulations included in the Equalities Act 2010 requires KFRS to publish a report specific to our gender pay gap. Gender Gap shows the differences in percentages in average pay between men and women within our organisation across all types of work/staff groups. (It is not the same as Equal Pay which is the difference between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs or work of equal value). If you would like to read our report please click this link   In addition to monitoring the composition of our workforce through analysis of data (age, gender etc), we seek the views of our staff through regular meetings, staff surveys, focus groups and diversity support groups.    Partnerships  We have a number of partnerships with other local authorities, agencies and community groups. Working with these partners helps us to engage with communities and meet their diverse needs.  Analysing and understanding data  We have a team of analysts which use the data gathered in order to profile community risks and ensure that we continue to provide the services that people need. This analysis identifies emerging trends so that we can continue to develop our services for the future.
