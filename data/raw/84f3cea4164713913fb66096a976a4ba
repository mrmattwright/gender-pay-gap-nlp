Gripple Ltd: Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

 

STATEMENT 

We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 

The gender pay gap gives a snapshot of the gender balance within an organisation. It measures the 
difference between the average earnings of all male and female employees, regardless of their role or 
seniority. It is distinct from equal pay, which is about ensuring that men and women are paid the 
same for carrying out work of equal value.  

We can use these results to assess: 

the levels of gender equality in our workplace 
the balance of male and female employees at different levels 

 
 
  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded 
 
Gripple Ltd has calculated the required figures and at the snapshot date of 1st April 2017, our gender 
pay gap data was as follows. 
 
PAY GAP  

We have a mean gender pay gap (the difference between the average hourly pay of men and 
women, expressed as a percentage) of 20.4% and a median (the difference between the median 
hourly pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage) gender pay gap of 5.1%.  
 
Whilst our median gap is smaller than the current national average of 18.4%, our mean gap is slightly 
larger than the current national mean average of 17.4%, which shows we have some work to do.

MAIN CAUSES FOR THE GENDER PAY GAP AT GRIPPLE 

 

 

Our gender pay gap is due to a lack of female representation in senior roles, including engineering, 
sales and leadership. We have three times more men than women in our senior roles, for example.  
 
TAKING ACTION TO CLOSE THE GAP 
 
We recognise that our gender pay gap is above average and we wish to address this. Some of our 
initial actions include the following: 

  attract and nurture the widest possible female talent pool through inclusive recruitment practices  
  enable more women to progress to senior management levels through mentoring and internal 
development, maximising use of the recently acquired Gripple Training Academy, to ensure a 
pipeline of suitably experienced and capable candidates is available for consideration for 
promotion into senior roles 

  continue to work with educational bodies to attract more girls and women into STEM subjects 
 
review our maternity/paternity policy and flexible working options to enable our employees to 
effectively manage their work/life balance and support women returning from maternity leave 
back into the workplace 

 
I confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
