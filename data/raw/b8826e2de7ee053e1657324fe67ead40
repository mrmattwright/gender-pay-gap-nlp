Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay which deals with pay difference between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in the workforce. If the pay gap is higher, it can indicate that there may be issues to deal with, and the various calculations may help to identify what those issues are. Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust is committed to promoting equality and inclusion. Our current gender split within the overall workforce is 80% female and 20% male. We promote a range of options to support flexible working solutions for all our staff. The NHS terms and conditions of service handbook, contains the national agreements on pay and conditions of service for NHS staff, other than very senior managers and medical staff.   Job evaluation enables posts to be matched to national job profiles; or allows trusts to evaluate jobs locally, and determine in which Agenda for Change pay band a post should sit. The only pay elements we have that fall under the bonus pay criteria are clinical excellence awards that are only applicable to medical consultants in accordance with the Medical and Dental Consultant contract. The Clinical Excellence Awards recognise and reward those consultants who contribute most towards the delivery of safe and high quality care to patients; and to the continuous improvement of the NHS.  There is a rigorous application and decision process to determine the award, if any, for any consultant applicant.

Over the last year, we have seen a positive direction of travel with regards to representation of women in senior roles within Oxleas. We are conscious that there will be a range of factors that influence the results. We believe that the opportunity to work flexibly is likely to be one of the key factors that influence the progression of women within the workforce. To this end, we launched a trust-wide flexible working survey in late February to support our engagement and retention programme. We will be reviewing the results of the survey in light of the gender pay gap report as well.  We are particularly conscious of the disparity in relation to “bonus” payments and will be working with the medical workforce to understand this better.   The medical consultant body (who would be eligible to apply for clinical excellence awards that would be categorised as “bonus”) in Oxleas represents less than 3% of the workforce and we are aware that these small numbers can result in the pay differential appearing more stark.  In addition, over 30% of our female consultant workforce works part-time hours thus depressing overall earnings further.  We are encouraged by the fact that nearly half the eligible female consultants received a clinical excellence award last year.   We are very aware that we need to look closer at these results and agree actions that support a better balance in earnings and awards.  A small working party with representation from the members of our Equality and Human Rights Governance Group will be carrying out further investigation into the data to identify the factors that may explain the higher proportion of female staff working part time.  This group will also aim to assure the organisation about the systems, policies and procedures currently in place, and whether these are providing effective and appropriate support to our staff.  This will ensure those staff members with considerable experience and expertise continue to contribute effectively to the work of the trust.
