Pay & bonus gap  Difference between Men & Women       Mean  Median    Hourly Fixed Pay  18.5%  18.6%    Bonus Paid  41.89%  28.3%    The table above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017). It also captures the mean and median difference between bonuses paid to men and women in the year up to 5 April 2017, i.e. for the 2016 performance year.  The hourly fixed pay is broadly in line with organisations in the same sector and industry.  Background and industry specific data  We know that our industry sector has predominantly appealed to a much higher number of males than females and so we are working with schools and universities to raise awareness of what a career in Engineering could be like.  The latest statistics show that at GCSE stage the balance of males to females opting for STEM subjects is fairly equal, but this drops significantly throughout A levels and then resulting in only 25% of core STEM subject graduates being female. Our company gender split reflects this, as only 22% of our staff are female.    What ASM is doing to tackle the gender pay gap  Whilst the industry data suggests that ASM’s gender pay gap is broadly in line with similar organisations throughout the UK, we are active in working to close the gap.   We have already introduced some policies and working practises that will benefit women more specifically, and we have plans to move forward on a number of initiatives.  Greater flexibility: ASM has introduced a flexitime policy, increasing the level of flexibility of when and where hours are worked.  Influencing women’s career choice: ASM’s industry sector has historically attracted a greater number of male recruits to roles that predominantly require STEM skills.  Due to high levels of retention, there is little staff turnover.  ASM has been working to build links with local schools, colleges and universities to influence career choice for women in order to increase the number of women leaving education with STEM-related qualifications that suit our business needs.  Introducing enhanced maternity pay: ASM has conducted a benefits review and is introducing enhanced maternity pay, going above and beyond typical maternity pay in the sector and geographic location.  At ASM, we understand the challenges in eliminating the Gender Pay Gap in our industry, and we are fully on board with taking actions to do this.  Our aims are to continue to encourage, develop and retain a greater number of women and so have set an ambitious target of reducing the gap by 5% by 2020.  (i.e. to below 14%)  Download Full Report           © ASM Assembly Systems GmbH & Co.KG 2016 | Privacy Policy | Terms of Use         Highlights & Specials  SIPLACE Smart Pin Support  SIPLACE Glue Feeder  SIPLACE Placement Heads  SIPLACE Vision System  ASM Technologies  ASM Workflows  DEK Under Stencil Cleaning  DEK Paste Management  DEK Clamping & Tooling  DEK Transport Systems  DEK Stencils & Screens   Products  SIPLACE TX  SIPLACE SX-Series  SIPLACE X-Series  SIPLACE CA  SIPLACE Pre-Owned Equipment  ASM Line Software  ASM Service & Support  DEK NeoHorizon  DEK Galaxy  DEK Process Support Products   Company & News  Start at ASM  Available Jobs  ASM News & Events  ASM Press  ASM Newsletter  Smart #1 SMT Factory  ASM Company  ASM Management  SMT Center of Competence  ASM Pacific Technology Support  ASM Hotline  ASM Contact & Expert Search  ASM Licence Manager  ASM Training Acadamy  ASM Toolkit (DMS)  ASM Forum  ASM Picture Database  SIPLACE Spare Parts Catalogue
