The impressive growth includes a new partnership deal with Daventry District Council, due commence trading on 4th June 2018, worth around £60milllion over the 10-year life of the agreement. The company has also seen significant business wins across its operating divisions and subsidiaries around the UK. Sales Director Geoff Tucker says that to date new contracts for 2017/18 represent an annual turnover value of over £17million, which will top £18million by the time its current financial year finishes at the end of March. Tucker also says that the projected total annual figure for new business equates to a forward order book value of around £100million, taking the company’s total forward orders to more than £2billion of sustainable business. “Our operating divisions, which are mainly based in Norfolk and Suffolk, have had the best year in the company’s history in terms of winning contracts,” he said.  “Our current partnerships with local authorities around the country have also generated significant new business, providing additional vital revenue for council partners to the benefit of the local communities.” The company puts the growth down to consistently winning large commercial contracts, and to proven results leading to councils adding additional services to the local authority partnerships’ portfolios. “Our catering division in particular has seen impressive gains, recently winning eight major education catering contracts in Norfolk and Suffolk, with an average forward order value of £175k,” Geoff Tucker said. “But the cleaning, security, grounds, building maintenance and facilities management divisions have all added substantial revenue. The Local Authority Partnerships are taking on an increasing amount of work from their council partners, in addition to winning significant new private sector business in their areas.” The growth has also created an increase in sales staff, with new Business Development Managers being appointed for a number of the local authority partnerships. Norse, which provides over 10,000 nationally, is set to see turnover exceed £300million for the year ending 31 March 2018.
