The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference  between men’s and women’s earnings across an organisation and the report  provides context and data on this across a number of measures. It also sets out  a summary of the positive work being done across the University to address pay  equality.  This is the first year of the new Government regulations which makes  it mandatory for all organisations with more than 250 employees to report their  gender pay gap on an annual basis.
