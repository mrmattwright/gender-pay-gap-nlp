            This is RSK       Search                                         Our responsibility to people                    As Investors in People, we are committed to ensuring the efficient and effective management and development of our staff. We operate an open and relaxed management culture that nurtures continuous improvement and innovation .  As an entrepreneurial organisation, RSK aims to accelerate its employee’s professional development while creating a diverse and inclusive work environment. The company is therefore committed to providing relevant training and support to all employees.  Further, retaining staff is the building block of a successful organisation. As a company RSK strives to ensure its staff maintain a healthy work–life balance with many opportunities for flexible working hours, flexibility of locality, social activities and community involvement projects.  Diversity  RSK strives to treat all employees, whether part-time, full-time or temporary, fairly and with respect. It fully supports the principle of equality in employment and opposes all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination in relation to a protected characteristic such as age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marriage and civil partnership, or pregnancy and maternity.  Our percentage of female engineers is above the UK industry average.  Gender pay gap reporting  Each company within the RSK Group with more than 250 employees needs to report its gender pay gap on its company and a government website each year. For us, that means RSK Environment Ltd and RSK ADAS Ltd, and the 2017 results and analysis can be seen here .  The headline figures are 12.2% and 20.8% (mean) gender pay gaps for RSK Environment Ltd and RSK ADAS Ltd respectively. (The Office for National Statistics 2017 gives a mean of 17.4% for all UK employees.*) Our split by pay quartile shows that our gender pay gap is because we have a higher proportion of men in better paid roles. Increasing the number of women in senior roles is something we are working hard to achieve.  * www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/ datasets/annualsurveyofhoursandearningsashegenderpaygaptables  What is the gender pay gap?  The gender pay gap is simply the difference in hourly pay between all men and all women, regardless of their roles. It is not the same as equal pay, which deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value .   The gender pay gap is thus often a measure of how well women are represented in senior roles.  Ethics  RSK is committed to conducting its business according to ethical, professional and legal standards in an honest and transparent manner. Our board of directors continues to develop the group’s anti-bribery and anti-corruption procedures to ensure that there is effective implementation of them, thereby establishing a culture in which bribery and corruption are not acceptable.   Every year, managing directors conduct assessments of their business to ensure that procedures are in place to prevent and detect bribery and corruption.  For the avoidance of doubt, RSK policy outlines the levels of corporate hospitality received and offered that are considered commensurate with genuine business networking and improving customer relationships and procedures for authorisation.   RSK is committed to ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place within its own business and in its supply chains.
