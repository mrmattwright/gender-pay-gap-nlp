MORE      Gender Pay Gap Reporting  Gender pay gap is used to determine whether on average a business pays more to men than women and should not be confused with pay equality which focuses on rates of pay for comparable jobs. The gender pay gap has been calculated using the snapshot date of 5th April 2017 and has been calculated within the guidelines of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. Our median (or midpoint) gender pay gap is 3% and our mean gap (the difference between the average earnings of males and females) is 25%. The mean pay gap does not fairly take into account the extreme differences that the mid point range shows. For example by removing the Board Members and Shareholders, who are currently all male employees, the mean gap would be re stated as 3% showing a much closer link with the median, for employees. The bonus gender pay gap is calculated using relevant data for the year ended at the snapshot date and includes both commission and bonuses. Our mean bonus gap is 30% and our median bonus gap is 56%. Female employees receiving bonus payments was 59% compared to 74% of male employees. These differences will be due, in part, to the cash value of bonuses being awarded to women being lower than those awarded to men because of the distribution of part time work. The remainder will be due to the performance at a variety of sites wherby people have not met the criteria for a bonus to be paid. Our reward system aims to recognise the work that our employees put in, and performance over and above our budgeted standards are recognised through our company-wide bonus scheme, which incorporates all spa and leisure employees regardless of gender.  At the snapshot date, 64% of employees within the upper pay quartile were female compared to 34% of men in the same quartile, with 66% and 70% of employees in the upper middle and lower middle pay quartiles being female, compared to 34% and 30% of men for the same quartiles. The lower pay quartile has 75% of females and 25% of men employed.  We continue to take actions to ensure all employees are fairly treated, and currently the exec management team are working on new ways of interacting with employees, from recruitment, through training and retention, to assist the continuous development of all employees.
