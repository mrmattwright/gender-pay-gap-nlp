Gender Pay Report 2018  We welcome the opportunity to carry out Gender Pay Reporting and to provide analysis on the results. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between men and women in a workforce. Our report outlines the gender pay gap using a snapshot date of 5th April 2017. This information will be the basis of ongoing reviews and analysis in order to increase the diversity of the organisation and to continue to provide a quality service in line with the Autism Plus philosophy. The report details that 68% of the total workforce are female, 75% of the Senior Management Team are female and the Board comprises of a 50/50 split of males and females.  Our approach to pay is based on the job role, and therefore men and women that do equivalent jobs are paid at an equal level. Download the Autism Plus Gender Pay Report 2018 .
