Gender Pay and Equal Pay  Gender Pay is different to ‘equal pay’. Equal pay is the difference in pay between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs.  We have no reason to believe that we have any equal pay concerns, meaning that we believe that all our staff are paid fairly for the work which they do.      This statement is made pursuant to the Gender Pay Gap Reporting requirements under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  As part of the regulations Rowan Drilling UK, Ltd. has carried out analysis of its workforce as at 5 April 17 and during the relevant qualifying period to calculate and determine a number of results as required by the regulations.  The results are as shown below:     Gender Pay Gap Analysis

  proportion of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower, lower
  middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands       The Company is essentially an engineering group and notes that, as a broad industry classification, there tends to be greater representation of males within the industry.  This is exacerbated at the Company as significantly fewer females are employed offshore.  Only 1.3% of its offshore employees are female compared with 30% onshore.  The Company will continue to make efforts to make such roles available to suitably qualified candidates regardless of their gender (or other background).  When offshore staff are considered in isolation, 100% of both male and female staff received a bonus and the hourly pay gaps reduced to single percentage figures (9.53% at mean and 2.42% at median).  I confirm that the information in this statement as required by the Gender Pay Gap Reporting requirements is accurate.
