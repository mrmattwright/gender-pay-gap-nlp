North West Community Services (Greater Manchester) Ltd & North West 

Community Services (Merseyside Ltd) Gender Pay Report 2017 

 
NWCS have an obligation to report on gender pay differences for companies with over 250 
staff. Although the Group’s Merseyside company has less than the required 250 employees 
required for reporting purposes the two operational support services under Merseyside and 
Manchester account for almost 95% of all employees and therefore the board has elected to 
self-report on this company as well as the Manchester company. 
 
NWCS have a robust Equality Policy which is actively enforced however due to the nature of 
the service provided by NWCS, almost 2/3 of the company’s employees are female with many 
working in the front line as support workers. By comparison the NHS gender workforce split 
is 77% female and 23% male. 
 
Following the acquisition of NWCS by Mediline Nurses & Carers Ltd in 2016 the 3 main board 
company directors of both the Merseyside and Manchester companies are male. The ultimate 
holding company – Peter Cook Ltd has 1 male and 1 female board director. By comparison 
the 3 directors of services within the Merseyside and Manchester companies are all female. 
 
In summary, the percentage proportion of males to females within each quartile banding is 
indicative  of  the  synergy  that  NWCS  has  achieved  across  the  organisation  though  the 
application of the companies Equality Policy and as can be seen in the figures are comparable 
across the two services. 
 
For transparency no males in Merseyside received a bonus hence the 100% variance.
