 

Gender Pay Gap Report 

 
Introduction 

 

As of April 2017, UK legislation requires 
businesses with 250 or more employees 
to publish their gender pay gap results, 
covering pay and bonuses.  At Griffiths we 
are fully committed to supporting the 
principles of the gender pay gap initiative.  
We are also committed to the principles 
of equal pay for all our employees.   

As with many organisations in our sector 
we are aware that females are typically 

under-represented.  We are actively 
challenging this trend to attract more 
females into our business. We are 
confident that we do not operate any form 
of discrimination within our reward 
structures or recruitment processes. We 
are, however, committed to continuing to 
work to reduce the existing gender pay gap 
and are in the process of identifying further 
actions that may have a positive impact on 
this.

The hourly gender pay gap measures the 
difference between men and women’s 
average earnings for normal working 
hours. Our mean gender pay gap for 
average hourly pay as at April 2017 was 
19.6%, with our median being 5.2%.  

When using the mean to calculate an 
average, it is influenced by the salaries of 
senior employees within an organisation 
and thus may not be truly representative 
of the average earnings of a typical 
employee. In taking the median, the 
middle value of the data is considered, 
and consequently it is considered a better 
indicator of typical average earnings. 

As is customary in our industry we have a 
high population of males. This is 
particularly apparent in our site based 
manual operations, which is the area of 

 
 
 
 

our business where the majority of our 
staff are employed. In light of this, we are 
encouraged that our gender pay gap is 
close to the national average of 18.1%. 

The national average gender pay gap for 
our sector is a mean of 17.3% and a median 
of 16.7%. We are therefore further 
encouraged by our median, which is far 
lower than the sector average and which 
illustrates our strong commitment to 
paying men and women in comparable 
roles equally.  

Our mean figure illustrates the fact that 
most senior roles within the organisation 
are currently held by men. We are 
committed to reducing this figure by 
continuing to mentor, promote and recruit 
more females into senior positions.

The quartile bands reflect the fact that 
the proportion of males within the 
business is higher than females which is 
an accurate reflection of our workforce.   

The Lower to Upper Middle bands 
identify that the number of females 
throughout these bands are 
proportionately balanced. The Upper 
quartile demonstrates that we are under-
represented by females at  

senior level positions in the business.  
We have been successful in attracting 
graduates and trainees into the 
organisation, and therefore expect to see 
more females progressing through our 
career structure to make up a higher 
proportion of our Upper pay quartile in the 
future, as indicated by the progression 
within the Upper Middle quartile presently. 
 

Encouraging and Supporting Diversity and Next Steps 
 

In order to encourage more females into our 
industry, we provide role models to speak to 
young, female students during construction 
fairs and school visits. We have held 
‘Women in Construction Events’ and 
participate in the Central Government’s ‘Not 
Just for Boys’ campaign. We will be 
continuing with these initiatives.  

We are also committed to supporting the 
‘Inspire Me’ campaign to explore new ways 
 
 
 
 

of attracting and encouraging females to 
join what has traditionally been seen as a 
predominately male industry.  

We will continue to assess our gender pay 
gap balance with our current employees 
and externally through our recruitment 
practices, careers fairs and our 
apprentice/graduate recruitment schemes.
