In line with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 , this page sets the pay rates for women and men.  We are very pleased that the data confirms that our staff are paid according to the nature and complexity of their work and not their gender.  The differences are shown in relation to hourly rates of pay and are as follows (at 5 April 2017):   our mean pay gap is 0.29% - this means that on average, the women who work for the charity are paid very slightly less per hour than men - 99.7p for every £1.00 that men earn (the Government guidance says that this means the hourly rates are the same, as it's less than 0.5p difference)  our median pay gap is -0.6% - this means that, taking the middle point between the lowest and highest rates of pay, women are paid slightly more per hour than men - £1.01 for every £1 that men earn.   The pay gap regulations also require us to show the percentage of women and men employed in different pay ​quartiles ​ - this means that our total pay scale, from the highest to the lowest, has been divided into four, and we have reported on the percentage of women and men in each:     These results reflect the fact that, as with most education and care providers in the charity sector, we employ more women than men at every pay level across the charity.  We are also required to report on rates of bonus pay, but the charity does not pay bonuses to staff.  We're committed to maintaining these results, which are a positive demonstration that men and women are paid equally across the charity.  All figures above are accurate and have been signed off by our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Lever.
