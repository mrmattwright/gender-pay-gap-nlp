For the first time, all large UK companies employing 250+ 

people are required to report on their gender pay. 

 

The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay 

ensures that men and women receive the same pay for the 

same or equivalent work.  

 

The gender pay gap measure is a simple average figure for 

all employees, irrespective of the job that they do.

FOREWORD 

At Karro, our most important asset are 
our people. Their passion, commitment 
and integrity are critical to our past and 
future business success.  

We believe that we benefit the most when 
we can offer:-  

Gender Pay Gap Report 

 

 

 

Our pay gap at Karro exists because:- 

  We employ more men than women 
  There  are  more  men 

in  skilled 

operational roles (e.g. butchery) 

  There  are  more  men  in  managerial 

roles 

 

that 

We  believe 
the  most  successful 
teams  are  formed  from  a    diverse  talent 
pool.  We  will  continue  to  create  a  culture 
where  everyone  can  succeed  regardless 
of  background  or  gender.  We  will  look  to 
attract,  recruit  and  provide  progressive 
career  opportunities  to  build  a  successful 
and diverse Karro team.  

 

I am proud to lead an organisation that 
is  a  market  leader  because  of  the  fair 
and ethical way in which we operate.  

  Equal opportunity for all, regardless of 

background or gender 

  An  open,  engaging  and 

inclusive 
culture  –  where  everyone  can  play  a 
part in our success 

  A fair reward for great performance

As  you  will  see  on  the  following  pages  of 
our report, our median gender pay gap at 
9%  is  half  that  of  the  UK  statistics,  as 
reported  by 
for  National 
Statistics  (ONS)  of  18.4%1  (which  is  the 
gap  of  all  employees  (part  and  full-time 
working  patterns)  across  all 
reported 
sectors in the UK).

Karro’s median gender pay gap is 9%  and 
mean 
16% 
(representing all relevant part time and full 
time  employees  at  Karro).  Compared 
against  the  aforementioned  reported  pay 
gap  for  all  employees  at  18.4%1  (ONS 
2017),  representing  all  part  and  full  time 
relevant  employees  in  the  UK,  this  shows 
our  pay  gap  as  being  on  average  50% 
lower  than  the  reporting  UK  companies 
employing over 250 people.  

We employ colleagues across a multitude 
of  functions  within  an  industry  which  has 
traditionally  attracted    more  males  than 
females, particularly within skilled butchery 
and  leadership  positions.  To  close  our 
gender  pay  gap  further  still,  we  will  listen 
to  the  views  of  our  employees  and  the 
wider  community  as  to  why  fewer  women 
than  men  choose  a  career  with  us  and 
following  this  will  focus on  how  we  recruit 
and  how  we  support  the  development  of 
our people.

The bonus payments at the median value 
(the  mid-point  of  all  the  bonuses  paid) 
show  females  being  paid  at  a  35%  lower 
bonus  value  than  males;  again  attributed 
to  a  lower  female  population  in  more 
skilled  or  managerial  roles  and  it  is  in 
these  roles  where 
the  higher  bonus 
payments occur.

The mean average amount paid to women 
is 51% higher than for males which is due 
to 
the  number  of  highly  performing 
females  in  the  business  and  the  bonus 
scheme  fairly  recognising  and  rewarding 
this performance. 

 

What  do  all  of  these 
results tell us? 

The  pattern  of  many  lower  skilled  roles 
being occupied by women within the UK is 
reflected 
the  make-up  of  Karro’s 
workforce, where skilled and management 
roles are predominantly occupied by men.

Our  focus  remains,  therefore,  on  how  to 
bring  more  women

managerial  positions

identified  that  our  relatively  low  labour 
turnover  in  senior  roles  may  contribute  to 
this.  At  Karro,  27%  of  our  colleagues 
have  been  with  us  for  longer  than  10 
years.    This  is  an  indicator  that  job 
satisfaction and stability of employment at 
Karro  is  positive,  yet  it  brings  its  own 
challenges;  resulting  in  less  opportunities 
to progress into leadership roles, a limiting 
factor  for  females  to  find  a  way  into 
management roles.  

What are we doing to close 
the gap? 

 

 

 

Our Recruitment Strategy 

We  work  closely  with  a  number  of 
recruitment  partners    to  source  the  very 
best  skills  and  talent.    In  doing  this  our 
recruiters  are  tasked  with  an  equality 
agenda,  ensuring  that  we  advertise  our 
roles  openly,  allowing  equal  access  to 
application  regardless  of  gender,  race, 
religion  or  culture.  As  part  of  this  process 
we  are  actively  involved  in  recruitment 
partnership  programmes 
support 
individuals returning to work, including the 
long term unemployed.

For 2018 and 2019 we have plans to work 
closely with schools and colleges, tapping 
into  new  talent  pools  where  females  and 
males  exist 
in  equal  numbers,  and 
therefore  reducing  our  reliance  on  those 
who  have  pre-existing  experience  in  the 
meat industry, where the predominance of 
candidates  are  male.    We  will  utilise  the 
knowledge  of  those  within  education  to 
support  us  in  finding  ways  to  encourage 
more  women  to  work  in  our  industry, 
breaking down barriers to entry for women 
and  dispel  misconceptions  about  our 
industry.
