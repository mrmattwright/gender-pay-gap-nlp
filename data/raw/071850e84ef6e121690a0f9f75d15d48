The first intake of 50 boys were welcomed by Principal Eynon Davies, and taught by only one other member of staff, Edward Loveluck.      1945    The Senior Technical School was founded as the Junior Technical School is upgraded.      1949    Bridgend Technical College was created as further education on a full and part-time basis was consolidated. For the next ten years, the School and the College were run alongside each other.      1959    The Technical School and nearby Bridgend Boys’ Grammar School merged and together with several members of staff moved to Ewenny Road – to what is now Brynteg Comprehensive.      1975    Bridgend College of Technology was formed.      2007    Bridgend College was born and a new corporate identity sees the introduction of ‘campuses’ with reference to the four college sites (Bridgend, Pencoed, Maesteg and Porthcawl) and the Business Centre at Queens Road.    The Corporation The Board consists of a total of twenty Governors, chaired by Mr Paul Croke who was appointed as Chair of the Governing Body in October 2014. The Board meets at least six times during the year and work is also carried out at the various committees, namely the Audit Committee, Curriculum and Quality Committee, Finance and Estates Committee and Human Resources Committee. There are also Search and Selection Committees which meet when required and focus on the appointments of Governors and Senior Post holders respectively. Finally, the Remuneration Committee usually meets once per year which concentrates on the objectives, pay and conditions of Senior Post holders and the Clerk. The main role of the Governing Body is to determine the “educational character and mission of the institution and oversight of its activities”, which involves Governors focusing on the College’s broad purpose and strategic direction, nature of educational programme, pattern of courses, any special characteristics of range of subjects taught, overall ethos, admissions policy and relationship to community. One extremely important aspect of governance involves the effective and efficient use of resources, solvency of the institution and safeguarding of assets. This involves the approval of annual estimates of income and expenditure.
