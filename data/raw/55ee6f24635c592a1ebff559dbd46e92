To put this into motoring perspective, Henry Ford did not build his first Model T until 1908.  Whilst we draw on traditional values, we are young at heart. The key to our longevity is genuine customer satisfaction. We have won the Ford Chairman's Award for customer satisfaction 17 times, we have been recognised as being one of the top three Citroën dealers in the UK for customer satisfaction, we have received the Kia Platinum Award for being one of the top thirty dealers in the world and we are the only dealer to have won Motability’s annual Regional Dealer of the Year Award twice.  In turn, we believe the key to customer satisfaction is employee satisfaction. We believe in mutual respect and equal opportunities and make sure our staff get the support they need together with regular training and the latest tools and equipment. As valued members of the team, our staff are willing to go that extra mile to make sure they meet our customers' needs and expectations.  We trust you will find us approachable, knowledgeable and professional in everything that we do. If you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.
