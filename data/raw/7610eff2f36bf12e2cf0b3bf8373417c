GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

2017

INTRODUCTION

Denise Brown
Principal & Chief Executive

Our city is rich in diversity.  Our College
aims to reflect the people and
communities we serve, not just because it
is the right thing to do, but because
gender balance and diversity are critical to
us in delivering outstanding teaching and
learning for our communities, and
stakeholders.    

Stoke on Trent College is committed to
building a diverse and inclusive workplace
for our current and future team, that
provides and promotes equality of
opportunity to all employees irrespective
of gender.  We all strive to support our
learners to reach their full potential, an
approach that we embrace for our
employees too.  Our aim to ensure that,
through effective policies, initiatives and
supportive mechanisms for employees,
reflection and scrutiny of our practices,
behaviours and workforce profile, we
continually move forward in addressing
workplace barriers to equality.  

Whilst I am clear that what we pay at the
College is not driven by gender, we are
fully aware of and committed to the
journey faced by us and many UK
employers to close the pay gap.
This will form an essential element of our
college Strategy.
About the College
Stoke on Trent College is a General
Further Education institute which supports
over 17,000 enrolments each year to meet
the demands of local and sub regional
employers and stakeholders in the
community we serve.  Programmes are
focussed on developing occupational,
technical and professional skills.

The curriculum offer flexes to respond to
the needs and priorities of our key
partners and stakeholders, which over
time has resulted in specialisms being
developed, especially in Science,
Technology, Engineering and
Manufacturing (STEM); Health and Social
Care and Mathematics and English Skills.

What is a gender pay gap?  
Gender pay differs from equal pay –
people frequently confuse the two but
they are not the same.  Gender pay shows
the differences in the average pay
between men and women – a measure of
labour market or workplace disadvantage.
Equal pay means that there should be no
contractual differences between men and

women who carry out the same or similar
jobs or work of equal value.  This
document sets out the College gender
pay gap and the ways in which we plan to
effectively address this currently, whilst
acknowledging that this is a long term
focus for us. Therefore, we will continually
monitor our direction and speed of travel
in reducing any gap.

UNDERSTANDING THE GAP

As the summary figures show, a gender
pay gap exists here at the College.
However, it is important to understand the
wider context of the College workforce
profile, particularly in relation to the nature
of our business, and the range of skills and
specialisms we draw from the wide range
of industry sectors.

The College has a largely female
workforce with almost two thirds of our
workforce being female.  We categorise
our roles into Support, Academic,
Management and Assessor roles.  Support
roles, which equate to 48% of the
workforce, are in the majority (72%)
occupied by female workers. The nature of
the education sector, particularly for
support services is to have term time
working arrangements in place.  This part
time working is a factor in attracting
predominantly females to these roles,
reflective of society norms and childcare
responsibilities.  In the scope of the
College’s pay structure, support roles are
generally paid across the lower pay bands,

in comparison to management and
academic roles, or those requiring
specialist knowledge and expertise, for
instance from STEM industries.

Our STEM related provision echoes the
industry sector in that there is a
significantly lower proportion of females to
males.  This has impacted on our
recruitment in these areas where our
teams are dominated by males.  There is
no quick fix to this issue, but as a
qualification provider and employer we are
committed to supporting the required
change.  What we have also experienced
in the Further Education Sector, and here
at the College, is that in order to attract
and secure good quality, highly qualified
and experience staff from these industries,
we are having to provide competitive
reward packages aligned to market pay
rates.  

It is encouraging here at the College that
males and females are equally represented
at management level.

OUR COMMITMENT TO CLOSING THE GAP

Stoke on Trent College is committed to
sustained action in order to address its
gender pay gap, through reviewing and
exploring not only pay and reward but the
ways that we manage and develop our
people.  We will also seek opportunities
we can take to help the situation outside
of our organisation.

The College will work towards a range of
initiatives including:

• Seek to stimulate the pipeline of both 

genders to non-traditional areas of 
work

• Review and strengthen positive action 

statements in recruitment 
communications and processes.

• Being a better employer to improve 
ways of working to embed a healthy 
work-life balance for everyone – 
supporting individuals and teams to 
deliver their best work in a way that 
supports the quality of their personal 
life.

• Continue to monitor support for 

personal development and culture 
through staff survey and putting in 
place targeted individual, departmental
and College wide action plans.

• Strengthen mentoring arrangements, 

providing a systematic and visible 
network.

• Review of reward policies so that pay 
decisions are increasingly transparent 
and demonstrably equitable.
