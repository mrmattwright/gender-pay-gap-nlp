Workforce Race Equality Standard  Workforce Race Equality Standard  Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is committed to going beyond our the legal requirements by ensuring we make equality, diversity and human rights integral to all of our decisions.  We are therefore implementing the Equality Diversity System (EDS) as agreed by the NHS Equality and Diversity Council (EDC) and the Department of Health and have also published our Workforce Race Equality (WRES) Report. The EDS will become part of the system architecture of the NHS and NHS commissioners and providers will be issued with a set of Equality Objectives and Outcomes, against which each NHS organisation will analyse and grade its performance.  Workforce Race Equality Standard 2017 - B  Workforce Race Equality Standard 2016  Workforce Race Equality Standard  2015   The Equality Delivery System (EDS)  The Equality Delivery System (EDS)  The EDS is designed to help NHS organisations improve equality performance and embed equality into mainstream NHS businesses. The EDS is designed for the NHS by the NHS and is based on:   best practice from across industry, including the Equality Framework for local government  the views of over 660 people (including patients and staff)  reviews and reports on equality in the NHS, including guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)  learning from programmes such as Pacesetters, Breaking Through and Positively Diverse   The EDS applies to all NHS organisations, both current and planned NHS commissioning organisations, including GP Consortia, and to NHS providers including foundation trusts. By using the EDS, organisations will be able to meet the requirements of the Equality Act and be better placed to meet the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The EDS helps the NHS to deliver on:   the NHS Outcomes framework  the right and pledges of the NHS Constitution for patients and staff  addressing health inequalities in general, improving outcomes and reducing gaps   Objectives  As an outcome from the EDS and working with both internal and external stakeholders, the Trust has identified two main objectives for the next 12 months. These are:   Continue to develop and maintain communication and partnership working with external groups  Ensure managers receive appropriate training regarding equality and diversity and people management   You can find more information on the EDS and the work we have been doing below:  Download the background to the EDS here  Download the EDS action plan here   The Equality Scheme  The Equality Scheme  The NHS constitution sets out the values of the NHS. Within this, the constitution states that all NHS organisations must provide a comprehensive service available to all and it has a duty to each and every individual that it serves; respecting their human rights. The NHS constitution further sets out that NHS staff have a duty not to discriminate against patients or staff and to adhere to equal opportunities and equality and human rights legislation. This, coupled with the Equality Act 2010, has led the Trust to take a global view of its approach in relation to equality and diversity and to develop a comprehensive Equality Scheme encompassing all aspects of the equality agenda.
