At Brammer UK we strive for equality and welcome the opportunity to be visible with our information, and therefore support the government’s initiative to have companies publish Gender pay statistics.  We recognise this is a step forward in legislating for equality, and we are committed to treating our people fairly and equally in all that we do and in particular promote opportunities for development.
