Equality and Diversity       Equality and Diversity    Our ambition is to make everywhere in Amber Valley a great place to live. Central to achieving this vision is supporting equal life chances and addressing the inequalities and barriers within and between Amber Valley communities.  Our Equality and Diversity Policy Commitment sets out how we are making a difference for Amber Valley. The Council takes the opportunity each year to review what it has achieved and highlights these achievements in its annual report . Annual reports are also produced for Licensing , Planning Board , Standards and Appeals Committee and Improvement and Scrutiny Committee .  We have also reviewed how we are meeting the Public Sector Equality Duty and this is set out in the two reports below which cover 2017 and were published by 31 January 2018.

Carrying out an Equality Impact Assessment helps us find out whether an existing or proposed service/policy/activity has a negative or positive impact on different groups within the community and what we need to do to address any negative impacts.
