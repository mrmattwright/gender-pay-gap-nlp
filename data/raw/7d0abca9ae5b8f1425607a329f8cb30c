This report complies with the 2017 Government Regulations that stipulate companies in England, Scotland and Wales with 250 or more employees are required to carry out mandatory gender pay gap reporting.  This will need to be published annually showing the difference between the median and average pay of male and female employees.  Aim of this report: The data presented in this report represents the gender pay data for Gorkana UK and PR Newswire UK (part of the CisIon group), with a snapshot date of 5th April 2017. The data is compiled using our HR and payroll records.  Calculations: There are six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation.   Mean (average) gross hourly rate of pay  Median gross hourly rate of pay  Mean bonus pay  Median bonus pay  Proportion of male/female in hourly rate of pay quartiles (four bands)  Proportion of male/female in receipt of bonuses, in the 12 months before the snapshot date   The median represents the middle value within the data set. The mean represents the average value within the data set. The bonus period for the purposes of the bonus calculations is 1st April 2016 to 5th April 2017.  A positive percentage means, men are paid more than women and a negative percentage means, women are paid more than men.  What the figures say: The UK average gender pay gap in 2017 is 18.1%*. We are pleased to report that our median figure is 8.2% which is well below this average. Our median figure compares even more favourably to the technology industry average where men earn 25% more than women.  Our mean figure at 23.8% is a little above the average of 17.4%. There is no gender pay gap for the median bonus payments but the mean bonus gender pay gap is 34.5%.  Our results show that there is room for improvement and we are fully committed to reducing these pay gaps.  *Office of National Statistics 2017  Download the full report here        Get Pricing    Request a Demo        Connect on Social:           Products PR Software  PR Newswire  Journalist Services  Resources Public Relations Resources  Social Resources  Webinars & Events  About About  Leadership Team  Cision’s Gender Pay Gap Report  Media Kit  Contact  5 Churchill Place Canary Wharf E14 5HU +44 (0)20 7074 2560   Offices  Contact Us  Support     Canada (EN)  Canada (FR)  Finland  France  Germany  Norway  Portugal  Sweden  United Kingdom           Copyright © 2018 Gorkana Group Limited  Policies                    Scroll to top   Cookie Policy
