Gender Pay Report 2017

February 2018

Gender Pay Reporting

The UK Government has introduced new reporting 
regulations under the Equality Act 2010.  This 
requires UK companies with over 250 employees to 
report on their gender pay gap annually, with effect 
from April 2017. 
The gender pay gap is a measure of 
the difference in the average hourly 
rate of pay of men and women within 
Picsolve UK, regardless of the nature 
of their work.  It can be driven by the 
different number of men and women 
across all roles and is different from 
an equal pay comparison, which would 
involve direct comparison of two 
people or groups carrying out the 
same or similar work.

In the report we share the percentage 
of men and women in each pay 
quartile.  Quartiles are calculated by 
listing the rates of pay for each 
employee across the business from 
lowest to highest, before splitting that 
list into four equal-sized groups and 
calculating the percentage of males 
and females in each. 

Using the calculations set out in the 
gender pay gap reporting regulations 
(median and mean), we have taken 
pay data from our UK workforce as of 
the snapshot date of 5th April 2017 
which equated to 597 employees.  This 
data includes many different roles 
that bring a variety of rates of pay. 

These median and mean calculations 
are also carried out when comparing 
bonus pay over a twelve month period. 
The proportion of men and women 
awarded any bonus pay over that 
period is also reported.

Understanding Our Data

The average hourly rate paid to woman 
in Picsolve, taking into account all       
roles, is 27% lower than the average 
hourly rate we paid to men in April 2017.  
As a company, we are required to report 
the difference in hourly rates of pay as a 
‘median average’ – ours is 1% lower       
for woman.  

Our gender pay gap is not because we 
pay men and women unequally for  
doing equal work.  And whilst we do   
have a gender pay gap, our median 
average is below the national average. 

Of all our employees, 85% work on site 
at theme parks and attractions, with 
57% of our retail staff being female.  
Most of our retail roles are retail 
assistant positions, which are typically 
lower paid than our support centre 
and/or management roles.  

It is important to understand that the 
pay gap is much less significant in the 
largest part of our business; our retail 
sites, when the data on support centre 
and senior management employees is 
removed from the calculations.  The 
mean gender pay gap for retail then 
reduces to 4%. 

Our pay quartiles confirm that a key 
driver of our gender pay gap is that a 
significant proportion of our colleagues 
are women in hourly paid roles, while a 
higher proportion of men are in more 
senior, salaried roles.

Our pay ranges differ by function as        
well as job level, meaning that the 
gender split between functions also has 
an effect.  For example, our HR 
department is made up of 83% women, 
compared to Technology in which 6% of 
employees are female.  Like many 
companies, roles in technology, finance 
and engineering attract a higher 
proportion of men than woman. 

Our findings show that a higher 
proportion of male colleagues are in 
senior roles.  The senior roles have a 
higher bonus opportunity in percentage 
terms.  This highlights that we need to 
do more to support and encourage more 
women into senior roles.

Closing the Gap

As a Company we want to close the gender pay gap by making every role 
attractive to as many people as possible, and offering great careers to the best 
talent, regardless of gender.  We know this may take time, but initiatives which 
are already under way or which we plan to put into effect include:
•

Taking a closer look at the structure of our workforce and in particular what 
we can do to get more women into senior roles.

•

•

•

•

Offering additional training and development for frontline retail colleagues       
to advance within the organisation or apply for corporate roles within               
the Company. 

Provide unconscious bias training to employees in charge of managing 
teams and recruitment decisions.

Implement clear retention strategies and employee engagement initiatives in 
order to motivate and retain those employees who are brought into entry 
level positions.

Continue to ensure decision making on pay and recognition are       
appropriately moderated.

I confirm that the gender pay gap information provided in this report is accurate 
at the time of publishing.
