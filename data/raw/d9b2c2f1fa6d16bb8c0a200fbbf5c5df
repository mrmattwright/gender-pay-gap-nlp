Gender Pay 
Gap Report
2017

Foreword

We support equality through 
fair pay across the business.   
We are passionate about 
fairness, equality and inclusion 
and we are committed to 
reducing our gender pay gap.  

Whilst we appreciate our gap 
is lower than the UK average, 
we recognise there is still 
more we can do to reduce  
it even further.

In assessing our data it has 
allowed us to understand 
the imbalances, explain why 
the gap exists and to do 
something positive about it to 
ensure that our staff are paid 
fairly regardless of who they 
are or where they work in the 
business.

Headline gender pay gap figures
Gender pay reporting legislation  
(The Equality Act 2010, Gender Pay Gap 
Information Regulations 2017) requires  
City West Housing Trust to calculate and 
publish its gender pay gap. 

There is a statutory formula for calculating 
gender pay gap and there are no adjustments 
to account for different roles or skills. It does not 
mean that women are paid less for doing the 
same work.  It highlights the difference between 
pay of women and men purely based on gender. 

The Trust’s figures are provided in the charts 
below and are based on hourly rate of pay as  
at 5th April 2017 and bonuses paid in the  
same year. 

The mean pay gap is the difference between 
average hourly earnings of men and women.
The median pay gap is the difference 
between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly 
earnings of men and women. It takes all 
salaries in the sample, lines them up in order 
from lowest to highest, and picks the  
middle-most salary.
These figures are provided in the charts below 
together with bonus pay gap.

What are the underlying causes of our gender pay gap? 
City West Housing Trust is committed to 
organisation and the salaries that these roles 
equality and diversity and to fair treatment of 
attract. This is reflected across the UK economy 
all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion 
as a whole.
or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, 
pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender 
reassignment or disability.  We have a clear 
policy of paying employees equally for the same 
or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or 
any other characteristic set out above). 

The vast majority of organisations have a 
gender pay gap, the mean gender pay gap for 
the whole economy, according to the October 
2017 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual 
Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 
17.4%. 

We are confident that our gender pay gap 
does not stem from paying men and women 
differently for the same or equivalent work.  
Rather our gender pay gap is the result of the 
roles in which men and women work within the 

The median gender pay gap for the whole 
economy, according to the October 2017 ONS 
ASHE figures) is 18.4%. 

How are we addressing the pay gap? 
We know that we must continue to be proactive 
in our approach to all forms of diversity including 
gender and our road map of activity in this 
regard has already commenced:

•  Apprenticeships – Our employment and 

enterprise team are supporting and attracting 
apprentices into roles within construction – 
which is pre-dominantly a male dominated 
sector.  The apprenticeship programme also 
now provides an opportunity for exiting staff to 
re-train and embark on a new career. 

•  Living Wage Employer – We are proud to 
be a Living Wage employer, ensuring that 
employees in lower paid roles are receiving 
higher pay as recommended by the Living 
Wage Foundation. 

•  Flexible Working Practices – The organisation 

has a suite of comprehensive policies and 
procedures in place to support staff, ensuring 
that flexible working arrangements are in place 
and a robust support system for staff with 
caring responsibilities or experiencing major 
life events across all sections of the workforce. 

•  Diversity in Business Accreditation – City West 

Housing Trust is DiBA Exemplar accredited 
– demonstrating both commitment and the 
work put in to ensuring equality and diversity 
across all employment practices.  

•  Learning and Development – Our Learning 

and Development team is committed to 
supporting the development of all staff across 
the organisation. The team facilitates a range 
of learning and development opportunities, 
including classroom courses, lunch and 
learns, bespoke interventions and e-learning 
to support the development of all staff. 
The organisation also seeks to enhance its 
leadership capability and is currently doing this 
through both an Excellence Academy and a 
Senior Leadership Development Programme.

•  Women in Management – The number of 

women in operational management roles is 
higher than males and it is expected that this 
will allow for natural progression for female 
staff into senior management positions.

•  Review and Monitoring of pay and benefits 
across the organisation –The organisation 
operates a system of job evaluation and 
regularly reviews its pay against market data 
and it ensure it pays equal pay regardless of 
gender to staff carrying out the same work.

•  New Reward & Recognition Strategy  

– In December 2017 the Group’s Executive 
Team authorised a full review of the reward 
and recognition practices within the Group. 
The work is being headed up by a reward 
specialist and will see the development of a 
new reward and recognition strategy that will 
seek to further address the gender pay gap.

  The project team is focusing on the 

following areas:

  –  Reward (base pay structures) 

  –  Recognition

  – 

Job Design / Job Families

  –  Career Paths 

  – 

Talent Management

There is still a lot more to do and we will 
continue to focus on building a more diverse 
workforce and inclusive culture within  
the Trust.
