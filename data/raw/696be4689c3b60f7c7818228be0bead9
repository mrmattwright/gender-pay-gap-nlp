Introduction by Brendan Sarsfield, CEO 
 

Family Mosaic is one of London’s largest housing associations, and is part of Peabody following our 
merger in July 2017. We own over 26,000 affordable rented homes, housing around 45,000 people. 
We also provide a wide range of specialist housing, and care and support services, to around 8,000 
people across London and the South East.  

Everything we do is driven by our social purpose, and our mission to help people make the most of 
their lives by providing good quality homes, working with communities and promoting wellbeing.  

As an organisation that strives to listen to and know our customers, it’s so important that we reflect 
the diversity of the people and communities that we serve. 

At the same time, we care for our people and know that they are our greatest asset.  That’s why we 
are committed to engaging, motivating and involving our people at every level of the organisation. 
By investing in and empowering our employees, we can help them to develop both professionally 
and personally, giving them the skills and confidence to reach their ambitions.  

We want to be an organisation that people want to work for and are proud to work for.  

Our Gender Pay Gap Report shows that we have a gender pay gap. The nature of our care and 
support business means that we employ many women at the lower end of our pay scale, which 
increases our gender pay gap. However, further up our organisation women are also very well 
represented. Overall, our organisation is made up of 68% women, with our highest pay band being 
53% female and our second highest being 77% female.  

While having great female representation at the very top levels of our organisation is something to 
be proud of, we know that there is more that we can and will do.  

Having recently launched our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, we are well positioned to 
continue supporting and promoting diversity and equality, making sure women are even better 
represented throughout Family Mosaic, particularly at the very highest levels.   

We welcome the introduction of the Gender Pay Gap Report as an important step to tackling 
inequality in the workplace and I look forward to working with my colleagues to enhance our 
reputation as an equal opportunities employer.   

 

  

 

  

 

 

Gender Pay Gap Report 
 

New government legislation requires companies with more than 250 employees to release data on 
their gender pay gap based on data from April 2017.  

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average pay of men and women across our 
business; it’s not a comparison of pay rates between men and women doing the same job.  

We are confident that Family Mosaic supports equality through fair pay.

The finer details

at the higher levels of the organisation, our lowest paid band is also 76% female.

Mean and median gender pay gap 
The gender pay gap is the difference between the mean or median hourly pay of men and women.  
The mean pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women while 
the median pay gap is the difference between the middle-most salary of men and women, when all 
salaries are lined up from lowest to highest.

The charts above show Family Mosaic’s mean and median gender pay gap in pounds and 
percentages. As you can see, Family Mosaic has a mean gender pay gap of 20.1% and a median of 
19.4%, meaning that on average - across our organisation – men are paid more than women.  When 
looking at the mean figure, men are paid an average of £3.07 more per hour than women and the 
median shows an average of £2.59 more per hour. While this appears to be a large gender pay gap, 
it’s only slightly above average when compared to the Office for National Statistic’s Annual Survey of 
Hours and Earnings.  

Percentage of male and female employees in each pay band 
The main reason we have an above average gender pay gap is that despite women being well 
represented throughout our two highest pay bands (making up 65% of the workforce) they also 
predominate our two lowest pay bands (making up 75% of the workforce), creating a gender pay 
gap.  

This is quite common in the care and support industry, where women tend to make up the bulk of 
the frontline workforce. This means that our organisational shape translates into a gender pay gap 
because despite women being well represented at senior and middle manager levels in our 
organisation, they hugely outnumber men in lower-paid frontline roles.

With women making up over half of our most senior employees, Family Mosaic has many female 
role models at every level of our organisation to inspire, encourage and mentor more junior 
employees.

Bonus pay gap figures are calculated from data for the full 12 months until April 2017. As you can 
see, men were more likely to receive a bonus than women; however, in pure numbers, more women 
across the organisation received a bonus than men.  

There was a proportionately higher gap in our mean and median bonus compared to our pay gap. 
The reason for this is explained by the size of our care and support business, compared to the rest of 
our organisation.   

 

 

 

Our next steps 
 

Family Mosaic always strives to be an inclusive, equal and fair employer with a diverse workforce. 
We know there is more to do to reduce our gender pay gap as much as possible and ensure women 
are represented at all levels of our organisation, especially in senior leadership positions.  

Over the next year, we will continue to integrate our organisation following our merger with 
Peabody, and will begin reporting as one organisation.  We’ll also form a new subsidiary, Peabody 
South East which we will report on separately.  

We will continue to support the development of a strong group of female employees who can 
compete for more senior positions as they become available by: 

  Updating our job evaluation scheme and pay structure for the new combined organisation. 

This will provide us with accurate and robust information to make sure that job grading and 
pay structures continue to be fair and equitable.  
 

  Sponsoring women to attend seminars and to gain qualifications in leadership, as well as 
relevant technical and professional qualifications. By improving skills, building confidence 
and supporting the professional development of our employees, they will be in a better 
position to compete for more senior roles and progress their careers.  
 

  Promote and encourage women to develop networks and train more employees to 

mentor others. By having women that are: well connected at every level of our organisation, 
positive role models for other employees and empowered to mentor the next generation, 
we will foster a culture of inclusivity and fairness, while upskilling our workforce.  
 

  Promote our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy, including our Gender and Families 

networks. These networks, along with our strategy, will be an important mechanism for 
encouraging equality, diversity and inclusion throughout the organisation, championing 
various causes and promoting events like International Women’s Day.  
 

  Ensuring consistency throughout business areas of our bonus award, including a review of 
the gender balance. This will help us make sure that our new bonus system is fair and equal 
regardless of gender.
