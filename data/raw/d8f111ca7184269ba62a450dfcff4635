The figures clearly show that there is a significantly low proportion of female employees across all 
quartiles, which reflects the fact that almost 83% of our workforce is either site or yard-based for which 
there is little, or no female participation on an industry-wide scale.

Lyndon currently compares favourably to the rest of the construction industry and to the wider national 
position on both mean and median measures. 

The company is committed to providing equal opportunities and has a clear policy of paying employees 
equally for the same or equivalent work, wherever possible ensuring that all employees receive market 
rates of pay in line with their location and role. Therefore it is expected that the business will remain ahead 
of both the industry and national position for the foreseeable future. 

 

I, Keith Addis, Financial Director, confirm that the gender pay gap data contained in this report for Lyndon 
Scaffolding plc is accurate and has been produced in accordance with the guidance on managing gender 
pay developed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Service (ACAS).
