Puncture holes and deep gouges into the walls require regular filling, sanding and painting. The repair process can take four days or more, often requiring the whole wall to be re-painted, causing much disruption to patient care.

The centres offer a range of complementary therapies to patients in an environment of peace and tranquillity, including counselling, reflexology, aromatherapy, manual lymphatic drainage and support groups. The centres are for patients with all types of cancer at all stages, whether newly diagnosed or longer term, throughout and after completion of treatment. Founded in 1999, the charity is the legacy of BBC broadcaster Helen Rollason.
