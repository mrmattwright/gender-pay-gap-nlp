INTEGRATED PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY REPORT 

The Integrated Performance and Quality report providing an update on

Good which is an improved position from the initial assessment of 
needs improvement.  

3.  Following a discussion at the last GB meeting, it was confirmed 

that the Quality Premium indicators are based on: 

•  Nationally set indicators with defined targets aligned to the 
CCG IAF and designed to support the major priorities set 
out in the Five Year Forward View and NHS Mandate; 
•  Locally agreed measures chosen from the Right Care 

Programme with CCG improvement targets agreed with 
NHSE (which may differ from targets identified in the

6.  The Governing Body expressed concern with the A&E 

performance at PAH and was assured that substantial support 
from the national team is being provided. 

7.  The success of the GP triage element of Accident & Emergency 

(A&E) was questioned, and it was noted that the models are 
developing and being monitored and are becoming established. 
8.  It was noted that admissions from nursing homes are lower than 

other CCGs’ admissions, demonstrating the positive impact of 
work within the localities in nursing homes

FINANCE REPORT 

The Finance Report Month 8 2017/18 was reviewed 

1.  The CCG financial position as at Month 8 is an in-year surplus of 

£184k which is in addition to the cumulative brought forward 
plan.  The CCG is forecasting to deliver an underspend of 
£14,498k, to meet the NHS England (NHSE) target control total 

2.  The Governing Body referred to Elective and Emergency 

predictive spends and was reassured that recommendations to 
continue urgent work have been made and associated risks have 
been considered. Emergency patients and cancer patients and 
mental health patients are a priority

9. 

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK 

The Medium Term Financial Outlook was presented as outlined in the 
report 

1.  The Governing Body’s attention was drawn to cost pressures 

brought forward from 2017/18, the key activity demand 
assumptions, inflation and changes in funding leading to an 
estimated Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention  
(QIPP) challenge of £14m in 2018/19 and an additional £5-6m in 
each of 2019/20 and 2020/21. This compared to a £23m 
requirement in 2017/18. 

2.  The ageing population and increased demand for Continuing 

Healthcare was noted. 

3.  The impact on the wider health system and Providers was 

discussed. It was noted that the CCG’s challenge was effectively 
to maintain overall acute service demand at the current levels 
even though the population was increasing and ageing. For 
acute providers the challenge was to maintain and reduce 
expenditure even though pay awards, inflation and other cost 
pressures would otherwise increase it. 

4.  The importance of digitalisation and information sharing to drive 
transformation and efficiency was highlighted. It was noted that 
the STP had a digital technology work stream and was tasked 
with developing and improving use of technology to drive 
efficiency and patient safety. 

The Governing Body noted the financial outlook for 2018/19 to 2020/21 
compared to 2017/18

The following recommendations were considered 

That the CCG and the HR and ODL Shared Service consider 
ways of addressing the falling proportion of BME appointees by 
looking to identify any reasons for the change in the level of 
BME recruitment and consider career development 
opportunities within the CCG for BME staff to support retention.  
The CCG may also consider routes to promotion and work life 
balance for female employees and the retention of staff aged 
20-39 

8.  Work is undertaken to reduce the number of employees not 
declaring their equalities status in some categories.  This will 
help to produce better quality data across all categories of the 
equalities monitoring framework 

The Governing Body noted the findings of the report and approved to 
investigate the recommendations 

11.

11/01/2017:  The PMOT suggest that we should reinstate 
the 2016/17 antibiotic prescribing performance indicator 
for ‘broad spectrum antibiotics’. This is still monitored by 
NHSE but is no longer part of the Quality Premium. The 
target is still set at 10%. Whether this is to be an 
incentivised KPI under the CFF or just part of the PMOT 
monthly monitoring schedule with practices is to be 
confirmed.
18/01/2018: Ongoing
01/03/2018 Primary Care Medicines Management 
Group (PCMMG) supported the PMOT 
recommendation that the antibiotic prescribing 
performance indicator for ‘broad spectrum 
antibiotics’ be an incentivised metric under the 
Consolidated Funding Framework for 2018-19. The 
recommendation was to set the target at 10% of total 
antibacterial prescribing. This is in line with the 
NHSE ‘Improvement and Assessment Framework’

13/03/2018:  Work has started on the findings around 
BME recruitment. A meeting has been arranged with 
Louise Dent, Recruitment and HR Operations 
Manager, for 21 March to look at the recruitment 
process and where there may be scope for differing 
outcomes. This will guide further work. 
Work on the reasons for BME staff leaving and 
retention or younger employees is linked to on going 
work on appraisals and talent development. We will 
continue to monitor these areas to identify where, 
and how, we may be able to  improve retention, 
where appropriate.
When looking at work/life balance we saw a reduction 
in the number of female employees working part time 
but an increase in the number of male employees 
working part time. This indicates an awareness of the 
part time working offer, and we will continue to 
monitor this.  This action can be closed.

Comments ׀ 
 
A&E 
There  is  a  national  requirement  that  95%  of  patients  attending  A&E  are  treated,  admitted  or  transferred  within  4  hours  of  arrival. 
Performance has been challenging at both ENHT and PAH due to pressures over the winter period. Nationally there is now an expectation 
that all trusts will meet 90% by September 2018 and 95% by March 2019. This will require both trusts to submit a revised trajectory. 
 
Stroke 
The 90% of time on a stroke unit target continues to be met and ENHT saw an improvement in the 4 hours direct to stroke unit target in 
December 2017, achieving 78.8%. This level of performance continues to compare well to that reported nationally. ENHT retained it’s A 
Rating on SSNAP for the period August to November 2017.   
 
RTT  
Under the NHS constitution there is a performance target related to patients still waiting for treatment; the target being that 92% are to 
have been waiting for less than 18 weeks. This target was narrowly missed at CCG level for December. Performance was met at PAH for 
December, but ENHT continues to be unable to report on its RTT position following the implementation of Lorenzo in September 2017. 
 
Cancer 
At CCG level, performance was met against the 62 day waiting time standard for the first time in 2017-18 in December. Performance at 
ENHT was also the highest it has been for December and performance at PAH was 96.7%, well ahead of the 85% standard.

Performance 
Although the CCG has to report on RTT performance at CCG level, the 
figures do not include ENHT data which accounts for the majority of 
ENHCCG activity. 
 
The  eleven  52  week  breaches,  attributed  to  ENHCCG  patients  have 
been identified at the following trusts: 
 
Royal Free: 
Mid Essex: 
Oxford University: 
 
The  CCG  has  asked  for  conformation  that  all  of  the  patients  have 
either  been treated or  have  a  date  for their  treatment.  In  addition, 
the  CCG  will  seek  assurance  that  clinical  harm  reviews  are 
undertaken  to  ensure  that  no  patients  have  suffered  harm  as  a 
consequence of waiting for than 52 weeks for treatment.

100+ Day Cancer Waits ENHCCG Patients  

Comments ׀  
 
Performance 
The  62  day  standard  from  referral  to  first  treatment  was  met  for  the 
first  time  in  2017-18  in  December  at  CCG  level,  although  this  fell  to 
82.8%  in  January.  The  screening  referral  standard  also  fell  in  January. 
January  performance  is  often  lower  as  a  result  of  higher  than  usual 
numbers of patients deferring treatment over the Christmas period.  
 
Despite  the  numbers  being  low  for  November  and  December,  the 
number of 100+ day cancer waits went up in January to 8 with 7.5 of 
these  attributable  to  East  and  North  Herts  Trust  and  0.5  to  Royal 
Brompton.  Processes  are  in  place  between  ENHT  and  the  CCG  to 
undertake  clinical  harm  reviews  for  patients  who  have  been  waiting 
more than 100 days for treatment.

Comments ׀  
 
Performance 
There  is  a  national  constitutional  requirement  that  95%  of  patients 
attending A&E are treated, admitted or transferred within 4 hours of 
arrival.  Performance  at  CCG  level  largely  reflects  performance  at 
ENHT  but  will  also  include  ENHCCG  patients  attending  other  A&E 
departments  such  as  PAH  and  the  RFH.  Performance  has  fallen  for 
December  at  74.4%  at  CCG  level  as  a  consequence  of  significant 
pressures within the system.  
 
Actions 
ENHCCG  has  a  Systems  Resilience  Group  (SRG)  that  meets  monthly 
and is responsible for the day-to-day delivery of the actions outlined 
in  the  Urgent  and  Emergency  (UEC)  Delivery  Plan  2017/18.  It  is 
accountable to the East & North Hertfordshire Accident & Emergency 
Delivery Board. Local system actions have been agreed in line with the 
national urgent and emergency care delivery plan. Additional services 
have  been  in  place  throughout  the  winter  period  to  improve  urgent 
care access and maintain patient safety.  
 
Recovery 
Nationally  the  requirement  for  all  trusts  to  be  delivering  the  95% 
standard  has  been  pushed  back  with  trusts  now  expected  to  meet 
90% by September 2018 and 95% by March 2019.

Comments  ׀  
 
Performance 
New  ambulance  performance  standards  to  measure  ambulance 
response times have been in operation for 2 months. There are 4 new 
categories of call with associated required average response times: 
 
C1 People with life threatening injuries and illness (<7 minutes) 
C2 Emergency calls (<18 minutes) 
C3 Urgent calls (<120 minutes) 
C4 Less urgent calls (<180 minutes) 
There has been an improvement  
 
There  has  been  a  further  drop  in  waiting  times  performance  in 
December  against  all  call  categories  at  CCG  level  with  none  of  the 
waiting times standards being met. This is reflective of the significant 
pressures that that the ambulance service has been under throughout 
the winter period.

Comments  ׀  
 
Performance 
The number of people entering treatment in December  for HPFT  was 
over target by 33. 
 
The AQP access data is a month behind and has not been included in 
the December figures which is why the chart shows the CCG under the 
target line.   
 
The Year to date target has been exceeded by 1,266.  
 
The CCG is currently achieving a recovery rate of 52.6% which is above 
the set national target of 50%.   
 
Actions 
No actions are required as the CCG is exceeding the set KPI’s for IAPT 
access  and recovery YTD.

Performance 
• East – The One Stop pathway which commenced on the 8th January 
is having a very positive impact on waiting times with 97.67% seen 
within  6  weeks.  North:  Staff  have  been  allocated  to  vacant  posts 
following a redeployment exercise. Dates are yet to be confirmed. 

• Assessment waiting compliance data is just below target at 87.91%.  
• Diagnostic appointments are delivering above target; this in part is 

to support the East transfer to the One Stop pathway. 

• Diagnostic  waiting  list  numbers  continue  to  decrease  and  are  the 

lowest number in over 14 months. 

• Clinic diagnostic rates are showing a further drop with a diagnosis 

rate of 66.18% for the last 6 weeks.  

• Diagnostic  Appointment  Waiting  Times  <12  week  Diagnostic 
Waiting  Target:  total  numbers  on  the  waiting  list  continue  to 
decrease and are the lowest number in over 14 months. 

 
Actions 
• Practice  visits  have  been  undertaken  by  the  team  in  order  to 
challenge the low dementia diagnosis in East and North Herts. The 
first wave of visits  have been carried out for Q1-3  and more are 
planned for Q4. 

• A dementia coding exercise  will be sent out to surgeries to support 
GPs to identify errors in coding, which are contributing to low rates 
of dementia diagnosis on practice registers. 

 
Recovery 
•

January  4,262 (64.1%)  down from December 4,289 (64.2%). East 
and  North  are  behind  the  trajectory  December  target  66.7%,

Comments ׀ 
 
Clostridium difficile 
The number of C-diff cases reported within the ENHCCG population is currently 
at  its  highest  point  for  the  last  5  years.  During  the  months  of  June  to  October 
2017, there was a notable sharp increase in cases. However, this appears to have 
slowed slightly. By the end of January, the 2017/18 cumulative rate of infection 
per  100,000  population  was  19.98,  which  was  slightly  below  the  national  rate, 
but  slightly  above  that  of  the  East  of  England  region*.  The  percentage  of 
community reported cases is currently 75% of the total number reported. 
 
*2 cases have been identified as duplicates and the appropriate trusts have been requested to 
remove  these.  Once  removed,  the  monthly  total  cases  for  January  will  be  13  and  the  rate  of 
infection will also fall. 
 
A  monthly  IPC  Focus  Group,  chaired  by  the  Director  of  Nursing  &  Quality  has 
been  established  to  monitor  progress  against  IPC  action  plans  and  address  any 
challenges or difficulties encountered in achieving these. 
 
 

Targeted actions to address local C-diff rates: 
• Review of risk factors for each case by Head of IPC. 
• Review of recent primary care antibiotic history requested. 
•

The Antimicrobial Pharmacy Advisor, Head of IPC and local Microbiologist 
are  being  booked  to  present  regarding  C  diff,  antibiotic  prescribing  and 
antimicrobial resistance at each of the next Target events. 

• Advice regarding the re-sampling of positive cases is being included in GP 

•

•
•

•

newsletter. 
CCG C-diff Appeals Panel terms of reference are currently being reviewed 
and updated. 
Trust proton pump inhibitor policies have been reviewed. 
CCG  primary  care  proton  pump  inhibitor  guidance  is  currently  being 
reviewed. 
Process  for  monitoring  progress  against  trust  C  diff  action  plans  is  being 
tightened. 

• All trust C diff action plans will now be shared with other Nursing & Quality 
Team  members  so  that  actions  can  also  be  monitored  during  Quality 
Assurance Visits i.e. completeness of patient stool charts etc. 

• Re-introduction  of  broad  spectrum  antibiotic  prescribing  measure  into 
2018/19 CFF i.e. number of co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins and quinolones 
as  a  percentage  of  the  total  number  of  selected  antibiotics  prescribed  in 
primary care to be 10% or below. 

 
MRSA Blood Stream Infection (BSI) 
A total of 6 MRSA BSIs have been reported between April and January 2018, 
against a zero tolerance. This equates to a rate of 1.06 per 100,000 population 
which  is  below both national and regional rates.  A  post  infection review  has 
been undertaken for each case.  One case has been reported since November.  
This case was likely to have been a urosepsis, but was complicated by the fact 
that the patient had refused hospital admission. Actions that were identified 
were: 
 
• HCT  to  further  investigate  prescription  by  non-medical  prescriber,  and  if 

•
•

necessary consider additional training.  
ENHT to address why sepsis pathway was not followed. 
ENHT to address omitted MRSA screen. MRSA policy to be reviewed (trust 
considering move to universal MRSA admission screening). 

 
The quarterly IPC Group will monitor progress against these actions.

Escherichia coli Blood Stream Infection (BSI): 
 
By the end of  January 2018, the number of cases reported  within the CCG 
remained above ceiling for that point in the year. However, the CCG had a 
rate of 55.69 per  100,000 population which is below the regional rate and 
significantly  below  the  national  rate.  As  expected  85%  of  all  cases  were 
assigned  to  the  community,  and  approximately  50%  have  a  recorded 
primary source of upper or lower urinary tract. This is reflective of national 
surveillance  data  also.  The  CCG  IPC  Focus  Group  has  reviewed  this 
surveillance data and monitors targeted action plan. 
 
Targeted actions to address local rates of E coli BSI: 
•

Establishment  of  Hertfordshire  wide  UTI  Best  Practice  Forum  which  is 
chaired  by  the  CCG  and  held  monthly.  Its  membership 
includes 
representatives from  all main providers in Hertfordshire.  The work plan 
for this group includes: 

 

 
 

Increase the utilisation of urinary catheter passports 

•
• Production of a primary care catheter formulary 
• Review of trail without catheter services 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• Review of use of bladder scanners across the community 
• Review  of  audit  results  for  UTI  and  catheter  audits  at  ENHT 

being undertaken by the CCG 

• Audit of discharge processes for catheterised patients 
• Replication  of  Stevenage  UTI  Pathway  Project  across  other 

localities 
Education for UTI prevention across the community 

•
• Review  of  trends  in  numbers  of  patients  discharged  with 

catheters 

•

• A  trial  of  the  “To  dip  or  not  to  dip”  (TDONTD)  programme  was 
undertaken at a care home in Bishop Stortford. Whilst numbers were 
relatively  low,  data  showed  a  78%  reduction  in  the  number  of  ‘UTI 
antibiotic’  items  prescribed  in  the  corresponding  seven  months 
before and after the introduction of the programme. The number of 
patients prescribed ‘UTI antibiotics’ also fell by 67%. In the same time 
period UTI related admissions fell by 67%. and there were no deaths 
in  the  care  home  where  death  certificates  listed  urosepsis  /  UTI 
related issues. 
TDONTD has been launched across ENH within primary care and care 
homes  during  2017/18.  However,  only  approx  30%  of  ENH  care 
homes  attended  training  provided  by  the  CCG  through  HCPA.  A 
business case is therefore currently being developed to fund a series 
of educational events for care homes  and home care staff to  include 
TDONTD,  as  well  as  wider  issues  that  will  help  to  reduce  UTI  and  E 
coli  BSI  locally  i.e.  recognising  the  deteriorating  resident/patient, 
improving hydration and urinary catheter care. It is planned that the 
business case will be taken to the CCG executive team during March 
2018, with a view to holding the events in May/ June 18 if approved. 
• Antibiotic  guidance  for  the  treatment  of  UTIs  &  the  Hertfordshire 

Antibiotic App has been updated and re-launched. 

• Acute  providers  have  commenced  recording  surveillance  data  on 

•

acute and community acquired cases of E coli BSI. 
The  production  of  CCG  UTI  prophylaxis  guidance 
underway for primary care. 

is  currently 

• Contact  has  been  made  to  try  to  establish  what  learning  can  be 

gained from the PAHT experience i.e. very low rates of E coli BSI.

ENHCCG | Safeguarding Adults 

Comments ׀  
Following the Domestic Abuse Topic Group session in December the following recommendations were made: 
 
•

•
•

To introduce Domestic Abuse (DA) Champions county wide including GPs That DA training and awareness raising is adopted by the HSAB as part of mandatory 
safeguarding training for operational front line staff and managers across Adult Care Services (ACS); and, that all relevant contracts build in DA training as a 
mandatory requirement.  
That the Hertfordshire DA Partnership actively creates support services for medium and standard risk victims.  
That  work  should  be  undertaken  with  Princess  Alexandra  Hospital,  Luton  and  Dunstable  Hospital  and  Barnet  General  Hospital  to  identify  and  develop 
improved communications with the service that performs a similar function to that of the Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) at the Lister and 
Watford hospitals.  
That the partnership develops a countywide non-mandatory perpetrator programme.  

•
 
The Head of Adult Safeguarding is developing a safeguarding adult strategy setting out expectations for the next 3 years in line with the CCG objectives. 
 
Following the letter from NHSE wanting to understand the progress that NHS organisations have made in reaching compliance with the Prevent Duty, the Head 
of Adult Safeguarding received the following  assurance from all four trusts; All organisations uploaded prevent data to Unify2 within the timescales set by NHSE. 
All organisations continue to work towards the 85% compliance target for prevent training. 
The Head of Adult Safeguarding organised for Prevent Wrap training for key staff from provider organisations to improve the delivery of Prevent Wrap training. 
 
The Named Nurse for Adult Safeguarding is working with colleagues to provide adult safeguarding training at primary care Target days. This includes having stalls 
at Locality events.  The Named Nurse is also supporting several GP practices to produce reports for  Domestic Homicide Reviews and shares the  learning with 
them. 
The  Safeguarding  Adult  Team  continue  to  support  the  Hertfordshire  Safeguarding  Adult  Board  at  a  number  of  sub  groups  which  include  reviewing  policies, 
developing learning events, raising awareness and reviewing Safeguarding Adult Reviews. 
  
All  providers  continue  to  work  towards  their  compliance  targets  for  Adult  Safeguarding  and  Prevent  Training  which  are  monitored  by  the  Head  of  Adult 
Safeguarding through the quarterly dashboards. The main area of concern is regarding Prevent training and ENHT and HPFT have provided action plans outlining 
how they will meet the NHSE targets for Prevent Training.

ENHCCG | Safeguarding Children 

Comments ׀  
•

The  Designated  Office  is  involved  in  a  number  of  work  streams,  in  collaboration  with  partner  agencies  and  the  Hertfordshire  Safeguarding  Children  Board 
(HSCB).  Examples  include  Safeguarding  Supervision  and  Management  Oversight;  Scoping  of  self  harm;  Domestic  Homicide  Review;  Private  Fostering; 
Preparation for the Joint Targeted Area Inspection (JTAI) and Harmful Sexualised Behaviour. 
Two Serious Case Reviews (SCRs) are currently in progress, with a third recently declared. Two further individual cases are being progressed as multi-agency 
investigations (as opposed to SCRs).  
Section 11 visits for 2018 have been arranged. Two have been completed. Action plans to improve quality of Safeguarding practice will be formulated where 
necessary and are monitored by the Designated Office. Recent actioned concerns have been in relation to training compliance and  safeguarding supervision 
offer. 

•

•

• Audit scheduling, for 2018/2019, for Provider services, based on recommendations from Section 11 visits, will continue.  
•

Safeguarding Assurance Tool (SAT) – all key standards in relation to CCG Safeguarding practices reportable to NHS England, are currently rated as Green as of 
November 2017 for Safeguarding Children. Two areas remain Amber for Looked After Children (LAC) whilst a health needs analysis is awaited. 

• A fundamental review of the role and functions of Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) and an exploration of the child death review process (Wood 
Report 2016) has made recommendations for centralisation of SCR information to support a national learning framework and a move of ownership of the 
arrangements for supporting Child Death Overview Panels (CDOP) from the Department of Education to the Department of Health. A full consultation, 
regarding progression of future arrangements for CDOP panels, is being led by NHS England and is expected to complete in Spring 2018. The consultation 
process has highlighted a number of professional concerns including lack of statutory guidance for implementation, lack of governance arrangements, change 
in roles and responsibilities of Designated Doctors and a shift in how review meetings (first meeting following a child death) are managed. Further information 
is awaited following conclusion of the consultation process.  

• A review of the functions of the Hertfordshire Safeguarding Children Board (HSCB), and it’s relationship with the Adult Board is currently being undertaken by 

•

the HSCB chair. A preliminary report is expected in Spring 2018. 
The  CCG  Safeguarding  Children  Training  Strategy  has  been  revised,  with  additional  information  enclosed  regarding  Primary  Care.  Relevant  ratification 
processes will be progressed to enable sign off.  

• Ongoing support is being offered to GP practices to ensure completion of the registration process for identified Female Genital Mutilation. Bespoke training is 

offered to GP practices as required.  

• A  number  of  Primary  Care  specialist  conferences    are  presently  being  arranged.  These  will  include  Harmful  Sexualised  Behaviour  in  Children  and    Prevent 

•

Awareness. Three multi-agency conferences, in collaboration with the LMC , are also in the planning stages.  
Looked After Children (LAC) – Completion rates for Initial and Review LAC health assessments are in excess of 80%. Delay in completion of Out of County health 
assessments continues to be of concern. A clear escalation process involving NHS England and host CCGs is in place to improve the current situation. Quarter 3 
figures currently stand at 14% completion within timescale.  

• A new Designated Doctor, haws been recruited.

Performance 
ENHT saw an improvement in the 4 hours direct to stroke unit target in 
December 2017, achieving 78.8%. This level of performance continues 
to compare well to that reported nationally (59.5%).  
 
Performance  against  scanning  metrics  saw  a  reduction  in  December 
2017. ENHT undertook 72.5% of urgent scans within an hour during the 
month,  with  a  total  of  95%  of  patients  scanned  within  24  hours.  It  is 
believed that performance will recover over the coming months. 
 
Thrombolysis within 3-4.5 hours continues to be below the 12% target, 
with  achievement  of  8.6%  in  December  2017;  the  highest  rate  since 
June  2017.  In  total,  11.4%  of  eligible  patients  were  thrombolysed, 
which is comparable to the national rate of 11.1%.  
 
45.0% of all TIA patients were seen within 24 hours in December 2017, 
and 97.5% within 72 hours. ENHT retained its ‘A Rating’ on SSNAP for 
the period August to November 2017. 
 
Actions 
Stroke  nurses  have  now  completed  the  relevant  training  in  order  to 
directly  request  CT  scans.  A  pilot  of  this  pathway  has  started,  and  is 
expected  to  support  both  scanning  and  4  hours  direct  to  stroke  unit 
targets.

TIA attendance within 24 hours is affected by both patient choice, and 
late  GP  referral.  ENHT  is  reporting  on  those  GP  practices  that  are 
referring  late  for  TIA,  in  order  for  the  CCG  to  support  timely  referral. 
Work is also underway to develop a patient information leaflet for TIA, 
outlining  the  symptoms  and  importance  of  presentation  within  24 
hours.  
 
ENHT continues to actively recruit into the Stroke Service, and has 15 
overseas  nurses  due  to  start  in  February  2018.  It  is  also  continuing 
active recruitment of a further Stroke Consultant. 
 
Recovery 
ENHT continues to work towards achievement and sustainment of 80-
85% against the 4 hour target.

Performance 
Although there was a dip in performance in December against the 2 
week  wait  for  breast  symptomatic  referrals,  this  was  back  on  track 
for January.  
 
The  31  day  standards  for  both  subsequent  surgery  and  subsequent 
radiotherapy  remain  below  target.  The  31  day  standard  from 
decision to treat to  first  definitive treatment  was met  in December 
but this fell just under the required 96% in January.

Performance 
Patients  should  receive  first  definitive  treatment  within  62  days  of 
the referral being received and the national standard for this metric 
is  85%.  The  trust  has  failed  to  meet  the  62  day  standard  for  first 
definitive  treatment  since  April  2015,  although  performance  in 
November  and  December  was  above  80%  post  application  of  the 
Inter Trust Transfer Policy (ITTP) which reallocates breaches to trusts 
referring  after  day  38  in  the  pathway.  January  performance  has 
dipped at 76.6% post ITTP but the trust is expecting this to improve 
in February. 
 
Actions 
Joint  work  across  the  Trust  and  CCG  continues  on  the  timed 
pathways  for  lung  and  prostate  cancers  which,  once  established, 
should  see  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  breaches.  The  trust  is 
producing  a  monthly  analysis  of  performance  at  tumour  site  level 
which  is  reviewed  by  the  CCG  at  patient  level  to  identify  the  main 
reasons  for  breaches  and  to  ensure  pathways  are  improved  and 
breach numbers reduced.  
 
A  peer  review  of  the  patient  tracking  list  processes  has  been 
undertaken  with  good  progress  being  made  to  date  and  additional  
brachytherapy capacity has been sourced. The trust is on track with 
its  radiotherapy  review  which  should  identify  demand  and  capacity 
issues within the diagnostic phase of the pathway.  
 
Recovery 
The  Contract  performance  Notice  remains  in  place  and  the  Trust  is 
still  confident  that  it  will  achieve  85%  by  March  as  detailed  in  the 
Remedial Action Plan.

Performance 
A&E  performance  in  December  2017  and  January  2018,  fell  below 
the  agreed  recovery  trajectory.  ENHT  achieved  77.2%  in  December 
2017 against a recovery target of 92.6%, and 82.0% in January 2018 
against a trajectory of 93.4%.  
 
Actions 
A  Contract  Performance  Notice  was  issued  to  ENHT  in  December 
2017, which resulted in the Trust submitting a Remedial Action Plan 
(RAP)  to  detail  the  key  actions  that  will  be  undertaken  to  improve 
performance. These actions include:  
• The redesign of the front door at Lister A&E to better support the 
effective streaming of patients to the right part of the urgent care 
system; 
Increased  utilisation  of  supporting  urgent  care  pathways, 
including ambulatory care, frailty and discharge home to assess; 

•

• Capacity  and  demand  modelling  of  assessment  space  within  the 

•

Trust; 
Implementation  of  professional  standards  and  escalation 
protocols. 

  
There  are  a  number  of  joint  urgent  care  work  programmes  to  be 
progressed  over  the  coming  months  by  the  CCG  and  ENHT,  which 
will support A&E performance including the launch of model hospital 
programme in March 2018.  
 
Recovery 
ENHT is currently towards a trajectory that seeks to achieve 95% by 
the  end  of  March  2018.  However,  recent  guidance  suggests  that 
nationally, this expectation has been revised to achievement of 90% 
by September 2018 and 95% by March 2019.

Performance 
ENHT  saw  a  reduction  in the  performance of ambulance  handovers 
during December 2017 and January 2018, with 41.0% and 41.2% of 
clinical  handovers  completed  within  15  minutes  respectively. 
Additionally,  there  were  53  delays  over  60  minutes  during  January 
2018.  Whilst  performance  has  reduced  compared  to  previous 
months,  it  is  a  significant  improvement  on  2016-17  and  still 
compares favourably to regional performance. 
 
Due to the implementation of the Ambulance Response Programme 
in  October  2017,  ambulance  handover  information  is  not  available 
for October or November 2017. 
 
Actions 
The A&E RAP includes actions to improve ambulance flows at ENHT. 
Additionally,  a  new  standard  operating  procedure  for  arrival  to 
handover delays has been implemented on 26 February 2018, which 
introduces  clear  processes  and  escalation  points  to  support  clinical 
handover  within  15  minutes.  The  CCG  is  working  with  ENHT  to 
ensure  appropriate  staffing  is  in  place  to  support  the  ambulance 
pathway. 
 
Recovery 
The  CCG  will  continue  to  closely  monitor  ambulance  handovers  to 
ensure  that  performance  improves  over  the  coming  months,  and 
following  the 
implementation  of  the  new  standard  operating 
procedure.

Performance 
Cancelled  outpatient  appointments  continue  to  be  higher  than  the 
8%  threshold.  In  December  2017,  10.4%  of  appointments  were 
cancelled, reducing to 9.1% in January 2018.  
 
The percentage of patients without a binding date within 28 days of 
a cancelled operation is currently subject to validation. Following the 
implementation  of  Lorenzo  in  September  2017,  there  continues  to 
be work undertaken to ensure that the information is fully accurate 
and is linked to the development of revised Patient Treatment Lists. 
 
Actions 
ENHT  is  continuing  work  to  ensure  that  the  clinic  configuration  on 
the new system is correct. In addition, over the main winter period 
(December  2017  and  January  2018)  ENHT  cancelled  a  range  of 
planned  activity  in  accordance  with  national  guidance,  in  order  to 
support urgent care pathways.  
 
A  range  of  transformation  schemes,  including  reducing  follow  ups 
after  routine surgery, service  redesign to  reduce the need  for  face-
to-face  follow  ups,  and  straight  to  test  pathways,  continue  to  be 
discussed and developed between ENHT and the CCG, with the aim 
of optimising outpatient capacity.  
 
Recovery 
The  CCG  continues  to  work  closely  with  ENHT  to 
cancellations and waiting times for outpatient appointments.

Comments ׀  
Clostriidum difficile 
At the end of January 2018, ENHT had C diff rate per 100,000 occupied bed 
days below that of both the East of England and England as a whole. Of the 
cases  reported,  the  trust  has  successfully  appealed  9  cases  against 
contractual  sanctions  from  the  CCG.  No  lapses  that  contributed  to  these 
infections were identified by the CCG appeals panel. However, although not 
considered  to  have  contributed  to  the  infections,  a  number  of  areas  of 
learning for the trust were identified during these case reviews including:    
  
• No clear documentation regarding assessment of stool for sampling. 
•

IPC  team  need  to  look  at  trust  failed  discharge  data    in  terms  of 
implications for IPC. 

• Prevention of hospital acquired pneumonia and consequential antibiotic 

treatment should be considered in the prevention of CDI cases. 

• Gaps in stool chart completion. 
  
 
 

Progress  against  these  action  plans  is  being  monitored  by  the  Herts  IPC 
group.  These  issues  will  also  be  monitored  through  the  CCG  quality 
assurance visits. Any concerns over progress will be escalated to the QRM. 
 
MRSA Blood Stream Infection 
No  further  cases  of  MRSA  BSI  have  been  reported  since  November  2017. 
The  trust  has  been  assigned  one  case  to  date  this  year  and  their  rate  of 
infection remains below both regional and national rates. The trust MRSA 
policy  is  currently  being  updated  with  a  view  to  moving  to  universal 
admission  screening  for  MRSA  rather  than  a  risk  based  approach  to 
screening  as  at  present.  If  this  occurs,  this  should  address  the  issue  of 
omitted screening as identified in previous post infection reviews. 
 
E coli Blood Stream Infection 
The trust has reported a total of 29 cases of E coli BSI. Since last month the 
PHE  now  report  rates  of  E  coli  BSI  for  NHS  organisations  to  enable 
benchmarking. The ENHT rate of  17.03 per 100,000 occupied bed days is 
significantly below regional and national rates. 
 
Incidents 
None reported since November 2017.

Comments ׀  
Sickness absence 
In  December  the  in-month  sickness  absence  rate  increased  to  4.98% 
from 4.16% in November. Overall the annualised sickness absence rate 
has remained stable at 3.47%; this remains in line with the overall target 
of  reducing  the  annualised  absence  rate  down  to  3.3%  by  the  end  of 
March 2018. Actions taken to support improvement include the launch 
of a new sickness absence policy, early intervention by Health at Work 
in  respect  of  musculoskeletal  and  stress  related  sickness,  and  direct 
communications  with  individuals  reaching  informal  triggers  in  relation 
to their absence. 

 

Turnover 
During Q3 the Trust’s turnover rate increased to 13.39%. The Trust has 
developed  a  new  retention  plan  covering  four  key  areas;  improved 
experience  of  staffing  levels,  improved  clinical  management  and  team 
development,  enhanced  employment  offers  and  staff  benefits,  and 
improved career pathways. 

 

Vacancy rate 
There continues to be a number of vacancies at the Trust including ED 
and ward areas; the vacancy rate has remained stable in Q3 with a rate 
of  8.5%  in  December;  this  is  an  improvement  from  11.9%  at  the 
beginning  of  2017/18.  In  December  the  vacancy  rate  for  qualified 
nursing  was  8.26%,  and  for  unqualified  nursing  was  17.37%.  The 
vacancy  rate  for  band  5  nurses  was  reported  as  15.6%  at  the  end  of 
September;  this  has improved  to  11.8%  at  the  end of December.  Each 
Division  has  recruitment  plans  in  place,  with  bespoke  recruitment 
events planned throughout the year. Work is also being undertaken to 
enhance the branding of the Trust utilising digital media. 
 
Appraisal rate 
The  appraisal  rate  remains  below  the  Trust  target  of  90%  at  83.3%  at 
the  end  of  December,  although  this  does  show  some  improvement 
compared  to  Q2.  The  Trust  continues  to  prevent  automatic  pay 
progression for staff who have not received an appraisal.

Performance 
The  December  safer  staffing  data  shows  ENHT  to  have  adequate 
overall  fill  rate  for  qualified  staff  during  the  day  and  night; 
however the fill rate for non-qualified nursing staff during the day 
fell to 87.2% in December. A number of wards remain below 90% 
fill rate for qualified staff during the day. Over the last 12 months 
there  has  been  a  decrease  in  the  fill  rate  for  clinical  support 
workers and qualified nursing staff during the day; however the fill 
rate remains adequate. 
 
The  Trust  monitors  staffing  levels  on  a  daily  basis,  and  action  is 
taken to address any ward areas flagging red to ensure safe levels 
of staffing are in place. 
 
Whilst  there  has  been  a  decrease  in  nursing  fill  rates  throughout 
2017/18  there  is  currently  no  clear  correlation  between  staff 
levels  and  patient  harm.   However there  has  been an  increase  in 
care  related  complaints,  and  feedback  during  Quality  Assurance 
Visits has been mixed. 
 
Actions 
Safer staffing is reviewed during Quality Review Meetings as well 
as during Quality Assurance Visits. 
The  CCG  continues  to  monitor  vacancies  by  ward  on  a  monthly 
basis  to  review 
improvement  against  the  Trust’s  trajectory. 
Sickness  absence  and  bank  and  agency  usage  is  reviewed  at  the 
same time.

Comments ׀  
 
Mortality (SHMI) 
The December release of SHMI data (covering the rolling year to June 2017) showed that ENHT had maintained the previous improvements with a 
SHMI of 102.1. This is well below the upper control limit of 106.6. 
Following  the  publication  of  national  guidance  regarding  learning  from  deaths  progress  in  relation  to  the  key  requirements  continues  to  be 
monitored through the regular Mortality Review Group. 
 
Sepsis  
The  Trust  has  continued to perform well  in screening  and identifying  patients with  sepsis on  inpatient  wards  with  91% of  patients appropriately 
identified,  however  there  has  been  a  decrease  in  performance  compared  to  95%  in  Q2.  Additionally  the  Trust  has  deteriorated  in  relation  to 
identification of sepsis in ED with 86% of patients appropriately identified against a target of 90%. 
  
The timely treatment of patients with IV antibiotics has deteriorated in Q3 with 57% in ED  and  47% of inpatients  receiving  antibiotic  within one 
hour. Actions undertaken by the Trust to improve performance include; 
• Ongoing staff training and awareness sessions

This remains a key focus of discussions at both the Quality Review Meeting and Mortality Review Group. 
 
CQC Inspection 
The Trust is expecting a further CQC inspection in Spring 2018. Changes have been made to the Trust’s approach to quality improvement, with the 
CQC Development Board now looking to drive forward the wider quality improvement as well as support preparation for the CQC inspection. The 
Board has been renamed as the Quality Improvement Board. 
 
The  CCG  Quality  Managers  are  currently  actively  working  within  the  Trust  on  a  part  time  basis  for  a  period  of  eight  weeks  to  support  the 
preparation for the CQC inspection, and support quality improvement in the ward and clinical areas.

Comments  ׀   
 
Performance 
The  ED standard  remains challenging  for PAH,  with  figures  continuing 
to  decline  in  December.  Weekly  performance  reviews  with  NHSE  and 
NHSI continue with a focus on what ongoing support is required during 
winter. Over crowding in the department remains the main issue with 
ongoing  gaps  in  staffing,  high  attendances  and  lack  of  flow  also 
impacting performance.  
 
Actions  
• Continuing the refocus on ‘flow’ in the dept  – internal escalation 
      processes being briefed to all staff; 
• Refocus on Medical and Surgical assessment space utilisation; 
• CDU open but has limited capacity due to space sharing; 
• ENP  service  –  plan  to  move  it  to  an  urgent  care  space  which  will 

 

release CDU back to the ED; 

• Discharge Lounge – continue to identify early patients to pull from 

wards;

• 48 hour stay – focus on moving patients quickly from MAU through 
      Saunders Ward; 
• Review of current GP streaming service – proposal to relocate away 
      from  ED  and  progress  enhancement  of  new  front  desk  nurse                               
streaming (new Streaming SOP in first draft format); 
Consultant presence in RAT to lead and support early assessment. 
 
Recovery 
Areas for discussion at NHSE/I meetings include: 
• 7 day working and senior decision making in ED at weekends. 
• GP in ED during night time hours. 
• Medical input and additional doctors on the wards at weekends to 

support discharges.

Comments  ׀   
 
Performance 
Ambulance  handovers  at PAH  remain  below standard.  This  is  partly 
as  a  result  of  the  ED  re-configuration  work  resulting  in  limited 
ambulance assessment space.   
 
Arrival to handover delays for January were as follows: 
• Percentage within 15 minutes -  19% reduction of 3% compared 

to December. 

• Hours lost over 15 minutes – 403 increase of 34 hours compared 

to December. 

• Number  of  delays  over  30  minutes  was  548  and  there  was  106 

delays over 60 minutes.  

 
Actions 
EEAST have introduced a Patient Safety Intervention Team (PSIT) to 
target  hospitals  with  high  handover  delays.  The  weekly  PSIT  report 
for 29/01/18 reported that the impact of the PSIT teams had picked 
up  again  from  the  previous  week  with  an  18%  overall  reduction  in 
delays  across  the  consortium.  A  total  of  319  hrs  were  saved  this 
week bringing the total impact of PSIT to 3,016. This is the equivalent 
of 260 full DSA shifts. 
 
A  generic  Tripartite/Handover  Policy  is  being  agreed.  Following  the 
risk summit, a handover protocol has been put in place to which at 
30 minutes there is escalation to tactical and strategic level.  
 
Handover delays are a key focus of NHSE and NHSI.

Performance 
•  DTOC  improved  to  2%  against  3.5%  target  (2%  stretch  for  BCF 
achieved) 
• Integrated Discharge Team been in place since Dec 16 
•  Red  to  Green  implemented  across  the  Trust  on  all  wards  but 
discharges  at  weekends  low  and  towards  end  of  day  15%  before 
midday v 35% target and 60% before 5pm v 95% target 
•  Shift  assessments  for ongoing care once safe  to transfer  into the 
community  (ie.  CHC  assessments  86%  in  community  against  85% 
target) 
• Discharge to Assess model is being rolled out but requires shift in 
resource  into  the  community  to  support  complex  24  hour  care 
needs 

Performance 
•  Approximately  there  are  40  patients  a  day  in  acute  hospital  beds 
that are safe to transfer 
•  Trust  needs  to  discharge  an  average  of  70  patients  per  day, 
currently discharging circa 47. (Pathway 0: 58% 42 patients, Pathway 
1:  24%  17  patients,  Pathway  2:  14%  2  patients,  Pathway  3:  4%  3 
patients) 
• LOS stay currently 4.7 target 4 
 
Actions 
• A&E  Demand  Management  (Pre).  This  will  reduce  unnecessary 
unplanned  attendances  to  emergency  departments  and  ensure 
that  planned  attendances  are  managed  to  support  available 
capacity  within  Acute  Care  Pathways  (including  assessment 
pathways) 
 Improving Emergency Care Pathways (In). This will reduce waits 
and  improve  flow  through  emergency  departments  by  allowing 
staff  in  the  main  department  to  focus  on  patients  with  more 
complex conditions. 

•

• Maximising  bed  usage,  patient  flow  and  discharge  (Through). 
This  will  reduce  inpatient  bed  occupancy,  reduce  length  of  stay, 
and implementation of the ‘SAFER’ bundle will facilitate clinicians 
working collaboratively in the best interests of patients. 

• Managing demand, capacity and flow into the community (Out) 
All  systems  moving  to  a  ‘Discharge  to  Assess’  model  will  greatly 
reduce delays in discharging and points to home as the first port 
of call if clinically appropriate.  

• OD  and  Leadership.  This  will  create  the  right  environment  for 
system  wide  working  to  maximise  available  capacity  and 
resources to deliver high quality care.

Clostridium difficile 
Although  above  their  ceiling  for  C  diff  cases  to  date  in  2017/8,  the 
trusts rate of 8.79 infections per 100,000 occupied bed days remains 
significantly  below  both  regional and  national  rates. Of the  12  acute 
apportioned  cases  reported  to  the  end  of  January  2018,  5  of  these 
have  been  successfully  appealed  against  contractual  sanctions 
through West Essex CCG. 
 
MRSA Blood Stream Infection (BSI) 
No  cases  of  trust  assigned  MRSA  BSI  have  been  reported  to  date 
during 2017/18. 
 
E coli Blood Stream Infection (BSI) 
The  trust  has  reported  a  total  of  17  cases  of  E  coli  BSI.  Since  last 
month the PHE now report rates of E coli BSI for NHS organisations to 
enable benchmarking. The ENHT rate of 12.79 per 100,000 occupied 
bed days is significantly below regional and national rates. 
 
Incidents 
Since January 2018, PAH have reported a total of 6 ward outbreaks of 
norovirus. All wards were re-opened by the end of February 2018. A 
full outbreak report with lessons learnt is awaited from the trust.

Comments ׀  
Sickness 
At the end of December the Trust’s sickness absence rate was 3.85%, 
near  to  the  standard  of  3.5%.  The  trust  continues  to  do  some 
focussed on work on sickness absence management.  
 
Turnover 
Overall rolling annual Voluntary Turnover rate continues to decrease 
from  14.1%  to  13.8%  in  Dec  2017,  the  lowest  figure  in  the  last  12 
months which is the 6th successive month where turnover has been 
on the decline, although it remains above the target of 11%. 
 
Vacancy rate 
The  overall  Trust  vacancy  rate  for  Dec  2017  is  10.04%,  which  is  a  
drop from the October position of 9.45%. 
Registered vacancies for nursing Trust wide has increased by 0.49%. 
The  adult  inpatient  wards  continue  at  a  higher  level  of  vacancy,  to 
mitigate  some  of  the  risks  the  matrons  are  working  clinically  and 
staffing is reviewed on a shift by shift basis using bank.  
There  was  a  small  gain  of  0.39  WTE  registered  new  starters  in  the 
adult wards in month. 
The rolling 12 month position shows there is a net gain of 15.77 WTE 
registered nurses and midwives across the Trust. 
 
Appraisal rate 
The Trust compliance at the end of  October  for all staff was 86%; 
this  is  an  area  of  on-going  improvement.  Appraisal  rates  are 
scrutinised monthly by the NHSE/NHSI Oversight group.

Performance 
December  shows  an  overall  reduction  in  the  Trust  average  fill  rate 
for both registered & unregistered staff for day & night for the first 
time in 3 months. 
 
As  of  the  end  of  December,  The  Registered  Day  fill  rate  has 
decreased  by  8.8%;  with  the  unregistered  day  decreasing  by  6.9%. 
The night fill rate for registered staff also decreased by 6.2% with the 
unregistered  fill  rate  decreasing  by  5%  against  the  November 
position. 
 
Actions 
To  help  mitigate  the  risk,  there  is  a  three  times  daily  review  of 
patient acuity & dependency, staff are redeployed to optimise safety 
and meet the patients’ needs. 
 
The Health Group Matrons continue to work clinically to support the 
wards. 
 
Recruitment & retention actions continue. 
There was a net gain of 0.39 WTE nurse starters to the Safer Staffing

Comments ׀ 
Mortality rates  
The Dr Foster reported HSMR for October 2016 to September 2017 was 116.5 and statistically 'higher than expected' although lower than the 
previous period. This is the 10th consecutive month of reporting for a 'higher than expected' result.  
There is no significant difference between the weekday and weekend HSMR for emergency admissions. Both are ‘higher than expected’. 
The 12 month rolling crude death rate within the HSMR basket is 4.6% versus the EoE peer group rate of 3.7%. 
Morality rates and the trusts actions in relation to morality are scrutinised monthly by NHSE/NHSI as part of the oversight process. 
 
CQC Inspection 
Following the full inspection at the beginning of December, the Trust received a letter from the CQC outlining concerns/preliminary findings: 
•
• ED performance was poor. There were concerns around nursing documentation and recording care interventions.   
• Not all nurses who work in PACU (Post Anaesthetic Care Unit) are Paediatric or Paediatric Life Support trained or have safeguarding level 3.   
• Staffing on Dolphin ward (paediatrics) was a concern and specifically that the Matron is currently covering the ward sister’s maternity leave.   
• There was a concern that the trust were not using the full MCA for End of Life patients on the TEP (ceilings of care) form.  
• Concerns were raised by the CQC regarding an EOL patient they identified in ED. 
The final outcome report is awaited. 
 
Rheumatology Follow – ups: 
The trust undertook a review of clinical pathways in outpatients which identified a cohort of patients on the rheumatology pathway who have 
not  had  follow  up  reviews  by  the  service  since  their  first  appointment.  As  a  result  WECCG,  ENHCCG  and  PAH  agreed  a  review  of  the 
Rheumatology Pathway and Harms Reviews of all patients to be undertaken by 31st March. To date have resulted in no harm being found. The 
numbers on the outpatient backlog are decreasing each week and on-going monitoring and assurance is being provided by PAH on a weekly 
basis. Further specialties have subsequently been identified with backlogs and these are also being reviewed and progress is monitored weekly. 
(Cardiology; dermatology; gastroenterology; ophthalmology; rheumatology; trauma and orthopaedics; urology) 
  
Paediatric Orthopaedic and Ophthalmology Services 
The Paediatric orthopaedic and ophthalmology services are single handed service and had previously been flagged by PAH as a vulnerable. Due 
to demand into the services and issues with recruitment, both services are temporarily not accepting new referrals and are in the process of 
recruitment. A Paediatric Ophthalmology Consultant has now been appointed and will start in May. In the interim referrals will go to other local 
Trusts, the activity numbers into the services at PAH are small and therefore can be absorbed by other providers.

2 week wait 
Royal  Free  continues to  achieve  the  2  week wait  target,  achieving  93.6% overall  in  December  2017,  93.9%  at  Barnet  and  Chase  Farm,  and 
95.8% at Royal Free Hospital site. 
  
Cancer 31 day wait diagnosis to treatment- all cancer 
98.9% of patients attending the Royal Free were treated within 31 days of diagnosis during December 2017. All sites achieved this standard 
during the month. 
  
Cancer 62 Days from GP referral 
In December 2017, Royal Free achieved 89.5% against the 62 day Cancer standard. This represents sustained improvement in performance 
over recent months. Whilst Barnet and Chase Farm sites achieved 97.3% of patients being treated within 62 days of referral, performance was 
lower at Royal Free Hospital (80.4%). The tumour sites that achieved the standard were Breast, Haematology, Head & Neck, Lower GI, Lung,  
Skin and Upper GI.

Diagnostic 6 week wait 
In December 2017, Royal Free achieved 99.3%, which exceeded the 99% standard.  
•
• Breaches mainly affect the Royal Free Hospital site and are associated with capacity. 
• Echocardiography and cystoscopy continue to be reported as under-performing specialties.  
  
A&E 
• A&E performance increased to 86.1% in January 2018 for Royal Free as a whole, against the 95% standard. The Royal Free Hospital site 

achieved 84.2% and Barnet 83.2%.  

• At Barnet DTOCs remain high but daily multi agency meetings continue and work continues with Hertfordshire CCGs to reduce DTOC 

volumes. 

• Royal Free Hospital has seen continued improvement in minors and streaming performance. This has been supported by an additional GP 

session between 10am -2pm for patients in the urgent care centre.  
 

RTT incomplete. 
• Combined trust  reporting shows 83% of patients were treated within 18 weeks against a target of 92%. 
• Submission of the January position was delayed by two days due to issues related to a PAS upgrade, resulting in delays and data quality 

•

errors; the submitted position is therefore lower than expected. 
 A recovery plan and trajectory has been developed and shared with commissioners and NHS Improvement, with expected recovery of RTT 
performance by August 2018. 
 

52 week waits 
• Trust wide 52 week wait breaches total 34 as at the end of January 2018 which is a reduction from the previous month of 47 breaches. The 
trust plan to reduce breaches further and aim to achieve zero breaches by February 2018. None of the 52 week wait breaches identified for 
January relate to ENHCCG patients. 

• The Trust have advised that all breaches continue to have a full harm review completed.

 C. difficile and MRSA blood stream infections 
the Trust has reported a total of 47 cases of C. diff against a ceiling of 66. Three of those cases have been confirmed to have occurred due to 
lapses  in  care,  2  relate  to  antibiotic  usage  and  one  due  to  transmission  on  a  ward  at  the  main  Hampstead  site.  A  total  of  13  cases  were 
reported at Barnet Hospital or Chase Farm Hospital. A multi-disciplinary panel, including CCG and RFL representation, have reviewed the RCA 
and have identified that there were no lapses in care that contributed to these 13 infections.  
Two cases of MRSA have been reported by the RF YTD; neither of the cases occurred at the BCFH sites. 
 
Never Events 
At the end of Q3 five Never Events have been reported by the Trust since 1st April 2017, none of which related to Hertfordshire residents. The 
Never Event themes relate to: 
• Wrong stent insertion in endoscopy 
• Wrong dose of insulin administered 
• Wrong side chest drain insertion 
• Wrong site surgery 
• Retained swabs 
ENHCCG has sought assurance from HVCCG regarding the learning from SIs and Never Events. 
 
Workforce  
The overall Trust vacancy rate has continued to increase slightly with a rate of 13.5% in December. The turnover rate for RF has also increased 
slightly with a rate of 15.98% in December compared to 15.5% in September. At the Barnet site the vacancy rate remains below the threshold 
of 11%, however the Chase Farm vacancy rate remains high at 17.24% in December. The Trust continues to hold monthly open days and 2 
assessment centres a month to ensure on-going recruitment.  
 
Maternity services 
The current maternity dashboard shows an increase in overall c-section rates throughout 2017/18 at the Barnet site, with a rate of 32.5% in 
October. Following a peak in the rate of emergency sections in August, the rate in October had decreased slightly to 19.3%. The elective rate in 
October was 13.2%. 
In the recently published CQC maternity patient experience survey results the RF was found to be ‘the same as most Trusts’ for the majority of 
questions. Overall the Trust did show an improvement in the majority of questions compared to the 2015 survey results.

Performance 
Whilst DToCs had fallen to their lowest levels this financial year in October, they rose again in November. The health delays have fallen slightly 
for December to 12.3% and HCT have noted that the number of health delays has reduced for February.  
 
Actions 
HCT  continue  to  embed  Red2Green  and  undertake  daily  and  weekly  internal  and  system-wide  calls  to  support  discharges.  HCT  have  also 
worked proactively with system wide partners to establish the Discharge Home to Assess (DH2A) service to further support discharges out of

Performance 
HCT is still not meeting the target of 90% of patients achieving their 
estimated  date  of  discharge.  In  December,  52%  of  patients  were 
discharged  on  the  date  estimated.  This 
is  a  reduction  from 
November when 63% of patients were discharged on their estimated 
date of discharge.  
 
Actions 
The  percentage  of  patients  meeting  the  Estimated  Discharge  Date 
(EDD)  has been around 50% all year. The trust has worked internally 
to re-write a professional standard for staff to adhere to (similar to 
the work that was undertaken for DToCS and R2G). Under this new 
method,  patients  will  now  have  a more accurate  EDD set  within  72 
hours.

Implementation  of  the  Trust  Resourcing  Plan  continues  with 
renewed  pace  following  the  recent  re-organisations.  An  RCN  half-
page advert came out on 10th January and a campaign to advertise 
on targeted petrol pumps is starting shortly. 
 
The  Trust  has  also  continued  to  increase  its  social  media  presence, 
with the planned live Facebook feed now taking place in February. 
 
Two  career  clinics  have  been  set  up  for  the  Watford  area  for

Comments ׀  
 
Whilst all units had staffing levels above the HCT target, Herts and Essex continue to have vacant Registered Nurse posts 3.22 WTE, which along with 
the escalation of four beds in December, contributed to low staffing levels. The use of ‘Long line’ agency staff continues until vacancies are filled, and 
additional Healthcare Assistants are used on day shifts. Targeted work to improve recruitment and retention of staff to Herts and Essex is in place.

The  demand  for  PALMS  is  outside  the  commissioned  capacity  for  the  service  which  has  increased  access  waiting  times  to  the  first 
appointment. PALMS is commissioned to actively work with 600 CYP per year, however, PALMS are working with over 800 CYP per year. The 
estimate for the whole of 2017-18 is 862 CYPs. The current baseline for the wait from referral to initial contact is 27 weeks. There are 36 
people who have waited longer than 18 weeks for assessment in E&N Herts.  
 
Triage  is  undertaken  within  one  week,  this  target  is  consistently  achieved  at  100%.  Priority  assessments  are  undertaken  within  5  working 
days,  this  target  is  consistently  achieved  at  100%.  The  access  waiting  times  for  'weeks  for  treatment  to  commence'  was  27  weeks  in 
November 2017. If referrals continue at the current rate, we would expect the waiting list to rise from the current 180 in January 2018 to 334 
by January 2019.

Recovery 
Commissioners tasked PALMS to create a remedial action plan to reduce waiting times to access the service and are monitoring this closely. 
The remedial action plan is to achieve a reduction in overall waiting times within the current service. Commissioners have been working with 
PALMS to increase capacity through additional funding but the service has been unable to recruit sufficient additional staff. 
 
It includes the following actions: 
 
LOS 12 MONTH REVIEW: At Initial Assessment, PALMS to agree appropriate goals with the family and timeframe to achieving these goals. 
Families  to  be  discharged  once  goals  are  achieved.  PALMS  use  parent  contact  with  each  family  as  ratified  by  the  parent  /  carer  forum 
(established by Commissioners) to promote collaborative working with the family from the beginning of intervention and to be clear that the 
identified goals are to be the focus of work.  
 
REVIEW OF LONG STAY CYP: Current review of discharged CYP with a length in service of more than 1 year being undertaken to review and 
standardise on best practice, which will be applied to current caseload. In parallel with this a review on CYP on the caseload for 2 years or 
more being undertaken to identify families for discharge or referral on to another service for longer term support. Effect on IAA waiting list 
will be quantified once the review has been undertaken.  
 
JOINT VISITS: The number of joint visits, 2 clinicians being present for one consultation is being reviewed with a view to standardising and 
developing tight guidelines. This currently happens with 13% of clinical contacts, the service is aiming to reduce this to 11%. This will free up 
some capacity, the extent of which will be confirmed after the review. 
 
FEEDING GROUPS: Pilot of one group w/c 19/04/18. Plan to deliver up to 3 additional groups per term with up to 6 CYP families in each group 
dependent on referrals numbers. 
 
SLEEPING GROUPS: Pilot of one group w/c 19/02/18. Plan to deliver up to 3 additional groups per term with up to 8  CYP  families  in  each 
group. 
 
REMOTE VIDEO CONSULTATIONS: PALMS have sourced a GoTo Meeting license that will be used for secure video consultations for suitable 
families. A review is currently being undertaken to gauge the number of suitable families and the types of consultations this will be suitable 
for. There will be savings in travelling time, will increase access for families and will reduce DNAs.

Skin Health Service 
 
HCT have informed the CCG of 3 incidents within the Skin Health Service. CCG colleagues from Quality, Commissioning and Contracts have 
met with HCT to understand the incidents, any learning and next steps. This will be closely monitored through Contract Review Meetings.  
 
HCAI 
Clostridium difficile (CDI) 
By the end of January, HCT had reported 7 cases of C. diff against a ceiling of 5 cases for this point in the year. So far 4 have these have been 
successfully appealed against contractual sanctions as there were deemed to have been no lapses in care that contributed to these 
infections. However the case reviews undertaken by the CCG multidisciplinary appeals panel did identify a number of areas where best 
practice had not been followed and where lessons needed to be learnt by the trust. These issues included: 
  

• Patient received laxatives whilst on treatment for CDI 
•
•
• Poor timeliness of prescription of CDI treatment 

Lack of understanding regarding prioritisation of side room use 
Lack of involvement of a system wide approach to case review 

  
MRSA Blood Stream Infection (BSI) 
No cases of MRSA BSI have been reported during 2017/18. However HCT were involved in the post infection review of a CCG case during 
January 2018. The review highlighted several areas of learning for HCT. These included the fact that HCT needed to further investigate the 
prescription by non-medical prescriber, and if necessary consider additional training. Feedback is awaited in terms of progress with this 
action.

The  Trust  continues  to  review  the  cardiac  arrest  data  closely  to 
better  understand  any  clinical  practice  that  may  affect  these 
fluctuations  and  replicate  best  practice  where  possible.  Work  is 
ongoing with the air ambulance charities to provide evidence of best 
practice  in  order  to  emulate  successes  where  practicable.  Further 
consultation  on  the  cardiac  strategy  was  sought  at  the  two-day 
clinical briefing in October from staff and stakeholders.

Comments ׀  
 
PPCI 
The Trust has seen a very slight decrease in compliance against this 
AQI. This emphasises that the timeliness of our clinicians recognising 
a  STEMI  and  transporting  the  patient  to  a  PPCI  centre  is  pivotal  in 
reducing the potential damage to heart muscle and prevents further 
clinical deterioration.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stroke 
Work is being continued to support the recognition of strokes and to 
encourage patients to call if they have the symptoms highlighted in 
the successful national FAST campaign. Transportable resources are 
the key to providing a timely delivery to the HASU for these patients 
and it is likely that the Trust's capacity gap is having an impact on this 
target.  However,  some  symptoms  are  very  difficult  to  detect  when 
the  patient  makes  their  initial  999  call.  Equally,  the  ACLs  are 
reviewing the calls where the target was not achieved to understand 
the  on  scene  times  to  see  if  any  difference  can  be  made  to  the 
overall  time  to  HASU.  Feedback  is  provided  at  Quarterly  Quality 
Review meetings and Sector meetings.

Performance 
Performance  for  C1  and  2  response  calls  remains  below  the 
standard.  However,  from  December  to  January  there  has  been  a 
slight improvement in both C1 and C2 responses. Following the risk 
summit  a  number  of  actions  have  been  put  in  place  to  maximise 
UHP. High vacancy levels have impacted on response times and is 
being addressed as part of EEAST’s commitment to recruiting more 
paramedics  which  includes  exploring  options  offering  staff  a  £2k 
package  to  move  from  over  established  areas  to  those  that  have 
significant vacancies. The vacancy rate for end of January was still 
high  at  16%  for  ENHCCG  and  10%  across  the  BHL  Locality.  It  was 
reported at the EEAST sector meeting 30 student paramedic will be 
put  into  posts  in  ENHCCG  area  and  therefore  will  reduce  the 
vacancies  significantly  however  the  off  set  of  this  is  that  it  is 
expected that the final Independent service report will indicate an 
increase in staff and vehicles and therefore vacancies will increase. 
 
For  December  there  was  2,441  conveyances  to  Lister  an  increase 
of 6% compared to November.  December reported an increase of 
107 ambulance calls in relation to breathing problems compared to 
November.

Actions 
In  order  to  support  delivery  of  an  efficient  ambulance  service  delivering  national  performance  standards,  which  reflects  the  ambitions 
across urgent care, NHS England, NHS Improvement, commissioners and EEAST have agreed, as part of a binding mediation outcome that a 
jointly commissioned strategic service review is required. It will assess and make practical and implementable recommendations as to the 
future  resourcing  required  for  EEAST  in  relation  to  supporting  delivery  of  the  Sustainability  and  Transformation  Plan  (STP)  ambitions, 
constitutional  performance  standards  and  contractual  key  performance  indicators,  which  are  subject  to  fines  and  performance 
management. The work has been commissioned by NHS England and NHS Improvement, with input from EEAST and commissioners who 
will be joint recipients of the draft and final reports. Commissioners are still awaiting sight of the final report. 
 
Performance is also discussed at the monthly EEAST sector meeting and monthly SLA meeting. CCG’s are also invited to EEAST Operational  
Performance  Improvement  and  Delivery  Group  meetings  which  are  held  fortnightly  and  information  is  provided  regarding  weekly 
performance. 
 
Recovery 
Hear and Treat performance is currently delivering 9.2% in January against a target of 9.5%.  
Private ambulance services are currently being utilised to help with demand.

Performance 
Week ending 11/02/18 
• ENHT  performance  for  ambulance  handovers  to  clear  within  15 

minutes handover to clear achievement was 66.5%.  

• There  were  7  delays  over  30  minutes  and  0  delays  over  60 

minutes.   

• With  regard  to  PAH,  performance  for  ambulance  handovers    to 

clear within 15 minutes achieved 49.1%.   

• There  were  19  delays  over  30  minutes  and  0  delays  over  60 

minutes. 

 
ENHCCG  continues  to  commission  HALOs  working  between  10am  – 
10pm, 7 days a week to facilitate the physical and clinical handover 
of patients. 
EEAST have introduced a Patient Safety Intervention Team (PSIT) to 
target  hospital  with  high  handover  delays.  The  weekly  PSIT  report 
29/01/18 reported the that the impact of the PSIT teams had picked 
up  again  from  the  previous  week  with  an  18%  overall  reduction  in 
delays across the consortium. 319 hrs were saved this week bringing 
the total impact of PSIT to 3016. This is the equivalent of 260 full DSA 
shifts. 
A generic Tripartite/Handover Policy is being agreed. 
 
Actions 
Over the last 12 months, ENHT has revised the ambulance handover 
pathway,  including  the  administrative  processes.  As  a  result,  ENHT 
have  now  significantly  improved  hours  lost  over  the  15  minute 
handover time. 
PAH  has  recruited  agency  paramedics  to  support  the  queues  in  ED 
and  a  Standard  Operating  Procedure  has  been  implemented  to 
support the management of the ambulance queue.

As a result of concerns raised about the timeliness of ambulance response times during the end of December 2017 and early January 2018 a 
risk summit has taken place. 
 
The Trust undertook a review of cases where significant delays had occurred during this period (47 cases) 22 of those individual cases were 
raised as Serious Incidents across The East od England. 
 
A process was put in place to review the 22 cases and all locality CCG leads attend a weekly panel to scrutinise the cases. ENHCCG is the 
locality lead for Beds, Herts and Luton and has 2 cases attributed to those CCGs out of the 22 cases. 
  
A  Harm  review  process  has  been  undertaken.  Led  by  an  independent  ED  consultant  which  ENHCCG  participated  in  to  ascertain  levels of 
harm in each of the 22 cases.

Performance 
December  performance  increased  by  over  5%  in  comparison  to 
November  performance  and  achieved  the  98%  target.  Referral 
numbers continue to increase with 111 referrals through December.  
 
Actions 
Ongoing  work  is  progressing  with  SPA  to  reduce  the  pass  on  rates  of 
individual clinical assessors. The implementation of a DNA protocol and 
work  with  GPs  will  assist  in  improving  the  clinical  decision  making 
regarding those individuals who do not engage with HPFT services for 
an initial assessment and this will also impact on improving the capacity 
within HPFT teams to see individuals in a timely way.  
 
Recovery 
This new way of working is scheduled to begin from February 2018.  
 
 
 
Performance 
One stop clincs have been increased to include the East of the County. 
It takes longer to see patients in a one-stop-shop which has impacted 
on <6 week waits, but has reduced the time to diagnosis from 13 weeks

actions to improve and sustain the position for those who are overdue 
or require CPA review, Risk Assessment and Cluster review. The clinical 
director who is currently reviewing medical caseloads and in particular

Recovery 
HPFT  teams  are  expected  to  meet  and  sustain  95%  target  by  mid-
month February. 
 
Performance 
Progress continues to be made in December. There has been a marked 
improvement  in  the  recording  of  accommodation  statuses.  Progress 
has  slowed  as  the  people  who  still  need  to  have  this  completed  are 
those  with  less  complex  needs,  who  are  seen  less  frequently  and  are 
also more likely to be in settled accommodation.

Performance  
Sickness absence rate in Q3 has increased from 4.3% in Q2 to 4.7% 
 
Actions  
Focused work to manage sickness absence with the HR Business Partners and 
Employee Relations Team working with managers and new sickness absence 
boards.    Health  and  wellbeing  initiatives  have  taken  place  during  Q3  and 
51.5% of frontline staff have had their free flu vaccine to date during the flu 
campaign.    Work  to  be  undertaken  with  occupational  health  and  the  OD 
team  to  support  some  hotspot  areas.    A  mindfulness  practitioner  is  being 
recruited to support the health and wellbeing activity. 
 
Recovery 
This  target  is  affected  seasonally  and  should  see  improvement  with  the 
actions being taken by HPFT in Q4 2018. 
Performance 
Staff with a current PDP has decreased from 89% in Q2 to 87% in Q3.  
 
Actions 
There  is  a  focus  at  team  performance  meetings  and  core  management 
meetings  to  keep  the  momentum  to  reaching  compliance.  The  Managing 
Director has written to the managers in the poor performing areas to request 
that all outstanding PDPs are completed by the end of January.   
 
Recovery 
Improvement with actions in place should be seen in Q4 2018.

Performance 
The  Trust  continues  to  have  some  challenges  with  recruitment  with 
24.9% RN vacancies and HCAs at 19.4%. 
 
Actions 
The  Trust  and  the  University  of  Hertfordshire  are  involved  in  the 
Health  Education  England  pilot  to  undertake  a  2  year  Master 
programme for mental health nursing. Of the 10 in the cohort which 
stated in September, 4 were seconded HCAs from the Trust.  
The  Trust  continues  to  work  with  the  local  universities  ensuring  that 
student  nurses  feel  part  of  the  Trust  family  at  the  start  of  their 
training and meeting senior nurse leaders during their training 
 
Recovery 
There are  17 newly registered nurses (Cohort September 2014), who 
have started in their respective services and are undergoing their 
preceptorship.

Quality Impact Assessment (QIA) undertaken against the Trusts cash releasing efficiency schemes (CRES) 
 
The Trust’s approach to CRES is to identify opportunities for quality improvement and innovation. To support this, a Director of Innovation and 
Transformation  has  been  appointed.  This  will  sit  alongside  the  work  that  is  already  in  place  to  ensure  that  our  approach  to  improving  the 
productivity and effectiveness of our services is under pinned by a commitment to delivering safe and effective service developments. 
 
CQC  
 
HPFT were visited by CQC from 23rd January to 9th February 2018. Areas seen were Adult services, CAMHS inpatient services, LD services, Forensic 
inpatient services. They focused on inpatient provision and discussed matter surrounding: environment, mixed assessment on quality of buildings.  
Also emphasis on the topic of seclusion, ligature assessments.  
CQC  feedback  was    how  much  they  were  impressed  by  HPFT’s  staff.  Strong,  very  compassionate  and  caring  towards  their  patients  and  service 
users. 
 
There were ‘No must do’s.’ 
 
Full feedback will be in late March 2018.

Rota  fill  at  weekends  ranged  from  77%  to  82%  which  impacted  on 
performance.  Where  there  was  a  shortage  in  rota  fill,  visiting  GPs 
base cover is prioritised, which delays appointments and impacts on 
the home visiting targets. 
Actions 
A  reminder  has  been  sent  to  receptionists  and  central  booker’s 
regarding the time frames in which urgent and routine appointment 
should  be  booked  within.  Patients  were  offered  alternative  bases 
where there is capacity to support reductions in waiting times.  
 
As  with  the  home  visiting  performance  the  CCG  has  started 
fortnightly  meetings  with  HUC  to  undergo  a  deep  dive  into  the 
service to further understand where the constraints are and amend 
current  action  plans  to  improve  performance.  Flu  outbreaks  have 
also  impacted  on  performance  especially  over  the  weekends  and 
throughout  December  and  January,  with  a  high  number  of  patients 
requiring assessment and treatment within care homes.

Performance 
In January, the CAS received 3,879 cases and the rota fill was 98%. 
 
As  the  service  is  completely  new,  the  CCG  acknowledges  that  the 
initial  standards  that  were  set  locally  were  going  to  challenge  the 
service, and there was a  risk that they would not be achieved.  
 
Both  the  15  minute  and  warm  transfer  standards  are  not  being 
achieved. The time is measured from the initial call to pathways. The 
pathway  part of  the call  takes  an average of  8 minutes  before  the 
CAS disposition is reached, this allows the CAS clinician 7 minutes to 
call the patient back.  
Actions 
A review of the standards has been undertaken with the IUC clinical 
leads and an amendment to the metric has been agreed to start the 
clock  once  the  disposition  on  the  CDSS  (NHS  Pathways)  has  been 
reached. 
 
The 15 minute call back targets are continually monitored and cases 
are assessed according to clinical priority and managed by the Senior 
CAS Clinician. 
 
A  review  of  the  current  local  performance  standards  has  been 
completed  and  is  currently  being  reviewed  by  both  ENHCCG  and 
HVCCG as part of changes to the contract for 2018-19. This will see 
more  appropriate  operational  standards  for  the  service  being 
implemented. 
 
Recovery  
Update local performance targets to be in place for 2018-19.

Daily team meetings are carried out with the resource team to address any rota gaps, with the focus on ensuring full cover 
of the Tier 1 bases moving GPs from other bases if required.  

Rota fill has had a slight decrease in Tier 1 bases due to the additional winter pressure shifts and a higher level of GP 
sickness, cancelled shifts and lateness.

Performance 
Just over 20% of pharmacist shifts (14) were not covered in January. 
 
The  CAS  GP’s  pick  up  any  pharmacy  calls  when  there  is  no 
pharmacist available. 
 
The  CCG  will  continue  to  monitor  this  through  the  Quality  and 
Contract review meetings and work with HUC to ensure all avenues 
are being explored to address the gaps within the pharmacy rota fill.

The Pathology Partnership (TPP) 

Comments  ׀   
 
During  Q3,  3  enquiries  were  received  via  the  GP  hotline  relating  to  pathology  services,  this  is  a  significant  reduction  compared  to  the  12 
enquiries received in Q2 and continues the downward trend in the number of enquiries received each quarter since Q4 2015/16.  
 
Reported queries related to a delay in communicating test results, cancelled tests and the recall process, and clarification regarding reference 
ranges. 
 
Following the organisational change of pathology services on 5th May 2017, the CCG continues to work closely with the providers and host 
commissioner to monitor the quality of services and ensure practices are kept well informed of any changes.

Continuing Healthcare Policy Update 

The  CCG  is  currently  reviewing  its  Continuing  Health  Care  (CHC)  Policy  to  reflect  the 
national changes to the CHC framework and NHS Funded Nursing Care, which centre on 
ensuring that funding decisions are person centred, maximise personalisation and individual 
control  where  practical.    This  is  expected  to take  a  number  of  months,  and  in  the  interim 
therefore some minor amendments are being made to the policy to reflect the following: 

 

 

 

the  process  undertaken  by  the  decision  maker  to  ensure  equity  is  exercised 
throughout the decision making process, 
that  the  decision  making  takes  account  of  the  circumstances  of  the  individual, 
including where expressed the right to live independently and 
that a value for money assessment has been made 

We expect these amendments to have been made by the end of April.  It is expected that a 
full revision of the policy will have been completed by October 2018. 

2.3 

Nascot Lawn Judicial Review Update

Nascot  Lawn  has  been  providing  a  respite  care  service  for  children  with  complex  health 
needs and their parents since at least 1986.  Following a two day hearing in February 2018, 
in the High Court of Justice, the Judge set the decision aside to withdraw funding, to allow a 
collaborative dialogue to proceed.  On 21 March 2018, Hertfordshire County Council will be 
holding  a  special  health  scrutiny  meeting  for  the  Committee's  scrutiny  of  Herts  Valleys 
Clinical  Commissioning  Group's  proposal  to  withdraw  £600,000  funding  from  the  Nascot 
Lawn NHS Respite Centre.

‘Future Heroes’ Health and Social Care Careers event 

Around 600 secondary school students attended the ‘Future Heroes’ Health and Social Care 
Careers event at the Fielder Centre in Hatfield.  The interactive event on 7 March enabled 
students to meet over 70 professionals and take part in hands-on activities, getting a first-
hand insight into the huge range of career opportunities on offer in our STP area.  See the 
Future Heroes site for more information: https://futureheroes.org.uk/

Delegation Agreement 

On 12th January 2018, myself and the Lay Member for Governance and Audit received a 
letter from NHS England - Paul Baumann, Chief Finance Officer, confirming NHS England 
approval for the CCG to take on delegated commissioning arrangements for primary medical 
services on 1st April 2018.  In 2014/15, NHS England agreed with CCGs and NHS Clinical 
Commissioners a standardised set of primary functions for delegated agreements, as set out 
in the Delegation and Delegation Agreement.  These are two separate documents, and the 
Delegation  document  sets  out  the  statutory  delegation  of  primary  care  commissioning 
functions to  the  CCG.   NHS  England  will  issue  a  signed  copy  of the  Delegation  once the 
Delegation Agreement has been signed by both parties.  CCGs are not required to sign the 
Delegation.  The Delegation is supplemented by the Delegation Agreement, which sets out 
the detailed arrangements for how the CCG will exercise its delegated functions. 

The CCG has also updated its Constitution to allow these changes to take place, and this is 
currently being finalised with NHS England.

Risk Profile Update 

The  Strategic  Risk  Register  (SRR)  and  Risk  Controls  and  Assurance  Dashboard  (RCAD) 
were reviewed across the CCG during quarter 4 2017-18.  Proposals were agreed regarding 
the addition of new risks and closure of mitigated risks at the Executive Team Meeting on 06 
March 2018 and reported to the Governance and Audit Committee on 14 March 2018. 

2.5.1  Strategic Risk Register 

The SRR contains risks that, if they materialised, could detrimentally impair the CCG’s ability 
to successfully achieve its Strategic Objectives and is refreshed regularly to reflect changing 
circumstances.    The  risks  detailed  in  the  RCAD  are  mapped  to  the  Strategic  Risks  and 
attached as Appendix 1. 

2.5.2  Risks, Controls and Assurance Dashboard  

The  RCAD  enables  the  CCG  to  have  an  understanding  of  its  risk  profile  and  the 
effectiveness of controls to mitigate the risks.  The Primary Risks (Red scoring 16+) have 
been included in Appendix 2.  The full version of the RCAD is available to Governing Body 
members on request. 

Key findings identified from this review since the last update provided in November 2017:- 
  10 risks have been mitigated to a lower risk rating (ID 1.32, 1.50, 3.4, 4.1, 5.3, 5.4, 

5.8, 5.12, 5.25 and 5.30) 

  15 risks remain at the same risk rating (ID 1.26, 1.33, 1.57, 4.15, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10, 5.16, 

5.22, 5.24, 5.28, 5.31, 5.33, 5.35 and 5.36) 

  2 risks have seen an increase of risk rating (ID 1.54 and 5.34) 
  9 risks have been mitigated and closed (ID 1.10, 1.22, 1.46, 2.8, 4.16, 5.13, 5.26, 

5.29 and 5.32) 

  3 new risks have been identified and added (5.37, 5.38 and 5.39) 

There are now 30 risks on the RCAD in the following categories: 

Red

2.5.3  Closed Risks 

In addition, and in accordance with the annual review of closed risks, the Executive Team 
reviewed the Closed Risk Register and confirmed that none of the previously closed risks 
require re-opening. 

The Governing Body is asked to note and discuss the updated Strategic Risk Register and 
Risk Controls Assurance Dashboard, including actions agreed by the Executive Team. 

2.6 

Register of Interests / Register of Gifts and Hospitality 

The CCG has recently undertaken a proactive exercise to update its Register of Interests.  
Interests  have  been  recorded  for  Governing  Body  members,  Band  8a  staff  members  and 
above,  Band  7  where  appropriate,  and  the  57  member  Practice  Representatives.    The 
registers (Appendix 3 and 4) were scrutinised by the Governance and Audit Committee on 
14 March 2018. 

The Governing Body is asked to receive the Register of Interests and Register of Gifts and 
Hospitality reported in 2017-18. 

2.7  Managing Conflicts of Interest Online Training for CCGs 

The new Mandatory Managing Conflicts of Interest Online training has been issued by NHS 
England.  This will be rolled out at the required level of Module 1 to all band 8a and above 
staff including the Governing Body members.  HR will consider rolling out Module 2 and 3, 
as optional training to other members of staff at a future date once the initial target audience 
of band 8a and above have completed the course and achieved a compliant status.  The 
deadline for completion will be 30th April 2018.  The Head of Organisational Development 
and  Learning,  Delphine  Garr  has  undertaken  an  exercise  to  self-enrol  Governing  Body 
members and can be contacted via Delphine.Garr@hertsvalleysccg.nhs.uk for any queries. 

The Governing Body is asked to complete the new piece of mandatory training by 30 April 
2018. 

2.8

Strategic Risk 6: 
Financial Sustainability of Providers in the Health Economy - Department of Health's departmental expenditure limit could be breached unless acute trust deficits (nationally and locally) are reduced. Deficit reduction might be attempted by driving down costs and staffing, which 
could impact on performance and/or the quality of services; or by increasing national prices and/or top slicing CCG funds, leading to cost pressures for CCGs nationally and ENHCCG too. In response ENHCCG would have to restrict investment and/or reduce services to achieve its 
financial plan.

Progress Update

Concerns continue - new Director of Nursing and Medical Director 
are now in pot but we are yet to see outcomes being delivered.
25-Oct-17- There continues to be a period of turnover within the 
management team at the Trust, CCG monitoring. The new Director of 
Nursing will be in post from January 2018 and there are also a number 
of new interims in post for Cancer.
18-Aug-17 - Risk re-defined. CCG monitoring quality improvement and 
CIP monitored via the trust QRM
26-Jul-17 - Formal letters sent from CEO regarding Lorenzo and 
Cancer, raised Lorenzo risk and lack of capacity with NHSI.
02-Feb-17 - Still awaiting further CQC inspection. Ongoing programme 
at QAV including themed visits reviewing progress against issues 
identified by CQC.
30-Sept-16 - The Constitutional targets component of this risk is being 
separated out into a separate risk. Await further CQC inspection. Latest 
report relating to ED + children's services acknowledges progress but 
further improvement required.  

06-Feb-18:
NEW RISK AGREED AT EXECUTIVE MEETING
02-Feb-18 - Proposed to Executive Team for approval at their meeting 
on 06-Feb-18
28-Jan-18 - Letter drafted to be sent by NHSE asking for dates for an 
urgent meeting to review the issues at Sollershott.

Risk

If East and North Herts NHS 
Trust fail to address the quality 
and governance issues, due to 
the increased turnover within 
the 'middle management tier' 
and financial pressures across 
the trust, then there is a risk that 
the delivery of the CIP and to 
quality of care will be 
compromised which may 
potentially result in patient 
harm.

5.39 There is a risk that patient care 

will be compromised at 
Sollershott GP practice 
(Letchworth) if engagement with 
the contract holder  (TPG) 
doesn't improve which could 
result in deficiencies in care 
going undetected and CQC 
recommendations not being 
met.

Strategic Objectives:

Strategic Risks:

SO1: To commission safe and appropriate healthcare services.

SR1: Failure of the CCG to ensure delivery of safe, high quality and effectives services from appropriately commissioned providers.

SO2: To commission effective services that enhances the well-
being of our residents within the available resources.

SO3: To engender a culture of engagement in the decision 
making processes amongst partners and stakeholders to ensure 
ownership of service priorities.

SO4: To build an organisation with the capacity and capability to 
deliver agreed service priorities.

SR2: Failure to establish an adequate and appropriate commissioning plan that is informed by member practices.

SR3: If we fail to fulfil our responsibility to proactively engage with other STP stakeholders and to influence STP appropriately there is a risk 
that we will not deliver a sustainable local health and social care system potentially resulting in judicial review, financial failure and detrimental 
effects on patients.

SR4: Failure of the CCG to manage the financial budget and meet its financial target.

SR5: Failure to implement key work streams to ensure delivery of the CCG’s strategic plan.

SR6: Financial Sustainability of Providers in the Health Economy 

SR7: As a result of a shortage of appropriately skilled staff there is a risk that the CCG will not be able to effectively commission new services 
or provide existing services which could result in diminished services and poor outcomes for patients and failure to deliver core services.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

The CCG is on line to achieve its planned surplus control total of £14.498m set out in its Financial 
Plan approved by the Governing Body and NHS England. This control total is the surplus brought 
forward  from  the  previous  year  less  £200k  that  the  CCG  has  been  allowed  to  spend  of  this  in 
2017/18. 

The CCG’s financial position as at Month 10 is an in-year surplus of £82k which is in addition to the 
cumulative brought forward control total mentioned above.  

Running costs for the CCG reported a YTD underspend of £707k and forecast to underspend by 
£745k on the budget set. The budget set is £1.2m lower than the running cost allocation received 
with this sum having been effectively transferred internally to fund healthcare services. 

The  QIPP  position  is  the  forecast  delivery  of  £22.19m  against  a  plan  of  £23.2m  resulting  in  an 
under delivery of £1.04m – which equates to a delivery yield of 96% for the full year.  

The CCG is also delivering the targeted BPPC performance. The target is to pay at least 95% of 
invoices within 30 days. Actual performance YTD is 99.5% for NHS and 99.1% for Non NHS. 

The CCG is currently managing potential financial risks of £1.15m which may impact the delivery 
of the CCG’s target financial position if crystallised; however these risks are currently mitigated by 
contingency held by the CCG.

Comment

Our allocation movement this month is a 
reduction of £157k

The CCG is on track and is forecast to deliver the 
control total agreed with NHSE

The running cost budget is forecast to underspend 
by £745k. The remainder of the underspend of 
£1.211m was transferred to fund programme 
budget

The CCG is currently forecasting to deliver 96% of 
the annual QIPP plan. 

No contingency reserve has been used to date, 
however, in order to deliver our required position 
at the year end we have brought in £1.9m 
underspend into the forecast

3.

4.1  Locality Financial Performance 

The  locality  positions  for  Month  9  are  tabled  below.  In  month  9  we  have  attributed  £721k  of 
unattributable Acute budget as coding has improved at East & North Herts Trust and costs are 
being assigned to localities. The contingency budget has also been allocated to localities based on 
the year to date fair share of £3.6m, which year date is £2.7m. However, as only £677k has been 
utilised  in  achieving  the  CCG  position,  the  balancing  amount  has  been  transferred  back  to 
unattributable. 

In  the  main  localities  are  underspent  at  month  9,  there  are  only  two  localities  overspent  by  a 
marginal amount.

 4.2.  Programme Budget – Acute Commissioning 

4.2.1  Financial Performance 

Acute contracts reported a YTD overspend of £2.7m and is forecast to overspend by £3.7m (see 
table below). This reported financial position is based on Month 9 SLAM data.  The acute QIPP 
savings for 2017-18 of £14m is shown separately because budget reductions due to QIPP have not 
yet  been  applied  at  individual  provider  level,  with  provider  level  budgets  being  based  on  the 
currently agreed contract values. 

The non-allocation of QIPP by provider means that most providers are showing an underspend 
against  plans,  the  QIPP  needed  to  be  offset  against  this.  Spend  in  the  independent  sector 
continues  to  overspend,  this  is  being  offset  by  underspends  in  NHS  providers  where  there  has 
been a reduction in activity greater than the planned QIPP.

A contract update of some of the CCG key acute providers is as follows: 

•

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust 

East  and  North  Hertfordshire  NHS  Trust  (ENHT)  is  showing  an  under  spend  of  £10m  against 
contract. When this underspend is compared against planned YTD QIPP savings of £6.49m, it is 
safe to assume planned YTD QIPP has delivered. The planned full year QIPP reduction is £9m and 
compared to the forecast outturn, the contract is on track to deliver QIPP.  

At  Month  10,  all  PODs  are  showing  an  activity  under  performance  against  plan  for  ENHCCG. 
Specifically: 

• 
• 

• 
• 
• 

A&E was 3.0% (3,335 attendances) under plan; 
Non-elective  was  6.5%  (2,309  spells)  under  plan,  reducing  to  2.8%  under  plan  when 
excess bed days are excluded; 
Elective was 2.6% (656 spells) under plan; 
Outpatients was 11.0% (39,508) under plan; 
Maternity was 4.5% (679) under plan. 

Compared to previous months, the following was noticeable in Month 10: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

A significant increase in day case activity, with Month 10 showing the highest volume of 
activity  year  to  date  (2,249  compared  to  an  average  of  1,931  between  Month  1  and 
Month 9); 
A significant reduction in inpatient elective activity (392 spells, which is the lowest volume 
to date). This was expected following the national guidance regarding reducing planned 
care work during December 2017 and January 2018; 
An  increase  in  A&E  attendances,  and  similar  level  of  non-elective  activity  compared  to 
Month 9; 
An increase in antenatal pathways and births during January 2018.  

6 

It  should  be  noted  that  there  continues  to  be  some  discrepancies  in  the  Month  10  report 
following  the  implementation  of  Lorenzo.  As  a  result,  there  are  a  few  areas  that  are  currently 
being reviewed by ENHT, including: 

• 

• 

• 

High level of un-coded admitted activity in the Month 10 refresh report. ENHT believes 
that this will start to improve from Month 11 onwards; 
GP heralded and out of hours redirect activity not coming through the system correctly, 
and currently showing as no activity; 
A high volume of un-outcomed outpatient appointments, which is believed to be resulting 
in under reporting of outpatient procedures. 

These issues are being discussed at the CIG meeting and are being closely monitored. 

Figure  1  below  shows  the  main  specialities  that  are  under  or  over  performing  against  plan  for 
non-elective activity year to date to Month 10. 

•

Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust  

The CCG is reporting month 10 year to date expenditure of £47.8m which is £2.4m below straight 
line plan.   

Forecast expenditure of £57.3m is £2.9m below the contract value.  This forecast assumes 80% CQUIN 
achievement in line with previous years, and includes an agreed cap on charges for previously unrecorded 
unwell baby HRGs in line with the part year adjustment included at month 9.  It also includes an estimated 
credit  of  £0.8m  in  respect  of  the  marginal  rate  emergency  rule  whereby  non  elective  activity  over  an 
agreed baseline is funded at 70% rather than 100%.  

• Royal Free NHS Trust 

The Trust is reporting a YTD underspend of £806k and forecast underspend of £943k compared to 
contract as at Month 10 however it should be noted that QIPP has yet to be deducted from the 
contract.  

7 

The main area’s of underspend are in DC and EL with DC underspent by £603k, comprising of an 
underspend in T&O of £120k, Clinical Haematology £75k, Ophthalmology £75k, General Surgery 
£76k, Urology £45k,  Gastroenterology £52k and Dermatology £52k.  

EL  is  underspent  by  £173k  mainly  in  T&O  £265k,  ENT  £74k  and  Breast  Surgery  £70k,  offset  by 
overspends in vascular Surgery £118k, General Surgery £80k and plastic surgery £53k.   

Outpatients has seen an overall underspent of £668k with First Attendances underspent by £281k 
mainly in T&O £37k, Neurology £25k, Geriatric Medicine £19k, Colorectal Surgery £12k, Urology 
£22k, ENT £19k and Ophthalmology £16k.   

Follow-up  appointments  are  also  underspending  by  £163k  comprising  of  T&O  £40k,  Anticoag 
£53k, ENT £21k, Ophthalmology £16k and Rheumatology £25k.  

Non Elective is overspending by £377k, mainly due to T&O £148k, General Surgery £82k, Vascular 
£58k, General Medicine £139k, A&E £118k and Paeds £62k. 

Maternity continues to overspend which is mainly due to casemix and identifying intensive needs 
before being coded.  

•

Independent Sector 

Expenditure with contracted independent sector providers (Ramsay, BMI and Spire) is c£4m over 
contract at Month 10 with an expected forecast of £4.8m over at yearend.   

Expenditure with Ramsay Healthcare continues to be over plan at Month 10, and remains 
relatively equally spread between the Pinehill and Rivers sites. 63% of the overspend at Ramsay 
relates to Inpatients.  Pinehill is significantly overperforming in Outpatients, with expenditure 46% 
above plan.  

At specialty level, the majority of overperformance is in Trauma & Orthopaedics (33% of total), 
with higher variance at Rivers than at Pinehill. The main procedures driving this are knee and hip 
replacements.  There is also continued significant overperformance in Gastroenterology, 
Ophthalmology (mainly cataract extraction), General Surgery, and Urology. 

The overspend is mainly driven by high levels of activity, with both sites seeing a growth in First 
Outpatient activity of between 20-30% since 2016/17.  Activity has been increasing at the Rivers 
site since mid-2015/16, whilst at the Pinehill site activity appears to have increased from early 
2016/17.  This explains the higher overperformance at Pinehill to some degree, as a proportion of 
the earlier growth at Rivers would have been taken into account when planning for 2017/18. 

4.2.2   CCG Activity Performance 

The following charts show total CCG activity trend by point of delivery  

Total outpatient YTD activity is lower than plan by 6.3%, and has been under plan all year to date.

Continuing Healthcare spend remains the main area of concern within non-acute; at Month 10 
the overspend is £3.5m mainly within adult CHC and is forecast to overspend by c£4.3m.  

Community services in total are showing a year to date underspend of £1.1m, HCT by £321k and 
all other community contract by £784k. The main underspends are due to funding which has been 
set aside for potential investments or reprovision which have not yet been committed. 

Intermediate Care is showing an underspend to date of £633k. The service is under review and 
while  the  costs  are  currently  less  than  the  plan  there  are  ongoing  discussions  regarding  the 
medical and therapy inputs to the service and use of beds which may change the charge once the 
service review has been finalised.

Prescribing costs are based on the April – December BSA drug reports and should be noted that a 
new  profile  has  been  released  which  forms  the  basis  of  the  reported  figure.  At  Month  10  GP 
prescribing is £1.3m overspent with a forecast outturn position of £1.5m overspent. The benefit 
of category M price reductions is not being passed to the CCG which may have effect on QIPP 
delivery resulting in an overspend on the prescribing budget. Also, the CCG is experiencing cost 
pressures  relating  to  No  cheaper  stock  obtainable  (NCSO)  drugs.  It  is  noted  there  has  been 
increase in the number of drugs added to the NCSO list since April 2017. The CCG have already 
included a YTD cost pressure of over £2m in this finance report.  

£1 per patient   
The budget is being phased to reflect the pattern of expenditure undertaken by the localities in 
that  during  the  early  part  of  the  financial  year  plans  are  evolved  and  the  costs  for  these  are 
primarily incurred in the second half of the year.   The YTD figures are based on actuals with a 
moderate general accrual of average spend. 

Commissioning Framework  
The annual Budget reflects the 17/18 Components of the CFF at £10.10 per patient population 
(593k)  and  the  Education  &  Development  Component  of  2016/17  which  was  agreed  to  be 
deferred  until  2017/18  to  reflect  more  realistic  planning  and  implementation  process.  The 
balance carried forward from 16/17 was £929k was reflective of the different levels of spend and 
stage of implementation amongst localities at 31/03/17 

4.5 Corporate Running Costs 

The  CCG  corporate  running  cost  is  reporting  an  underspend  YTD  of  £707k  and  a  forecast 
underspend of £745k against the budget set.  

12 

The budget takes into account QIPP savings of £560k and is also £1.2m lower than the allocation 
actually received.  The £1.2m has been added to healthcare budgets.

The  CCG  QIPP  plan  for  2017-18  is  £23.23m  out  of  which  £7m  can  be  evidenced  to  have  fully 
delivered  against  Better  Care  Fund,  Winter  Resilience  and  Running  costs  having  secured 
negotiated  financial  positions  which  are  embedded  within  their  respective  budgets.  The 
remaining £16m relates to demand management schemes and optimising the use of medicines.  

The forecast under-delivery relating to QIPP is £1.04m which has been factored into the reported 
finance position in Month 10, however, the CCG is recognising a risk of £0.6m against the forecast 
QIPP delivery position. Some of these schemes are reviewed regularly with a view to optimising 
the  level  of  delivery  and  where  implementation  is  delayed  to  realise  expected  benefit  in  the 
following year.  

For  those  QIPPs  relating  to  demand  management  especially  within  the  acute  providers,  it  is 
difficult to evidence delivery at individual scheme level. However, a review of 10 months’ activity 
information from SUS shows a reduction in the level of demand and activity compared to contract 
which  provides  some  evidence  that  QIPP  schemes  are  delivering.  From  the  latest  activity  data 

13 

received, CCG Elective activity is 2.0% below plan, total Outpatient activity is 6.4% below plan, 
A&E attendances (excluding follow-ups) are above plan by 0.3% and Non-Elective activity is 2.0% 
above plan. 

The CCG has put in place Governance arrangements for the agreement, approval, monitoring and 
delivery  of  QIPP  schemes  in  order  to  manage  this  risk.  There  is  the  East  and  North  Herts 
Transformation group which was formed to co-ordinate implementation, delivery and monitoring 
of identified QIPP/CIP schemes that impacts East and North Herts Trust which is the CCG’s main 
local provider. 

6. 

KEY FINANCIAL RISKS/MITIGATION MEASURES 

The CCG is currently managing potential risks of £1.15m which may impact the delivery of the CCG 
target financial position if crystallised. 

a)  QIPP under-delivery – There is a risk of £0.6m QIPP under-delivery relating to QIPP schemes 

delivering savings less than currently forecast in the last few months of the year. 

b)  Continuing Healthcare Current (CHC) Adult cases  

CHC expenditure has increased over the past 2 years and is being closely monitored in order 
to highlight any further pressure on this budget. Most of the risks have been included in the 
forecast outturn however there is a residual risk of further increase in expenditure which is 
estimated at £300k (previously £500k) due to potential growth (in number and complexities) 
higher than currently forecast. The CCG is engaging with NHS England who is leading the CHC 
National Strategic Improvement Programme in a way which ensures better outcomes, better 
use of resources and financial efficiency. 

c)  Prescribing costs  

The CCG will not be receiving the benefit of  reduction in Category M (generic drugs) prices in 
2017/18 although this benefit will not be lost as a decision to release these savings to CCG 
will  be  made  later  in  2017/18.  Also,  the  CCG  has  reported  to  NHS  England  on  the  risk  of 
additional  cost  pressure  relating  to  No  cheaper  stock  obtainable  (NCSO)  drugs  which  is 
impacting the prescribing budget. It is noted that there has been increase in the number of 
drugs added to the NCSO list since April 2017. The CCG’s cost pressure is already over £2m 
YTD (FOT £2.8m). The future risk to the CCG is the volatility around the monthly changes to 
the NCSO list which currently cannot be determined. The CCG currently assume a forecast 
broadly in line with current list.  

d)  Patient Transport Service (PTS) 

The CCG’s former key provider of PTS was subject to a winding up order and liquidation so 
unable  to  continue  to  provide  services.    In  the  short  term  the  CCG  made  transitional 
arrangements with East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) and has now entered 
into a longer term contract.  The unit prices in the new contract are higher than the former 
contract, but the CCG is still having to work with other providers on a short term basis, as 
EEAST  does  not  yet  have  capacity  to  deliver  the  full  service.    This  adds  to  the  workload 
pressure on the CCG’s staff, but also adds to financial risk as the CCG commissions more on 
an individual patient basis. These risks are currently estimated at £250k. 

These risks are currently mitigated by contingency held by the CCG.

BALANCE SHEET

7.1  Cash 

The table below shows the total amount of cash utilised compared with the amount that would 
be expected if the annual amount, referred to as maximum cash drawdown (MCD) was spent 
equally throughout the year.  The MCD is calculated as the CCG’s allocation adjusted for non-cash 
items (depreciation), the planned underspend, and the opening cash bank balance.

Executive Summary:  The Governing Body is required to agree a financial plan at 
the start of the year which is affordable within the allocation 
notified  to  it.    Previous  papers  to  the  Governing  Body  have 
provided  an  early  view  of  the  financial  pressures  carried 
forward  from  2017/18  and  arising  during  2018/19.    The 
pressures  are  such  that  a  QIPP  programme  of  £13.450m 
(previously  £13.968m)  is  necessary  to  achieve  financial 
balance.  This  paper  sets  out  proposed  budgets,  which  take 
account  of  2017/18  forecast  outturn  plus  anticipated  growth  and 
QIPP  savings  needed  to  achieve  financial  balance,  i.e.  budgets 
which match the total expected allocation.  These budgets will be 
monitored  in  year  to  ensure  the  CCG  achieves  financial  balance.

1.  Executive summary  

The Governing Body is required to agree a financial plan at the start of the year which 
is affordable within the allocation notified to it. Previous papers to the Governing Body 
have provided an early view of the financial pressures carried forward from 2017/18 
and  arising  during  2018/19.  The  pressures  are  such  that  a  QIPP  programme  of 
£13.450m (previously £13.968m) is necessary to achieve financial balance. This paper 
sets out proposed budgets, which take account of 2017/18 forecast outturn plus anticipated 
growth and QIPP savings needed to achieve financial balance, i.e. budgets which match the 
total  expected  allocation.  These  budgets  will  be  monitored  in  year  to  ensure  the  CCG 
achieves financial balance. There is ongoing process of agreeing revised 2018-19 contracts 
with providers. 

The notified allocation to the CCG and therefore budget does not yet include funds associated 
with  Delegated  Primary  Care  Commissioning.    We  exepct  to  receive  the  formal  2018/19 
allocation notification shortly and will prepare separate budget proposals for this ringdenced 
allocation in April. 

2. Background 

A  first  draft  of  the  strategic  and  financial  outlook  for  2018/19  was  given  in  paper  to  the 
Governing Body in January 2018.  This was based on the planning guidance for the period to 
2020/21:  “Delivering  the  Forward  View:  NHS  planning  guidance”,  published  in  December 
2015, and another guidance published by NHS England and NHS Improvement in September 
2016, (“NHS Operational Planning and Contracting Guidance 2017-2019”).  

In  February  2018,  final  planning  guidance  “Refreshing  NHS  Plan  2018/19”  and  revised 
allocation  to  CCGs  were  issued.  In  addition,  a  few  non  recurrent  allocations  to  be  made 
available in-year were confirmed. 

The final planning assumptions are set out in the table below:

The paper presented to the Governing Body in January 2018 identified a gap of £13.968m 
between  total  funding  and  2018/19  planned  expenditure.    This  has  been  updated  and  the 
total requirement is now calculated at £13.450m.   

In order to achieve the agreed control total the CCG have identified potential QIPP savings of 
£15.223m  (see  table  below)  most  of  which  are  already  worked  up  from  2017/18  and  now 
expected to deliver in 2018/19. The CCG has put in place Governance arrangements for the 
agreement, approval, monitoring and delivery of QIPP schemes. Revised delivery details for 
all  schemes  and  scheduling  milestones  for  delivery  of  key  process  elements  will  be 
presented to the OPD committee in a separate paper.

Acute Services Commissioning 

The default is for two-year contracts in place of those currently negotiated annually, 
and  for  there  to  be  a  two-year  tariff,  two-year  CQUIN  and  CCG  quality  premium 
schemes.  The target deadline for all 2018-19 refreshed contracts to be signed is 
23rd March 2018. However, not all the contract values to be agreed will reflect the 
savings required to achieve financial balance.  The STP is also assisting in ensuring 
that  local  providers  and  commissioners  have  an  aligned  plan.  The  contract 
(including QIPP) has been agreed with East and North Herts Trust while negotiation 
is ongoing with PAH and other Trusts. 

The table below gives a sumary of CCG acute expenditure plan, level of efficiency 
savings and the provider impact.

Additional investments were provided in acute to fund RTT activity, changes in case 
mix and potential coding and counting changes. The CCG also plan to fund realistic 
levels of emergency activity plans and the additional elective activity necessary to 
tackle waiting lists. 

3.2 

Community services 

The  budget  for  community  services  reflects  the  2017/18  recurrent  baseline, 
adjusted by the tariff uplift and demographic growth. It also includes funding transfer 
c£1.1m from Vanguard relating to Homefirst (now rebranded as Community Frailty). 
Increased  funding  was  also  used  to  fund  cost  pressures  of  c£2.4m  mostly  non 
recurrent benefits in 2017/18.     

6 

3.3 

Mental Health services 

As  with  last  year,  one  of  the  requirements  in  the  planning  guidance,  relating  to 
mental health parity, is that CCGs are to ensure that mental health spend rises in 
real terms and grows at least in line with their overall allocation growth, which for 
the CCG is 3.68% for 2018-19.  The increase is being used to fund demography 
increases and  service  developments. Some  of the  schemes  to  be funded  include 
full  year  effect  of  early  intervention  in  psychosis,  Core  24  Psychiatric  Liaison 
Funding in Lister, Children and Mental Health Service and other services to enable 
the CCG move towards meeting the five year forward view requirements. 

 3.4 

Continuing healthcare 

The  budget  is  based  on  2017-18  forecast  outturn  which  is  a  significant  increase 
compared to 2017-18 plan. Additional funding growth of 5.5% was applied to take 
account  of  price  changes,  demographic  growth  and  additional  growth  taking 
account of trends in CHC spend.   

3.5 

Prescribing costs 

The  budget  is  based  on  forecast  outturn  (month  8  actual  prescribing  activity) 
adjusted  for  the  full  year  effect  benefit  of  CAT  M  drugs  (c£1.2m)  to  arrive  at  a 
recurrent  baseline.  Additional  funding  growth  of  4.4%  was  applied  to  account  for 
demographic growth and cost pressures. An efficiency savings of 1.0% is expected 
from the various schemes already identified. 

3.6 

Other primary care 

The budget for primary care services reflects the 2017/18 recurrent baseline which 
means items such as the carried forward underspend on the CFF £2.10 and other 
non  recurrent  spend  were  deducted  from  2017/18  forecast  outturn..  A  net 
demographic  growth  of  3.8%  was  applied.  As  set  out  in  the  General  Practice 
Forward  View,  budgets  also  reflect  the  national  requirement  to  increase  funding 
non-recurrently  in  primary  care  by  £1.50  per  head  in  2017/18  and  in  2018/19  in 
support of practice transformation. The budget is set so as to bring the total funding 
to  the  £3  per  patient  over  the  two  years.  This  is  currently  based  on  our  latest 
forecast of 2017-18 spending and the budget may need to be adjusted once final 
spending for 2017-18 is known.  

3.7 

Corporate budget 

The allocation for running costs has increased by £31k. The budget for 2018/19 is 
based  on  2017-18  plan,  adjusted  for  inflation  of  2.1%  and  a  provision  of  £500k 
made for increased resource requirement due to devolved primary commissioning.   
An efficiency savings of £250k is also built in within corporate costs. 

3.8 

Winter Resilience 

7 

The  CCG  received  non  recurrent  funding  in  2017-18  while  also  committing  its 
resources to fund additional schemes. A total of £1.585m is currently set aside to 
fund existing ongoing commitments in 2018-19. 

3.9 

Contingency reserve 

A  contingency  reserve  of  0.5%  (£3.736m)  has  been  set  aside  to  mitigate  future 
financial pressures. 

4. 

 Control Total 

The CCG agreed in-year control total for 2018-19 is a breakeven financial position, 
meaning the CCG will need to maintain its cumulative underspend at the same level 
on 31/3/2019 as it will be on 31/3/18 (currently forecast to be £14.498m).

5. 

 Risks/Mitigation Measures 

The main risk is the potential under-delivery in planned QIPP  savings. Significant 
changes in activity levels could result in overspend on healthcare contracts (activity 
growth advised within the planning guideline was provided for in the plan). There is 
always risk of growth in Continuing Healthcare and Prescribing thereby leading to 
unavoidable spend. 

6. 

Recommendations 

A summary of the budgets is shown in Appendix 1.  This shows an in-year position 
of breakeven, against the control total.  The Governing Body is asked to approve 
these budgets.  

7. Next Steps  

Next steps are:

•  CCG executive to agree the QIPP programme with partners 
•  Further  work  to  disaggregate  the  total  costs  and  set  detailed  budgets  at

Report signed off 
by: 
Executive Summary At  the  end  of  December  2017  the  CCG  has  a  forecast  overspend 
against its prescribing allocation, of £1.495M (1.87%) against a budget 
of  £79.8M  (incl.  QIPP  savings).  The  overspend  has  worsened  since 
November  despite  price  reductions  in  the  Drug  Tariff  from  Aug  1st. 
These  are  regarded  as  ‘windfall  savings’  by  NHSE  and  are  clawed 
back for the central reserves. To December, this amounted to £485K. 
Also  contributing  to  the  overspend  have  been  considerable  cost 
pressures from drugs in short supply that have increased in cost. The 
effect of these to February 18 is calculated to be almost £2.7M. Apart 
from these, increased spend continues on NOACs and new drugs for 
the management  of  diabetes.  Set  against this are  the  savings made 
by the In-Practice Pharmacist team which, annualised, amount to over 
£1M  with  the  majority  of  this  coming  from  switching  from  brand  to 
generic  prescribing  of  pregabalin.  Other  key  pieces  of  work  are  in 
hand  or  planned  for  early  in  the  next  financial  year.  The  domiciliary 
oxygen  budget  is  underspent  by  £185K  to  January.  To  date 
challenges  to  secondary  care  providers  over  charges  for  high  cost 
drugs  for  2017-18,  equate  to  £485K  of  agreed  credits  in  the  CCG’s 
favour. 
There  are  five  prescribing  metrics  this  year.  At  present  the  two  that 
relate  to  antibacterial  prescribing  are  being  achieved  by  the  CCG 
which  should  receive  a  QP  payment  from  NHSE.  There  is  virtually 
across-the-board improvement on the other metrics. There remains a 
considerable overall focus on antimicrobial stewardship with a number 
of  initiatives  underway  including  support  for  a  new  care  pathway  to 
minimise  the  incidence  of  urinary  tract  infection  in  residents  of  care 
homes and prevent unnecessary attendance at A&E.  
The prescribing decisions of HMMC from the December 2017 & 
January 2018 meetings were ratified by Governing Body workshops in 
January & February respectively. Six NICE appraisals were included 
and 15 other CCG guidelines or decisions. The workplan and cost 
pressures for 2018-19 were also presented. 
The success of the Care Home Pharmacy team (as part of the NHSE 
Vanguard project) has been recognised and will continue as business 
as usual after the project finishes on March 31st.

Prescribing Report 

Meeting Date 22nd March 2017 

1. Executive Summary 

See cover sheet. 

2. Background 

This report informs the Governing Body of the financial position of ENHCCG practices against their 
respective budgets at December 31st 2017 and the progress against the local medicines 
optimisation agenda to date of meeting. The report and appendices present an overall summary of 
all the key performance indicators and QIPP projects related to prescribing for the year to date 
including GP prescribing costs, ScriptSwitch® activity, and prescribing KPIs. 

-  Appendix 1a, 1b – Locality-level Finance Report 
-  Appendix 1c - Prescribing KPIs 2017/18 
-  Appendix 2 - Vanguard Medicines Optimisation Care Home Project dashboard  
(Each element is available to practice level to support local monitoring, and this data is shared 
with each Locality and practice prescribing lead by their Pharmaceutical Adviser regularly 
throughout the year). 

3. Issues 

•  The CCG is currently predicted to overspend on prescribing by £1.495M on what is a 

challenging budget compared to the 2016-17 end-of-year position. 

•  To this has to be added the Category M ‘clawback’ by NHSE which stands at £487K to 

December 2017. 

•  The IPP team which supports practices is now almost at full strength. 
•  The  CCG  is  on  target  to  receive  all  its  NHSE  QP  payments  in  relation  to  antimicrobial 

prescribing including one element that is not being GP-incentivised this year.

6. Risks & Mitigating Actions 

6.1 Primary Care Prescribing Expenditure 

Please  refer  to  Appendix  1a.  At  31st  December  2017,  ENHCCG  had  spent  £62,522,644  before 
adjustments,  against  a  primary  care  prescribing  budget  of  £79,805,990  (practices  and  other 
services).  Growth  2017/18  vs  2016/17  is  forecasted  to  be  2.07%,  and  currently  exceeds  the 
England rate. This is a jump from the last report and may be an effect of the NHSBSA revising its 
forecasting  profile  from  December  onwards.  There  is  a  forecast  overspend  at  year-end  of 
£1,494,612. The primary care prescribing budget for 2017-18 is very challenging as the uplift on 
the 2016-17 out-turn was  minimal after the required QIPP savings target of £3.2m was applied. 
Despite the work undertaken by practices with the support of the CCG’s care home and in-practice 
pharmacists,  the  savings  generated  are  being  cancelled  out  by  the  NHSE  clawback  of  savings 
from cost reductions of Drug Tariff Category M medicines and price concessions being applied to 
products in short supply – see Table 1. 

NHSE published ‘Refreshing NHS Plans for 2018/19’ in February 2018, This states that CCGs 
should assume that the current high level of discretionary prices for generic drugs in short 
supply will not persist in 2018/19. In 2018/19, CCGs will receive the remaining period (April-
July 18) of temporary benefit from changes made to Category M generic drug prices designed 

3 

to recover excess community pharmacy margin from previous years (i.e. the Cat M clawback 
will not continue beyond 2017/18). Beyond this, no assessment has yet been made of whether 
upward or downward adjustments to generic drugs prices will be needed in 2018/19 to reflect 
under or over-delivery of community pharmacy margin delivered in 2016/17 and 2017/18. So 
‘no allowance for this should be included in CCG plans’.

Without the clawback and the unpredictable price concessions, the CCG would be forecasting an 
under-spend on prescribing, assisted by the work undertaken as part of prescribing QIPP plans. 

The  PMOT  in-practice  pharmacists  (IPP)  have  systematically  completed  a  number  of  initiatives 
with GPs which have delivered annualised savings totalling over £1 million in the financial year to 
date. The most significant saving to date continues to come from the switch of branded pregabalin 
to  the  generic  form.  Additional  significant  savings  have  come  from  the  dose  optimisation  of 
pregabalin. Prioritisation is now being given to the switch from tiotropium bromide 18microgram to 
Braltus Zonda®. Work has been initiated in 22 practices to date and all practices have been offered 
the switch.  

A  protocol  has  been  agreed  to  support  practices  with  a  switch  to  branded  generic  mesalazine 
tablets  which  could  also  deliver  significant  savings  and  is  being  recommended  across  the  STP 
area.  This  will  be  the  next  major  piece  of  work  for  the  team,  to  start  in  April.  The  switch  is 
supported by gastroenterology colleagues in ENHT.

The figures do not include cost avoidance from ad-hoc pieces of work or avoided admissions as a 
result of other interventions made by the team. Work continues to be supported by a governance 
structure and is protocol-driven.  

There has been little change in the drug groups providing the highest growth in spend. Scrutiny of 
the top 50 growth areas for the CCG once again shows NOAC drugs, in particular apixaban at the 
top, our growth in anticoagulant spend over the same period in the last year is over £800K. This is 
followed by a number of drugs that have been on price concession such as quetiapine, olanzapine 

4 

(antipsychotics),  levetiracetam  (anti-epileptic),  amlodipine  (for  high  blood  pressure),  and  several 
drugs for migraine. The increased spend on newer agents to manage diabetes continues. 

Following a public consultation East and North Herts CCG (ENHCCG) (and Herts Valleys CCG) 
implemented a new ‘Policy for the Commissioning of Over-the-Counter Medicines’ for short-term 
and intermittent illnesses on January 1st 2018. Patients including those who are exempt from 
paying a prescription levy will now be expected to pay for over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for 
minor and/or self-limiting conditions that can be managed through self-care. In many cases, the 
cost to the patient will be less than a prescription charge and will be significantly less than the cost 
to the NHS if the treatment were prescribed. Exclusions would include patients with safeguarding 
concerns and treatments for diagnosed long-term conditions. This includes when there are legal 
restrictions on the amount of medication available over-the-counter and if the licensing of the OTC 
product is restricted. GPs are expected to make a clinical judgement and the care of the individual 
patient must remain their primary concern. The effects of implementing the policy are being 
monitored through analysis of prescribing data and monitoring of patient comments/complaints. 
http://www.enhertsccg.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Jan2018/OTC-Policy-Dec17-
V1.0_FINAL.pdf

Also following a public consultation, ENHCCG and HVCCG implemented a policy for the provision 
of gluten free (GF) foods in January 2018.  The CCGs do not support the routine NHS prescribing 
of GF foods, with limited exceptions. On 1st February, the Department of Health and Social Care 
(DHSC) published a report of responses following their public consultation on GF Foods. The 
government has adopted option 3 of the public consultation to restrict GF prescriptions to certain 
foods (e.g. bread and mixes) which will be implemented through formal change to the NHS 
prescribing regulations and will be a complex process that may take some time. The report clarifies 
that its recommendations do not affect the statutory authority that a CCG has to determine the 
availability of GF foods in their local area – and to potentially go further if that is what is supported 
locally. In light of this, the Governing Body has recently considered the following options: 
•  Maintain the CCG’s current policy 
•  Maintain the CCG’s current policy and review once the list of products (e.g. breads and mixes) 

to be made available on NHS prescription is published 

•  Amend the CCG’s current policy to allow prescribing of all breads and mixes 
•  Revert to previous local prescribing policy allowing routine prescribing of limited volumes of 

GF food for certain products 

The Governing Body has reflected on the local consultation process and the experience across the 
STP and agreed by consensus to maintain the CCG’s current policy. 

6.2 Domiciliary Oxygen  
The spend  on  domiciliary  oxygen  supplies  at  January  2018  was  £509,361  which  gives  a  £185K 
underspend  on  the  year-to-date  budget.  Details  of  individual  patient  activity  are  shared  with 
practices bi-monthly.  

6.3 ScriptSwitch® electronic messages at the point of prescribing 
The latest annualised savings (i.e. net savings after costs, made in year grossed up) for a 12-
month period at January 2018 are estimated at £313K. The monthly CCG rate of acceptance of 
offered switches to GPs remains consistently around 50% (to February) but the variation between 
practices ranges from 4% to 85%. 

6.4 KPIs
Appendix 1b sets out Locality performance against the five key prescribing metrics agreed for 
inclusion in the 2017-18 ‘Consolidated Funding Framework’ for general practice. All localities and 
thus the CCG are achieving the current QP targets for antimicrobial prescribing and have improved 
since the previous report. All localities have improved on the other three indicators except for Stort 
Valley and Villages on oral nutrition. However whilst individual practices may be improving 
achievement on the three “non antibiotic” KPIs, only North Herts and Stevenage localities as a 

5 

whole are achieving the threshold and then just for the KPI measuring blood glucose monitoring 
test choices. 

6.5 Community Pharmacy 
The CCG continues to maintain its working with relationship with community pharmacy via its link 
with the Local Pharmaceutical Committee, a representative of which sits on PCMMG with the GP 
locality leads. The LPC is also represented on the STP pharmacist leads group. The CCG has 
commissioned six of the “extended opening” pharmacies (one per locality) that were already 
signed up to our ‘Immediate Access to Emergency Medicines’ service, to hold additional stocks of 
anti-viral medicines to support the management of influenza outbreaks over the winter, particularly 
in care homes. This is likely to be an ongoing requirement in order to support any actions that need 
to be undertaken in the ‘out of flu season’ period too if we experience any localised outbreaks. 

6.6  Improving  Prescribing  of  Antibacterials  (‘Antimicrobials  Stewardship’)  including  self-
care 

•  The  CCG  is  on  course  to  achieve  all  NHSE  QP  primary  care  targets  for  antimicrobial 

prescribing set for 2017-18. 

•  To  date  there  has  been  a  4%  reduction  in  total  antibiotic  prescribing  per  denominator 

(antibacterial STAR-PUs) 12 months to December 2017 vs 12 months to April. 

•  The CCG ratio of broad-spectrum antibiotics to all antibacterial prescribing remains below 

national target levels for CCGs (10%). 

•  PMOT  have  supported  the  CCG  infection  control  lead  in  assessing  Provider  appeals 

against sanctions for excess numbers of C.difficile cases. 

•  Educational sessions have been delivered at locality level to clinical staff at GP practices. 

The focus was on antibiotic prescribing and antimicrobial resistance – delivered by PMOT. 

•  Distribution of PHE leaflets (‘Treating your infection’ and other promotional materials part of 
the national ‘Keep Antibiotics Working’ campaign) to all GP practices to promote self-care 
and reduce patient requests for antibiotics was undertaken. 

•  The  smartphone  app  which  is  based  on  the  latest  local  Hertfordshire  antimicrobial 

guidelines for primary care has now been downloaded over 3000 times.  

• There is an ongoing trial of point of care CRP testing to facilitate appropriate antibiotic 
prescribing for patients presenting with lower respiratory tract infections in practices in 
Sawbridgeworth. This is being facilitated by PMOT. Early data suggests that 13% fewer 
patients received oral antibiotics associated with lower respiratory tract infections in five 
practices using the test in November and December 2017 vs November and December 
2016.

•  There has been continued development of a new pathway for the management of Urinary 
Tract Infections (UTIs) in Care Homes. Data from a pilot in a single local Care Home has 
seen a 75% reduction in antibiotics prescribed for UTIs and a 67% reduction in UTI related 
hospital  admissions  in  a  seven  month  period  -  July  2017  to  Jan  2018  compared  to  the 
same period in the previous year. 

6.7 High Cost Drugs Use in Secondary Care  
In 2017-18 to date, £10.1M worth of National Tariff- excluded high cost drug (HCD) charges to the 
CCG  have  been  scrutinised  by  PMOT  staff  resulting  in  challenges  of  £2.4M  being  made  to 
providers.  Challenges raised target poor data quality and 'quick win' credits (e.g. non-ENHCCG 
patient, NHSE drug / indication / paediatric charges and drugs charged at a higher unit price than 
expected) and query issues with Contract Leads/host commissioners where necessary (e.g. risk-
share / gain share agreements, Homecare charges, and local prices).  £485K of credit has been 
agreed  against  these.  The  volume  of  work  involved  for  PMOT  staff  validating  up  to  26  HCD 
datasets  each  month  and  then  reviewing  subsequent  Trust  responses  to  challenges  raised, 
remains  considerable  and  deadlines  are  tight. More  staff  has  had  to  be  deployed  to  this  work 
stream.

6.8 Engagement with Acute & Provider Trusts
CCG Lead Pharmacist & GP support for East & North Herts NHS Trust’s New Drugs & Formulary 
Committee continues. There is pharmacist but not GP attendance at their Therapeutics Policy 
Committee. CCG senior pharmacists also provide input to the Drugs and Therapeutics committee 
for Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust and the West Essex Medicines 
Optimisation Programme Board. CCG Lead Pharmaceutical Adviser also supports the East of 
England Priority Advisory Committee (collaboration of East of England CCGs which makes 
advisory commissioning recommendations for medicines/devices for consideration by CCGs). 
Senior PMOT pharmacists are also in regular dialogue with their opposite numbers in the STP 
partnership including Community Pharmacist representatives. The aims are to avoid duplication, 
promote sharing and implement STP system wide medicines optimisation initiatives. 

6.81 Hertfordshire Medicines Management Committee (HMMC) 

Reports/recommendations from the December 2017 and February 2018 HMMC meetings were 
ratified at the Governing Body Workshops on 4th January and 22nd February 2018 respectively. A 
summary of recommendations is below: 

HMMC recommendations for the following mandatory NICE Technology Appraisal (TA) treatments 
which are the commissioning responsibility of the CCG were ratified and any associated costs 
noted:

Items which should not routinely be prescribed in primary care (low value medicines) - HMMC 
approved the NHS England/NHS Clinical Commissioners guidance recommendations for 14 
out of 18 drugs and agreed ‘double red’ status (not recommended for prescribing in primary or 
secondary care). Estimated annual primary care prescribing costs for these 14 medicines is 
approx. £690k. The remaining 4 medicines from the guidance (immediate release fentanyl; 
lidocaine plasters; liothyronine; travel vaccines) require further consultation with local 
specialists and GPs concerning recommendations and use in new and existing patients. This 
will be presented at a future HMMC meeting.

•  Emollients guidelines (update) - recommended for use 
•  DEKAs® Plus vitamin supplement for cystic fibrosis - recommended for restricted use 
•  Blood glucose test strips for type 2 diabetes (updated guidance and choices) - recommended 

for use 

Horizon scanning and drug cost pressures/savings for 2018/19 
HMMC noted and approved the drug cost pressure/saving estimates for 2018/19 for reporting to 
CCG Governing Body (total estimated cost pressure: £3.3m; saving from generics/biosimilars: 
£510k) and these were separately noted by the CCG Governing Body and have been reported to 
the CCG Finance Team. 

HMMC updated terms of reference (ToR) 
HMMC approved the updated HMMC ToR and this was ratified by the CCG Governing Body 

NICE TAs that are the commissioning responsibility of NHS England 
HMMC and the Governing Body noted 22 NICE TAs for medicines and indications that are the 
commissioning responsibility of NHS England. 

Recommendation documents/guidelines and relevant funding application pro-formas for providers 
have been uploaded to the CCG website (funding application pro-formas also available on Blueteq 
system): http://www.enhertsccg.nhs.uk/local-decisions.   

6.82 Primary Care Medicines Management Group (PCMMG) 

To date, the PCMMG has met five times this year to provide direction on the practical 
implementation of the decisions of HMMC and to discuss and advise on medicines optimisation 
strategic QIPP priorities for 2017-18 and beyond. PCMMG considered the relevant HMMC 
recommendations from the December and February meetings that have an impact on primary care 
and the views of PCMMG were subsequently included in the HMMC reports to the CCG. PCMMG 
considered draft medicines optimisation metrics for inclusion in the 2018-19 Consolidated Funding 
Framework for practices at its meeting on March 1st and the recommendations have been passed 
to the CCG commissioning team.

The care home pharmacy team have now worked with 52 care homes across the CCG since they 
started; returning to several cares homes when requested by the CCG Quality Team. This financial 
year they have worked with 23 care homes. Several new ones are opening in the CCG and the 

8 

team are working with them and their aligned GP practices as soon as is possible to ensure good 
systems and processes are in place. 
So far this year, 629 residents have had a medication review, equating to 6173 medicines and 22% 
(1363) medicines have been stopped, 688 of which could be linked to potential falls. The 
annualised direct drug savings to date in 2017-18 are £99,321 (£158/patient reviewed) Estimated 
RIO (hospital admission reductions savings) are £298,369.  

One of the pharmacists has completed their independent prescribing course and two have started 
the course and will finish early summer. The team are working with HVCCG and HCPA to develop 
a suite of resources to support care homes and developing training packages to enhance 
medicines management and safety in care homes. Resources to remind care homes how to 
minimise waste are also being distributed.  

Following the positive outcomes from the dedicated enhanced nutrition service within the project, 
the CCG will continue to commission this service from HCT next year. Annualised savings from 
stopping or reducing unnecessary oral nutrition products are £112,882 (215 patients have had their 
ONS reviewed). Care home staff have been trained on how to identify, measure and treat 
malnutrition using ‘food first’ principles. Dietetic and care home staff continue to monitor residents 
where ONS has been stopped to ensure effective and appropriate nutrition. Although the NHSE 
Care Home Vanguard project comes to an end shortly, the success of the project means the work 
stream becomes ‘business as usual’ and the model will continue to be shared and implemented 
across the STP. The staff will be retained. 

6.10 PMOT Human Resources & Miscellaneous Items 
Two new In-Practice Pharmacists were employed and started in January. Recruitment will be 
undertaken in the spring for a third. Other pieces of work carried out by the team to enhance 
medicines optimisation since the November 2017 report include: 

•  On-going scrutiny of Ardens ‘’Medicine Formulary’’ templates to identify those needing 

amendment to bring them into line with local recommendations. 

•  On-going professional input to STP work-streams including Frailty, End of Life  
•  Active participation in the STP medicines optimisation work stream. 
•  On-going support in the management of local influenza outbreaks. 
•  Support to Stort Valley & Villages locality as they actively recruit for a GP based clinical 
pharmacist to join the group already recruited across the CCG as part of NHS England’s 
General Practice Forward View initiatives. 

•  Pharmaceutical advice to the work stream implementing NHSE directive to provide 

Extended Access to general practice services. 

•  Production of support materials for the CCG Communications and Patient Experience 
teams when faced with enquiries from patients in respect of the interim decision not to 
recommend local prescribing of Freestyle Libre® interstitial glucose tests. 

•  Provided draft responses to six Freedom of Information requests and one press enquiry 

related to medicines to the relevant CCG officers. 

•  Support to practices in managing prescriber changes not actioned by NHSE. 

7. Recommendations 
The Governing Body is asked to note the financial position as at December 2017 and the work 
undertaken by practices and the PMOT to provide quality services to our population, within 
available resources.  

8. Next Steps 
The next prescribing report will be presented for information and discussion at the July 2018 
meeting of the Governing Body held in public and will reflect the end of year position for 2017-18.

Seasonal Flu Report 2017/18 

Decision or Approval

Discussion

Information

Report author: 

Emily Perry, Project Officer – Primary Care  
James Gleed, Associate Director – Primary Care  

Report signed off by:  Harper Brown, Director of Commissioning 

Executive Summary: 

The 2017/18 Seasonal flu report has been written to inform the 
Governing Body of the results from the 2017/18 National Flu 
Immunisation Programme for East and North Hertfordshire CCG 
and to highlight any known national changes to the programme for 
next year. 

Uptake improved when compared to the 2016/17 figures in all three 
key groups (over 65s, under 65s at risk and pregnant women) as 
well as in children aged 2, 3 and 4.  The CCG did not meet the 
nationally set targets in the three key groups (over 65s, under 65s 
at risk and pregnant women), however it came very close in the 
over 65s and pregnant women categories and was just 0.9% away 
from meeting the national target for both of the aforementioned 
groups. ENHCCG was commended by PHE East of England for 
their achievements and at the end of January 2018 ENHCCG was 
the highest performing CCG in terms of vaccine uptake for the over 
65s, pregnant women and 2 & 3 year olds across the NHS England 
Midlands & East (Central Midlands) patch. 

NHS England issued guidance to GP practices and pharmacies in 
January 2018 around the types of vaccines that they should be 
ordering for the 2018/19 season. The 2018/19 National flu plan is 
expected to be released in May 2018.

3.2 Planning, Communications and Support for Practices 
The  CCG  continues  to  attend  the  Flu  Planning  Task  Group  (FPTG)  which  is  led  by  Public 
Health England (PHE) and is also attended by representatives from the LPC, the LMC, HCC 
and  other  CCGs.  The  group  is  now  reviewing  uptake  figures  from  the  2017/18  season  and 
focusing on plans for the 2018/19 season.  

3 

3.3  As  with  the  2016/17  season,  ENHCCG  offered  extra  funding  to  localities  for the  2017/18 
season to develop a co-ordinated local plan in order to help increase vaccine uptake figures. 
The funding available was calculated pro rata based on patient list size and can be seen below 
in table 2:

3.4 Some of the initiatives that localities included in their flu plans were:  

•  Ordering banners, badges and t-shirts and promoting the flu jab with various displays, as 

well as sharing promotional materials with pharmacies.   

•  Using  MJOG  (an  automated  text  and  email  messaging  service)  to  send  targeted  text 

messages to eligible patients.  

•  Advertising  flu  clinics  in  local  papers  –  to  include  community  pharmacies  offering 

•  Having a practice flu champion with whom pharmacists can liaise with and vice versa.   
•  Working with district nurses to vaccinate house bound patients and carers and working 

vaccines. 

with midwives.   

•  Buddying higher performing practices with lower performing practices. 
•  Putting messages on prescriptions – to include pharmacies offering vaccines. 

3.5  Five  out  of  the  six  localities  had  their  plans  for  extra  funding  approved  by  the  CCG 
Governing Body; it was agreed that the sixth locality (Stevenage) would be awarded the funding 
upon meeting national set targets (as listed in table 1 above) and whilst the locality as a whole 
didn’t meet these targets (locality achievements can be found in Table 4 below), three practices 
did meet targets in one  or more of the three main eligible groups and have been awarded a 
proportion of the funding accordingly. 

4.  Pharmacy  

Community pharmacies were again commissioned nationally to vaccinate eligible patients. NHS 
England locally commissioned PharmOutcomes software for the 2017/18 season to enable fast 
electronic transfer of vaccination information to GP practices. Feedback from practices will be 
collated in the coming weeks. It has not yet been decided whether this will be commissioned for 
the  2018/19  season.  As  part  of  the  locality  flu  funding  practices  were  asked  to  work  with 
community  pharmacies  to  encourage  better  working  relationships  and  ensure  that  between 
them more people were offered flu vaccinations.

5.  Midwifery 

PHE worked with East and North Herts Trust (ENHT) to ensure that midwives were set up to 
deliver the flu vaccination to pregnant women during the 2017/18 season.  

6.  Achievement  

Practice and CCG level data was available on Immform from the start of the flu season to the 
end of January 2018. CCG level data is available below in table 3 – the CCG has improved in 
all of the three main categories from the 2016/17 season as well as with 2,3 and 4 year olds.

6.2 ENHCCG’s performance against national targets  

Whilst ENHCCG hasn’t met the national targets for the three key eligible groups (over 65s, 
under 65s at risk and pregnant women), the CCG has been commended by PHE East of 
England for achieving 74.1% in the over 65s group (just 0.9% off of meeting the national target 
of 75%).  The CCG was also just 0.9% off meeting the national target of 55% for pregnant 
women.  

The challenge in terms of actual numbers of patients to be vaccinated gets harder each year as 
the actual number of patients over 65 years old is growing at 7%+, so practices need to 
vaccinate more people per year in order to meet the same national target. It is hoped that by 
continuing to work with practices and sharing best practice we will get closer to the national 
target at the end of the 2018/19 season.  Whilst the CCG hasn’t quite met the national targets, a 
number of individual practices did meet these targets in all three of the key categories (from 
Immform data at 31 January 2018) these were:

6.3 The CCG will be collecting learning from high achieving practices and will report back on 
this to the Governing Body and practices later in the year ahead of the 2018/19 flu season.

6.6  CCG Performance Compared with other local CCGs 
During the 2017/18 season East and North Herts CCG were regularly commended by PHE East 
of England for their achievements and at the end of January 2018 ENHCCG was the highest 
performing CCG in terms of vaccine uptake for the over 65s, pregnant women and 2 & 3 year 
olds across the NHS England Midlands & East (Central Midlands) patch. We believe this 
success is due to a combination of having a clear joint plan for the locality and then co-
ordinating all the hard work done by each practice working together across localities including 
all Care Homes.  

6  Changes for the 2018/19 season 

7.1 In January 2018 NHS England issued guidance to GP practices and community pharmacies 
on vaccine ordering for the 2018/19 season and asked that vaccines were ordered as below as 
research has found that these vaccinations offer the best protection for the below listed cohorts: 

• The adjuvanted trivalent vaccine (aTIV) for all 65s and over. Given aTIV was only 

licensed for use in the UK in August 2017, this was not an option for the 2017/18 
season. However the JCVI advice is that this is now the best option for 2018/19 for 65+ 
age group  

• The quadrivalent vaccine (QIV) for 18 – under 65s at risk. In light of an independent 
cost-effectiveness study into QIV undertaken by Public Health England and considered 
by JCVI, the Green Book was updated in October 2017 to provide the advice that QIV is 
the best option for 18-65 at-risk groups in the 2018/19 season. It is also used for the 
childhood programme.  

7.2 PHE are attending a national meeting on 20 March 2018 where any changes to the 2018/19 
flu programme will be discussed; the final flu plan for 2018/19 is expected to be released in May 
2018.  

7.3 The local PHE / NHS England team are holding an event on 18 April 2018 for secondary 
care staff with the aim of engaging them further in flu and in turn helping to reduce the impact of 
flu on A&E and other hospital services.  The event will inform secondary care providers of work 
that is already taking place in Milton Keynes Hospital where patients who are eligible and at risk 
are vaccinated ad-hoc in hospital clinics (e.g diabetes clinics, neurology clinics, paediatrics etc) 
rather than being sent to their GP or pharmacy. The CCG has encouraged local providers to 
attend and engage in these developments.  

7  Next Steps 

The CCG will have an end of season de-brief with the flu leads for each locality in the coming 
weeks to assess how localities felt the season went and what could be done to improve uptake 
during the 2018/19 season.  

The  CCG  will  continue  to  work  with  PHE  via  the  Flu  Planning  Task  Group  as  well  as  with

Introduction 

The  final  NHS  national  staff  survey  report  for  2017  was  published  by  the  NHS  Survey 
Coordination Centre on 06 March 2018. This year, the survey went out to almost 1.1million 
staff  across  309  trusts, clinical  commissioning  groups  and  commissioning  support  units  in 
England. 

Staff were eligible to take part if they were employed directly by an NHS organisation on the 
1st September 2017. The number of staff members who took part in the survey between 
October and December 2017, via either a postal or online questionnaire, was 487,227.  This 
constituted an overall response rate of 45% for the Staff Survey 2017; an increase from 44% 
for the 2016 version. 

The  East  and  North  Hertfordshire  CCG’s  response  rate  was  65.2%  (184  staff).  This  report 
gives the headline information made available in the final report.

Achievements to Celebrate 

This section sets out the results which were statistically significantly better than other CCGs 
surveyed,  together  with  other  results  that  stand  out  at  this  initial  analysis  as  being  an 
achievement when benchmarked against other CCGs. 

A number of the CCG’s results were positive and similar to those achieved in other CCGs.  
The following results, however, were better than other CCGs: 

97% of staff were appraised in the last 12 months – other CCGs 84% 
55% of staff/colleagues reported most recent experience of harassment bullying or 
abuse – other CCGs 40% – the higher score the better 
92% of staff reported witnessing errors, near misses or incidents in the last month – 
other CCGs 92% - the higher score the better
9% of staff experienced harassment, bullying or abuse from service users, relatives 
or the public in the last 12 months – other CCGs 10% – the lower the score the better
Satisfaction with the quality of work and care, staff are able to deliver 3.74 (other 
CCGs 3.74) - the higher score the better

It was also identified that 99% of staff completed mandatory training in the past 12 months, 
compared to 97% of other CCGs. 

3.

Areas for Improvement 

This section sets out the results which were statistically significantly worse than other CCGs 
surveyed, together with other results that stand out at this initial analysis as being an area 
for potential improvement when benchmarked against other CCGs. 

Page | 2 

The following results were worse than other CCGs: 

3% of staff (i.e. 5 people) experienced physical violence from colleagues in the CCG, 
who are not their manager – other CCGs 0%  
Quality  of  appraisals  were  rated  as  3.01  (other  CCGs  3.33)  -  the  higher  score  the 
better
33% of staff reported good communication between senior management and staff - 
other CCGs 50% - the higher score the better
56% of staff attending work in the last 3 months despite feeling unwell because they 
felt pressure from their manager, colleagues or themselves  – other CCGs 49% - the 
lower the score the better
13% staff experiencing discrimination at work in the last 12 months -  other CCGs 8%
- the lower the score the better

The  following  areas  are  also  identified  as  areas  for  some  improvement,  as  benchmarked 
against other CCGs: 

55%  of  staff  reported  they  were  satisfied  with  recognition  for  good  work  –  other 
CCGs 63%
40% of staff reported that they were satisfied with their level of pay – other CCGs 
50%
69%  of  staff  reported  that  their  immediate  manager  encourages  team  working  –  
other CCGs 76% 
33%  of  staff  reported  that  senior  managers  try  to  involve  them  in  important 
decisions – other CCGs 42%
45% of staff felt supported by manager to receive training, learning or development 
identified in their appraisal – other CCGs 55%
62% of staff reported that they were satisfied with opportunities for flexible working 
patterns – other CCGs 73%
71% of staff confirmed that their immediate manager could be counted upon to help 
with difficult tasks – other CCGs 77%
36% of staff confirmed that senior managers act on staff feedback – other CCGs 42%
29% of staff confirmed that the CCG definitely takes positive action on health and 
well-being – other CCGs 35%

Appendix 1 provides a summary of the top and bottom ranking score findings for the CCG by 
department. 

4.

Next Steps 

It is suggested that further interrogation of survey results be carried out to determine and 
target areas of concern and an action plan be developed to address issues identified. The 
action  plan  is  to  be  developed  in  partnership  with  the  Staff  Partnership  Forum  and  that 
progress against the plan is monitored by the Executive.

(ENHCCG) Gender Pay Gap Report

Paul Curry - Equality and Diversity Lead 

Report signed off 
by: 

Hein Scheffer 
Director of Workforce

Executive 
Summary: 

This is the 2017 East and North Herts Clinical Commissioning 
Group (ENHCCG) Gender Pay Gap report. 

Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 
or more employees to publish statutory calculations every 
year showing how large the pay gap is between their male 
and female employees.  

The results must be published on the employer's website and 
a designated government website.  

Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay. Equal pay 
deals with the pay differences between men and women who 
carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It 
is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man 
or a woman.  

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay 
between all men and women in a workforce. If a workforce 
has a particularly high gender pay gap the calculations help 
to identify if there are any issues that could be looked at in 
more detail.  

This report shows that the average (mean) gender pay gap is 
10.7% and that the median gender pay gap is 0%.

Recommendations  
to the members: 

  To note the findings of the Gender Pay Gap analysis, 

produced as required by the Equality Act 2010 (Specific 
Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 

Conflicts of Interest 
involved: 

  No potential conflicts of interest identified

1. Executive Summary: 

1.1 This report supports the CCG to meet the legal requirement to publish its Gender 

Pay Gap information.  

1.2 For gender pay gap reporting, we don’t need to know what most people earn – 

the median – but also how the outliers affect the overall distribution of pay 
between men and women – the mean.  

1.3 The mean figure gives us an overall indication of the size of our gender pay gap, 

if any. 

1.4 The median gives us an indication of what the ‘typical’ situation is for pay 

difference between male and female staff.  

1.5 The data for East and North Hertfordshire CCG shows that the average (mean) 

gender pay gap, the amount more that male employees earn compared to 
female employees, is 10.7%, and that the median gender pay gap is 0%.  

1.6 As the mean figure is above the median figure this indicates that the data could 

be skewed by a group of high earners. If the majority of employees in those 
groups of earners are mainly men or mainly women, a gender pay gap issue 
arises. 

2. Background 

2.1 Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay 

differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs 
or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a 
man or a woman. 

2.2 Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees 

to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is 
between their male and female employees. 

2.3 The results must be published on the employer's website and a designated 

government website. The deadline for publication is the 31st March 2018 and 
annually thereafter.  

2.4 The NHS terms and conditions of service handbook contain the national 

agreements on pay and conditions of service for NHS staff other than very senior 
managers and medical staff. 

2.5 Job evaluation enables jobs to be matched to national job profiles and allows 
CCGs to evaluate jobs locally, to determine in which Agenda for Change pay 
band a post should sit. 

Page | 3 

3. The Gender Pay Gap indicators 
An employer must publish six calculations showing their:  

•  Average gender pay gap as a mean average;  
•  Average gender pay gap as a median average;  
•  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups (quartiles) 

ordered from lowest to highest pay;  

•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean;  
•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median; and 
•  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females 

receiving a bonus payment

4.4 Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean and average bonus gender pay 
gap as a median: A gender bonus gap cannot be calculated as we have only one 
bonus paid in the period.  

4.5 Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females 
receiving a bonus payment: Males 0% Females 0.5% 

5. Analysis 

5.1 We already collect and publish a breakdown of pay by gender as part of our 

reporting requirements under the Equality Act. This was brought to Board on 18 
January 2018. The snapshot date that we use for our equality data reports is the 
1 November each year, so different from the 5th April snapshot date for the 
gender pay gap report.  

5.2 Using the 1st November 2017 figures was can start to identify why there may be 

the 10.7% gender pay gap.  

5.3 We know that male employees tend to be over represented, in relation to their 

proportion of the workforce, in pay bands 8b, 8c and 9.  

5.4 It is the combination of the over representation of men in those senior pay bands 

and the lower total number of male employees that results in a higher average 
pay rate for men and, therefore, a higher gender pay gap. 

6. Recommendations

6.1 It is recommended members note the report. 

6.2 It is recommended that the data then be published as required by the Equality 

Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017.

highlighted in yellow were agreed to be closed. 

It was also agreed that the following actions can be closed: 

  Scheduling of Continuing Healthcare internal audit – scope 

of audit agreed, 

  Scoping of internal audit for the Patient Transport Service

Updates were provided regarding the open actions which included: 

  CR is to return the letter of engagement to confirm the 

contract extension for the internal audit service, 

  BG will present the Fraud Risk Assessment to the committee 

in March 2018; 

  SF has contacted various insurance brokers regarding 

insurance for cyber security attacks. AP commented that the 
insurance may also need to cover HBL ICT and their five 
other clients and therefore this will need to be reviewed as 
part of the process. 

The committee noted the updates for the action tracker. 

5. 

DEEP DIVE – DATA SECURITY 

PT provided a presentation regarding HBL ICT’s Data Security 
arrangements and a deep dive into steps taken to manage the 
cyber security threat. In summary this included an overview of the 
cyber challenges, cyber-attacks and how HBL ICT manages cyber 
security, an overview of the new data centre services, and further 
actions that can be taken to reduce the risk. 

LF queried whether risk tolerance is discussed at the HBL ICT 
Stakeholder Board. AP advised that to date Partners had required 
HBL ICT to undertake actions to reduce the risk, but had not yet set 
an agreed level of risk tolerance. The risk rating has been reduced 
as these actions have been taken, e.g. investment in infrastructure. 
As further actions may require significant additional investment, risk 
tolerance will be discussed. PL advised that the review of the risk 
register take place at each meeting where all Partners are present. 

LF commented with regards to the specialist nature of cyber 
security and whether we currently have capability and capacity 
available to ensure systems are maintained and improved. PL 
advised that there is not a high turnover with regards to this 
specialist area and there are also third party specialists who are 
called upon for assistance and advice if required. 

LF queried whether there are the correct controls with regards to 
ICT in GP practices. PL advised that GP Practices have protection 
through their N3 connections, but are not on the HBL ICT network 
so HBL ICT cannot provide the same protection as the Partners

by 

receive. HBL ICT does have a 3rd party provider supporting GP 
Practices directly and cyber security issues should be reported to 
them for support and resolution. 

LF questioned whether it is possible to benchmark against the 
cyber-attacks and what will help ensure that there is not 
complacency now that there has been investment in the 
infrastructure. PL commented that it is difficult to benchmark across 
the various attacks and there are a number of proactive exercises 
that can continue to ensure we don’t become complacent, including 
raising awareness via the Sustainability and Transformation 
Partnership, accelerating delivery of the ISO27001 programme and 
regular testing of business continuity plans. 

There was some discussion about user awareness of cyber issues 
and possible rogue email traffic. PT explained that there are plans 
to undertake an exercise to test this. The Committee asked for this 
to be reported to the Committee when complete. 

ACTION: PT to provide the Committee with confirmation once 
the user testing exercise (rogue emails) has been completed.

PT 

The committee noted Data Security overview. 

6.  QUALITY COMMITTEE

FINANCE  

Action 

by 

7.1 FINANCE RISKS UPDATE REPORT 

AP presented the finance risks update report and advised that the 
CCG is currently managing potential risks of £1.86m, previously 
£1.6m, which may impact the delivery of the CCG target financial 
position if crystallised. These include QIPP under-delivery, 
Continuing Healthcare growth in number and complexities of 
activities, patient transport service risk, prescribing risks and 
system-wide risks, which are currently mitigated by the contingency 
reserve held by the CCG. 

AP advised that there is also an additional cost pressure with 
regards to No Cheaper Stock Obtainable (NCSO) drugs which is 
impacting the prescribing budget, and that this has been reported to 
NHS England. 

The committee noted the Financial Risks update report. 

7.2 WAIVERS OF STANDING ORDERS 

AP presented the waiver form regarding the Community Pathology 
Service procurement of specialist advice. 

The committee noted the waiver of tendering procedures. 

7.3 FINAL ACCOUNTS TIMETABLE AND PROGRESS 

AP presented the Accounts Timetable and Progress and advised 
that there are no new accounting standards this year and no major 
changes to the annual report and accounts, other than a change to 
the accounts format to include Apprentice Levy. Therefore, given 
the minimal changes and a similar timetable for production of the 
Annual Report and Accounts as in previous year, the CCG is not 
expecting there to be any problems with meeting the deadlines set. 

LC suggested that it would be advisable to schedule a conference 
call prior to the submission to the Governing Body. It was agreed 
that time would be provisionally held for a conference call, should it 
be required, on 23 May 2018 at 3pm. 

The committee noted the Accounts Timetable and Progress.

SF presented the Month 9 Interim Governance Statement which 
consists of a template to notify NHS England of any known or 
emerging internal control issues by 19 January 2018 (noon).  

SF advised that this will be a nil return confirming no known 
governance or performance issues have occurred at the CCG. 

The committee noted and approved the Month 9 Interim 
Governance Statement for submission to NHS England. 

9. 

9.1 INTERNAL AUDIT PROGRESS REPORT 

CR presented the Internal Audit Progress Report which details the 
results of Internal Audit work undertaken for the year. 

The following reports 2017/18 have been finalised by the CCG 
since previous committee meeting: 

  Delivery of the Integrated Urgent Care Service (reasonable 

assurance) – with one medium and one low recommendation

CR advised that, following a discussion with AP, it is being 
proposed that the planned audit regarding the Back Office 
Functions Review is postponed this year as this would allow for the 
auditors to allocate a specific resource to the Continuing Healthcare 
Audit with regards to clinical review. 

The committee agreed the proposed change to the internal audit 
plan for 2017/18, noting that the Back Office Functions Review 
would be considered as part of the planning for next year. 

The committee noted the Internal Audit Progress Report. 

9.2 INTERIM HEAD OF INTERNAL AUDIT OPINION

IG FORUM SIX MONTHLY REPORT 

AP presented the IG Forum Six Monthly Report from the IG Forum 
for the period of July to December 2017 which highlights the 
activities that have been undertaken during this period including 
progress against the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) 
action plan and reported incidents. 

AP advised that there has been no significant change since the last 
report to the Committee and that assignment of the Data Protection 
Officer role, as required by the GDPR, is currently being reviewed. 

LF queried whether the policies approved by the IG Forum require 
an annual review as currently stated. SF advised that most policies 
have a two year review period. 

The committee noted the IG Forum Six Monthly Report and 
approved the work plan for the remainder of 2017/18.

Procedure. 

13.2 LEGAL CLAIMS REPORT 

SF presented the Legal Claims Report which outlines the 
processes and functions in place to log and manage legal cases, 
providing an overview of the current caseload. 

There are currently three open claims on the NHS Resolution 
Claims Management System for the CCG; it was clarified that the 
figure reported for the third listed claim is the total cost with East 
and North Herts NHS Trust and therefore the CCG’s contribution is 
only half of this figure. 

The committee queried the timeframe in which a claim can be 
made, SF and AP confirmed that the basic rule is three years from 
the date of injury but it can be longer in certain circumstances such 
as where the patient is a child, has a mental disorder or there is an 
interval before the patient realised they had suffered significant 
injury possibly related to treatment. 

SF advised that the Continuing Healthcare claims listed in table 7.3 
are from the outcomes of the redress panel. 

The committee noted the Legal Claims Report.

SERVICE CHARGES 2018-19  (document provided)

5.1  Service Charges
PT explained the document provided detailing new costs & service 
charges for HBL partner organisations for 2018/19.  All charges broken 
down.  Inflation = 2.1% but some offset through planned IT efficiency 
savings (1.5%)  

New Service Charges for 2018/19 – PT explained the breakdown: HPFT 
& HCT would have additional licencing costs; New telephone system;  
Cloud based SharePoint solution; Mobile device manager - Airwatch 
licence;  Replace edge switches for 122 sites (price based on 5 year 
depreciation).   Proposed new service charges for 2018/19 = £9.1 m 

PT asked the board for their comments.  
Airwatch & depreciation are the main increased costs for HCT & HPFT.   
PT clarified SMS ServiceNow & IPT costs.  KC does not want to see an 
increase in costs & ask for capital depreciation over 7/10 years.  
Efficiency saving 1.5% is a starting point & not based on any benchmark. 

PT/AP explained MS EA and clarified the Datacentre costs:  
1) MS EA - Each organisation purchases MS licences for their own end 
users under the MS Enterprise Agreement (subscription based). 
2)  Datacentre – PT stated that all infrastructure costs have been 
absolved & it has also eliminate OT/ weekend working.   

HCT plan to supply Airwatch with every mobile (these are included in 
HCT £23K charge).  PT stated we negotiated a better price (£70K 
reduction) by buying Airwatch licences upfront.  KC stated to keep costs 

Page 3 of 8

Action 

by 

same as this year.  Regarding the replacement of edge switches, the 
group would like the capital depreciation spread over 7/10 years (not 
5years) if NHSE would agree to this.  HBL is the bulk user of the 
licences. 

SC/PT will try to: reduce the Airwatch costs £70K even further; review all 
licences; look at domain separation; look at telephone re-approportioned 
costs. 

PT 

It was agree that the QM’s should be reviewed on an annual basis 
including service charges to the partners.  If a partner was to lose 
business/contracts, then they would consume less services from HBL 
ICT, therefore HBL would reduce services/staff/ sites etc. There is a need 
to capture significant changes of business i.e ongoing trend but not 
seeing this at present.   
HPFT will need to review these service charges and HCT will have to 
justify the £2.6m to its board. 
PT stated that ICT vacancies not filled this year and the work & costs 
absorbed.  
JB thinks we need to have a discussion on re-focussing on our 
investment – MS licences, asset management & joint objectives etc.  PT 
stated that compared to last year, the infrastructure is now stronger with 
the new datacentre up & running. RA agreed and wants to see a 
difference in 6 months; will also take on board the need to re-educate 
staff on password resets & assets.  PT mentioned the difficulty of keeping 
accurate asset (i.e. laptops) numbers, listing a number of reasons i.e. 
such as leaver information is not forwarded. RA asked if we have a 
record of assets patched.  PT stated that any asset on the network is 
patched.       

BA – asked if we are investing enough in IT?  Is 2.2% high enough – 
hence the request to re-focus our investment. SC stated SharePoint is 
provided for all to use (pay per user)  – some unaware they have it 
(Luton).   

PT asked if group were in agreement with costs/charges presented. 
KC in principle & depreciation OK.  How are we benchmarking this & is 
this the right sort of price members should be paying?  HBL will always 
make saving and share them where possible.  

It was agreed that the revised charges will be presented to the Board in 
January for approval and sign-off. 

6.  MICROSOFT LICENCING – Partnership Enterprise Agreement 

PT presented the renewal options available.  We currently have a 3 year 
EA across the partners.  PT clarified that £110K ca. is price HCT will pay 

Page 4 of 8

Item  Subject

by 

for the right to use MS licences (Core Cal & Windows10).  Once licences 
deployed, you are committed to the new charges. 
For clarification of licensing programs: MS Enterprise Agreement is 
subscription based; MS MPSA (Microsoft Products and Services 
Agreement) is owned.   
2 main elements to licences:  1) End user devices; 2) CAL (client access 
licences) gives you the right to link your devices to HBL 
infrastructure/servers. 

Current EA due for renew in April 2018 - full price stated here £761.5K.  
(MS validation of our state takes place in June 18).  Central discussions 
nationally are in progress between DoH & MS to negotiate prices on 
behalf of the whole of the NHS & the public services sector.  NHS 
England own all licences for GPs.  For Trusts & remaining NHS 
establishments, the Wannacry virus attack in May 2017 highlighted the 
fact that people were not patching equipment; as well as still using old 
legacy operating systems.  Unclear at present if these discussions would 
lead to central funding or just an improved price.   
As an alternative to this, we can hire (£15K) 3rd party to come in & look at 
how we use licences & to optimise all the things we own & use.   
At present we action 100 patches per week on Windows7 but only 4 on 
Windows10.   
Licences used to be linked to devices but current structure now is ‘user’ 
based, which is a better option (for using laptop, iPad, iPhone etc.).  
Leavers’ licences can be re-cycled & used again.  PT highlighted that fact 
that HBL must be notified of leavers otherwise the AD list is not accurate. 
Known leavers still on the AD list are disabled (in-active).    Partners are 
not very good advising us of leavers therefore this reflects the true 
number of active users & devices and affects costs. Next true up is in 
July.  Bank staff are sometimes left on as they return intermittently.  PT 
confirmed that the device count does not incl. smart phones (because 
they don’t have Windows 10).   
Recommendation is to stall and not commit to MS yet.  We must act by 
April 2018.  In the interim, bring in 3rd party as previously stated.  If 
nothing happens nationally, upgrade where Win7 licences are needed 
(30/40K) to 2019.  Win7 is only supported til 2020.   
PT to pursue the hire of 3rd party to come in & look at how we use 
licences & to optimise all the things we own & use.   
Important that we make sure that the user base is correct.  Do we have 
more devices than necessary?  This depends on each organisation, 
which is the best way to do it (users or devices).  A user can have up to 5 
devices.

SERVICE PERFORMANCE  November 2017  (documents provided) 

7.1 Service Statement.   PT briefly explained the Service Statement 
dated 18/12/17. 
SD performance in November 2017 was slightly better than previous 
months.  Systems Operations team worked on all ‘aged’ requests – about 
400 - & these have now been cleared down to zero.  Duty Manager post 
is working well.  Datacentre working well and no major fall out.  HBL have 
introduced a new way to ‘patch’ things, which reduces the network traffic 
and backlogs.  Risk Register section highlights a new risk – failed tape 
backup in the legacy Exchange environment.  A new service will be 
delivered through the 2 datacentres.  Will be put out to tender.  Paper to 
be presented to board outlining savings.

Service Desk has stabilised a lot more but still needs to be looked at.  
ICT re-structure in progress in order to reduce costs.  Weekend period is 
costly – 2 resources & we struggle with shift working; also struggle with 
the retention of 2nd line people.  Consultation period to take place 
Jan/Feb 2018.  

7.2 HBL KPIs  First Contact Resolution target rate at 54% was 
highlighted as a deterioration compared to Nov.16.  PT stated that 1st line 
need to be skilled up as some issues not being fixed on first call.  
However, types of calls need to be re-classified to get a true picture.  
ServiceNow tool now available to make such changes – reports can then 
be printed. 

7.3  GPIT KPIs  Volume of calls received really low.  Performance overall 
is good. 

8 

HBL ICT Risk Register (documents provided) 

Tape backups have been a problem in the last month partly due to the 
size of databases within the Exchange environment & mainly around 
HPFT.  Some databases need re-building as remedial work (tape 
backups will happen in next 2 months).  PT stated that group will be 
coming off Exchange.  
P5 – 2.2 New Risks – 1.  Question raised re: current risk grade 5x5 .  PT 
explained that backups fail on a regular basis & is more an issue on old 
Exchange environment.  5x5 is probably overstating the risk.  This risk is 
specifically relevant in HPFT & it was asked how could HPFT mitigate 
this.  HBL to ensure risks are accurate and reflect the true grade of risks 
for all.

CYBER SECURITY (document provided) 

Cyber Report – not real changes; no cyber events.  Open items do not 
appear to have moved, a few new ones added.  P6 - we should be 
concerned that 187 mobile devices mentioned have no software upgrade 
& therefore possibly compromising any confidential information contained 
thereon.  However, devices are protected/controlled via Mobile Device 
Manager software and can be isolated from the network if necessary.  
CCGs & partner organisations should be notified if employees do not 
upgrade devices’ software when notified to do so.  Some phones are too 
old to accept upgrades and therefore need replacing. 
SC to investigate the situation behind the 187 devices not upgraded.

PROJECT REPORTS (documents provided)

10.1 – DataCentre Migration.  Proposed project closure 31/12/17.  ARK is 
up and running and it provides services.  Exchange still in old Bedford 
datacentre; Comms Room in Charter still in throws of re-vamp (ready end 
Jan 18).  Project close date to be amended – PT.

10.3 – NHSmail2 Migration.  We have had some challenges with 
Accenture and have lost time on some issues i.e. removal of specific 
characters in AD.  HBL will produce some further reports this week.  
Accenture due to come in end January 2018 although we hope to bring 
this forward to beg./mid January 2018.  Plan is still for them to commence 
migration with E&NH CCG followed by the other CCGs and then 
HCT/HPFT. 
Concerns around the impact this work will have on the network.  
Accenture say to expect a massive increase in SD calls.  However, our 
approach would be to do stagger the migration & do in groups i.e.  a – f,  
g - m etc.  This would mitigate the disruption.  The work is estimated to 
take 6 weeks. 

HCT stated that they mainly use NHSmail (web based) and do not want 
to use MS Outlook.  HBL can disable Outlook if necessary & re-instate in 
groups.  However, saturating the network is not ideal.  Problems may 
occur with smaller bandwidth on the network.   

Massive mail boxes already migrated although we still did not cull as 
much as we could have done.  Cost of mailbox migration – up to 4GB is 
free; anything over is chargeable.  There are still some very large 
mailboxes to be migrated.  A mailbox size will be your current Email size 
+ archive combined.  HCT plan to migrate all mailboxes within the first 3 

Page 7 of 8

Item  Subject 

months of go-live.  After that, HCT will turn off access to the archive 
mailbox with the instruction to copy across to their live mailbox. Warnings 
will be automatically be triggered the nearer you get to 4GB.  If mailbox 
goes above the limit, emails are automatically frozen.  Accenture has 
given everyone a live mailbox (pre-requisite).

ANY OTHER BUSINESS 
PT stated that the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the HBL ICT 
Stakeholder Board will be reviewed in January 2018.  He also suggested 
the current monthly meetings be changed to quarterly meetings (4 per 
annum).  Meetings were cancelled in the past because no quorum. AP 
stated that we should be able to plan better and put day to day work to

Patching Strategy   

•  PT intends to present a paper to the board in April 18 re: capital for upgrading 

servers & new operating system. 

•  Changing back-up solution in February 18 from tape to disk (which gives more 

control & is quicker) 

•  Upgrade SSCM 
•  New automated tool will reduce patching costs currently approx. £100K p.a. 
•  Maintenance window to be scheduled in for year 

KF explained volume of patches used and time taken to re-boot servers.  BIs a 
challenge. A window is required to do these patches so all systems incl. running 
background systems need to be considered. 
Action: Agree a period every month where we can apply patches to BI environment.

SERVICE CHARGES 2018-19  (document provided) 
The proposed Service Charges 2018/19 have been reviewed and updated:   
1) increased efficiency contribution from 1.5% to 2.3%.   
2) changed depreciation on Edge Switches from 5 to 7 years.   
Will need a contribution of £85K from partners for new services listed as well as a 
further £400K, which we will need to find.  KC wanted to know what schemes are in 
place to make £400K savings and how would they be delivered.  ICT re-structure will 
absorb some of these costs, which will be detailed in due course.  PT asked for 
partners’ signatures at this meeting. 

Alan Davies (via Liz Cox) stated that he is not happy with the increase in service 
charges.  MS SharePoint appeared an issue as although Luton pays for this, no one 
knows of its existence.  Request for costs 12 months ago not forthcoming.  PT offered 
assistance & will review & agree Luton’s charges.  SharePoint is a fixed cost.   

Service Charges were signed off by E&NH CCG, HCT, Beds CCG members on 15th
January 2018 at the meeting.  HPFT & Luton CCG signed on 16th January 2018.  
HVCCG signed …??….. or still outstanding.   ###

PATIENT  Wi-Fi  PROPOSAL  (document provided)
PT explained the purpose of this proposed service and the intended supplier ‘Block 
Solutions Ltd’, who has quoted a fixed price based on what we need.  Work would 
take 12 weeks to complete.  However, members felt this should go out to tender to 
compare costs.  This will extend the installation of the service but PT will action the 
request for HBL procurement to source other suppliers.  AP urged caution and the 
need to seek value for money.  There is no Wi-Fi in Beds sites.  Guest Wi-Fi is needed 
more than patient Wi-Fi.
Group happy for this proposal to go out to tender and to give Block Solutions Ltd the 
option to re-bid.  JB asked for option to be based on charges per access point (AP) – 
numbers can vary.  Commodity based. 

SERVICE PERFORMANCE  December  2017  (documents provided) 
PT stated that performance for December was good overall although there had been 
challenges with staffing levels (weather conditions/VPN at beg. December).  Duty 
Manager post is working well; escalations drastically reduced.  This post will be 
reviewed end January 2018 with the intention to keep it going.  HPFT stated that the 
backlog of laptops had gone away & this had really made a difference; issues with 
‘phones would be their next target area. 
ICT/HBL in discussion with HR re: re-design of customer services.  There is now a 
better calibre of 2nd line staff & the re-structure will also help.  Good overall. 
7.2 Dashboard figures for estimated ASAs and calls abandoned for Nov/Dec clarified.  
KC asked if we should see an improvement of responses & fixes by April.  Re-
structure to improve services and reduce costs will be measured by the resolution of 
incidents.  PT will report progress to members.

Various suggestions put forward to resolve incidents and to maintain the quality of the 
service.  Industry standards usually go with automated answers i.e. request issues are 
online; faults are reported by ‘phone – problem can then be discussed with owner & 
resolved.  Still receive a lot of calls for NHSmail password re-sets although domain 
requests have been less.  NHSmail users can re-set their own passwords but the site 
is not that user friendly.   

ICT Technical team will focus on three areas - problem management, project delivery 
& innovation.   Need to ensure that 3rd line do not get involved with 2nd line work.  In 
order to save another £400K 2018/19, we need to target these resources at the right 
issues & ensure it is carried out correctly.  Out of hours will be carried out by 1st line in 
future and therefore cheaper to run.  The re-structure is definitely about saving money 
& re-sizing customer services; new technology also allows us to do things differently & 
incur savings (i.e. removes manual tasks & travelling time).  

HBL ICT Risk Register (documents provided) 
Little has changed since Nov.17.  Risks have reduced significantly (now only 5 high 
level).  PT explained that risks marked ‘previous’ are risks as they were initially 
assessed i.e. original level of risk.  Customer awareness and cyber security of the 
infrastructure have also helped to reduce previous risks. 
If central funding is negotiated nationally we could upgrade to EA, which will mean we 
will be fully licenced.  Unknown at present. 
However, we need to enter into a licence agreement which will cost more than this 
year.  Risk to HBL is negligible & financial risk is small.  PT stated there is a risk to 
HBL if we cannot purchase Windows10 & if we cannot upgrade operating systems 
(would revert to patching).    
PT explained risk grade 3x3.  

CYBER SECURITY  Monthly Report (document provided) 
KF confirmed a drop in spam emails (incoming), which indicates that the national 
database is recognising the different reputations of spam.  However, patching is still 
heavy – 69 application updates across servers in Dec 17 – to deal with issues on older 
software.   Open threats remain -  ID agent rolled out but was not compatible with ESR 
so it was pulled back.  Hope to restart this soon. 
NHS Digital informs us every month & lists the main possible threats, which we keep 
on change control.   
HBL ICT received the Cyber Essentials Certificate (basic) last year and will pursue the 
‘plus’ certificate in 2018.   

HBL ICT constantly sends out warnings for staff to be vigilant at all times & to report 
any suspicious incoming email activity/attachments/URLs.   
PT suggested that the group consider a trial email exercise from an outside source, 
which when received would highlight those who click on or open an attachment 
without careful consideration, giving us the benefit of insight into the problem & 
feedback of risk.  However, this must also give the receiver of the email immediate 
feedback & make them aware of their actions, as well as the potential harm they might

Possibility to replace existing software ‘Barracuda’ with a product called ‘Umbrella’, 
which looks at URLs contained in emails & also checks for trusted domains.  This 
would provide a greater level of security.  PT will obtain a quote for ‘Umbrella’ product. 

NHS publicises directors’ names so easy for fraudster to obtain information.  Problem 
is ‘clicking on the link’ as well as untrustworthy display names.  PT to create & send 
out a ‘spoof’ standard email from an external organisation to see who responds.   
Also to discuss at ICT Strategy Steering group meeting.

10  PROJECT REPORTS (documents provided)

10.1 – DataCentre Migration & PABX Refurbishment.  Date agreed for downtime at 
sites on weekends. 
10.2 – BLMK HSCN Procurement.  Finalising our requirement statement for suppliers 
on the framework (to incl. BT & VirginMedia) to go out end January 2018.  AP would 
prefer a wider supplier base in tender process. 
10.3 – NHSmail2 Migration.  Documentation submitted to Accenture was returned to 
us with errors highlighted notably HPFT with 1215 errors.  Problem mainly caused by 
new starters with previous NHS mail accounts elsewhere – all these accounts need to 
be cleared before Accenture can build our new environment & will not commence until 
this is done.  Once cleared, Accenture will start a 3 week pilot as the impact, when 
profiles are downloaded, needs to be understood.  HBL ICT teams are working 
through these errors.   

PT confirmed to KC - pilot in March and start migration in for HCT & HPFT in April 
2018.  KF explained that there is the need to tidy up ‘leavers’ in HCT (616).  Their 
previous NHS organisations need to mark the accounts as leavers on their system, so 
that they can be transferred to HCT and actioned.  Basically, NHSmail accounts not 
registered within our organisation cannot be considered for migration.  Old NHSmail 
accounts/information from a previous organisation no longer belongs to the leaver & 
should stay with the old organisation.  A new NHSmail account will be created by each 
organisation as you move jobs.  

KF will investigate the ‘N3 User community’ to ascertain if this can be used as a 
central unit/hub of OA account managers to contact.   

KF 

PT stated that we are 1) changing email service to a national one  2) push out 
messaging for business clients.  NHSnet’s Skype for business works with current 
NHSnet accounts (video is extra).   

From an IG perspective, taking a NHSmail email account when leaving an 
organisation cannot be allowed and some controls need to be put in place to monitor 
this.  Partners can decide what happens to their data & how they handle it (i.e. what is 
used by local doctors);  ICT can offer advice and/or recommendations about this.  
PT is committed to resolve errors which need to be cleared by end January 2018.

Also, HBL is not archiving anymore so it’s growing at a massive rate (130% in Dec 
17).  Will extra large mailboxes now become a problem?   Database is now massive.

MDM – MobileIron - did have issues with Android ‘phones and Sophos – reverted to a

for Sophos to create new licence. 

11  STAKEHOLDER BOARD – Terms of Reference  (document provided) 

Although the Stakeholder Board meetings have been held on a monthly basis, Phil 
Turnock suggested to members that these meetings would be better held quarterly.    
HBL ICT can update the trusts of any risks and/or significant changes; ICT attend the 
HCT & HPFT  IT forums.  ICT reports will still be sent out monthly to all members.  
Quarterly meeting will be extended to 2.5 hrs duration.  Primary Care will also be 
included. 

The current Terms of Reference (ToR) does state that meetings are held quarterly and 
this will now be the case.  ToR were therefore agreed by the board & will be validated 
but there is no change to the document. 

PT confirmed that the ICT Strategy Steering Group is mainly attended by HCT, HPFT 
& HVCCG and held 2nd Monday of the month.  Luton & Beds CCG to be added to 
diary invitation. SH

12  ANY OTHER BUSINESS   

ICT Strategy Steering Group - needs a proper list of programmes required for next

which created some problems.

QUALITY REPORT

QUALITY/SAFETY 

The Quality Report was circulated in advance of the meeting. 

The paper was presented as read and further discussion elicited 
that: 

1.  3 practices have moved to a more positive position and 
support by all partners and a willingness to engage by 
the practices was acknowledged. 

2.  2 practices (Sollershott and Stockwell Lodge) are 

inadequate and the report outlines the support required.  

4 | P a g e

3.  3 practices require improvement and one of them has 

had a draft rating of good (Church Street). 

4.  The Friends and Family Test has received an increase in 

responses and informs good practice to be shared. 

5.  The Annual GP Survey has been published and the 
colour rating informs targeted strategies – Stockwell 
Lodge was rated poor across the board.  

6.  Quality Visits continue to provide practices with support. 
The Memorandum of Understanding between NHSE and 
the CCG has been strengthened. There has been 
engagement made with the National Association of 
Patient Participation (NAPP). 

7.  Stanhope Surgery was not visited however a lighter 

touch support has been in place. 

8.  It was acknowledged that Healthwatch Reports are 

informative and thorough. 

The Joint Co-Commissioning Committee noted the actions 
being taken to support practices which continue to be monitored 
by ENHCCG. 

The Joint Co-Commissioning Committee agreed that NHSE and 
ENHCCG continue working jointly to agree quality priorities. 

CONTRACTS UPDATE

OPERATIONAL 

6. 

The NHSE Contract Update which was circulated in advance of 
the meeting was presented as read and further discussion 
elicited that: 

1.  The Limes - the practice partners gave 6 months’ notice 

on their contract together with an application to close 
their list until the end of the contract. This was further 
discussed at the extraordinary JCC on 1st September 
whereby it was agreed that procurement of a 5 year 
APMS Contract was the preferred option in order to 
maintain the required primary care capacity & premises 
in the town. The closing date for bids is 13.10.17 after 
which the evaluation and moderation process 
commences. The contract will be in place 01.02.18. 

2.  The contractual merger for Dolphin House/Maltings 

Surgery was formally approved on 01.10.17. 

3.  Partial closures were outlined as detailed in the report 
and it was noted that patients are being assigned when 
required. New patients will be accepted.  

5 | P a g e

STP UPDATE – PRIMARY AND COMMUNITY CARE WORK 
STREAM 

Clare Hawkins and Marion Dunstone from HCT arrived at 
10.17am

The presentation on Place Based Care (PBC) was presented 
including: 

1.  Elements of the PBC framework include engaged 

communities, local primary care models, integrated 
neighbourhood teams, single plan of care, care 
coordination, access to specialist advice and social 
prescribing.  

6 | P a g e

2.  Local initiatives include – established locality forums with 
statutory and non-statutory organisations including social 
care, aligned leaders from key agencies, CCG 
transformation managers, CCG GP lead, senior manager 
and executive, localities event, each locality determining 
priorities, developing relationships and leadership, 
sharing of good practice, Stort and Lower Lea Valley 
have joined the NAPC network. 

3.  Examples of good practice in the locality were outlined 

D Boardman arrived at 10.26am

4.  Place based care STP work stream priorities were 

explained including the macro, meso and micro levels. 

5.  The way forward is to focus on capacity and capability to 
effect change, agreed outcomes, delivering impact with 
one agenda that everyone is working towards 
commissioning and applying the learning from the 
mapping work. 

6.  Colleagues agreed that alignment and avoiding 

duplication is key to success. RC agreed to have further 
discussions with MD regarding workforce and education. 

7.  NS highlighted the requirement for links with the Acute 
Trust’s capacity concerns and community support was 
discussed. In some localities, there are multiple Acute 
Trusts in different STPs to work with which leads to 
inconsistencies. 

8.  NW commented that localities are not all currently 

working at the same level as each other – they have 
different levels of support etc and it is important to realise 
that some practices are struggling. This influences place 
based care and impacts on primary care delivery and 
vice versa. It is recognised that there are costs to be 
considered when delivering additional services in the 
community. 

9.  The priorities and aligning of strategies in the STP work 

streams were considered and it was noted that improving 
the health and wellbeing of the community will lead to 
fewer admissions and impact on social care. Some 
services delivered locally will have local ownership 
however some services will be centralised. 

10. The additional costs of duplication in smaller 
geographical areas was noted and how the 
disadvantages would be overcome were challenged. 

7 | P a g e

11. An explanation of how priorities in one locality were 

agreed and how they fit in with key performance 
indicators in the STP was given. The finances and 
impact on activity were discussed in line with community 
needs and the requirement for service level agreements. 
Zaid Ismail and Martina Vogel-Matthews arrived at 
10.41am

12. It was acknowledged that partnerships and stakeholder 

involvement for longer periods of time can be 
challenging. A focus on what is key for the population 
and where the biggest impact can be made is needed. 
AP stressed the importance of local ownership and 
integration, although some services will always be 
delivered centrally. This will take time and effort and 
there will be challenges along the way.   

13. HB reminded group of the importance of work on UTIs 
and pathways. Most acute trusts are in deficit and need 
activity to get income. We need to look at quality of care 
issues to avoid unnecessary pneumonia and UTI 
admissions.   

14. ACTION: Presentation to be made available to 

Healthwatch and other interested groups such as 
Patient Participation Groups.

MD/EP 

15. The presenters were thanked for the clarity in the 

presentation. 

The Joint Co-Commissioning Committee noted the report.

GP FORWARD VIEW – Part A

STRATEGY/POLICY 

9. 

The presentation was delivered including: 

Extended Access 

1.  The CCG is mandated to deliver a regional target around 
extended access- ENHCCG are part of Central Midlands. 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 were outlined. The extended 
access offer is underpinned by 7 requirements which are 
in place in the CCG. The target is currently set for 50% of 
the CCG’s population to offer extended access by 
2018/19 and for 100% of the population to have access 
to extended access by April 2019. West Essex CCG is 
already offering 100% extended access as they were a 
pilot site.   

2.  Federation working is actively in place and locality 

8 | P a g e

feedback is positive regarding providing extended access 
services. The CCG wants to support federation and 
collaborative working rather than going out to the market 
and localities are in agreeance with this.  North Herts 
have gone out to the public and asked them what they 
want extended access in the area to look like and will 
see if this is deliverable. 

3.  The technical challenges were acknowledged and it was 
noted that a dedicated team is working to progress this. 

CCG £1.50 transformation non-recurrent monies 

4.  This is being utilised to achieve agreed objectives and for 

localities to think about transformation. 

5.  Examples of strategies introduced in localities were 

explained including: silicon footfall, training, developing 
integrated workforce strategies, leadership courses, 
remote booking, extended access, locality business 
management support and clinical roles. 

6.  NHSE funding is awaited for the rollout of online 

consultations across the entire CCG, however data 
collection across practices on any individual current use 
of online consultation technology has been undertaken. 

Workflow Optimisation 

7.  This is part of the GP Forward View 10 high impact 

actions. All practices in ENHCCG will have gone through 
training by January 2018.  

8.  Workflow optimisation feedback has been considered 

and how the work has been redistributed across the 
practice. 

Active Signposting (Care Navigation) 

9.  This is the initial signposting for patients and connects 

with the STP Social Prescribing Offer. 

10. A communication is expected this week. 

Medical Assistants  

11. The role of medical assistants requires further clarity 

from NHSE before we commit money to it.   

12. A GPFV event took place at Herts Valleys recently where   

Medical Assistants in practice meant a GP and trained 
admin doing Skype consultations together. 

13. JG commented that in some parts of county voluntary 

9 | P a g e

sector and PPGs are being used to help signpost in GP 
practices.   

The Joint Co-Commissioning Committee noted the report. 

10.  

GP FORWARD VIEW – PART B

The Technology / Digital Roadmap paper was circulated in 
advance of the meeting. 

ZI talked the paper through, some of the key points highlighted 
were: 

1.  Some practices have implemented IT strategies of their 

own which is not universal across the CCG at this stage.  
Colleagues acknowledged that the ground-breaking work 
being undertaken by the CCG is significant and the 
initiatives of reworking the algorithms and addressing risk 
factors is an exciting development. 

2.  Colleagues discussed in detail the unique developments 

which have been made to support the CCG in fully 
understanding the population within the MedeAnlaytics 
platform using a variety of sources of data including 
Population Health Segmentation. An example of this is 
looking at the needs of a group of frail patients and 
children with LTCs and working out the population in the 
locality.  ZI wants to establish ENHCCG as a data first 
CCG - all of the planning, commissioning and monitoring 
decisions should be driven by data.   

3.  The facilitation and promotion of self-care and self-
management which involves a variety of local and 
national programmes was considered. The lack of 
patients engaging was acknowledged as a possible risk.  

4.  JG highlighted that it is important to note that some of the 

work that ENHCCG is doing has not been done before 
elsewhere. 

5.  DD asked about use of technology to enable self-care 
and self-management.  There are lots of programmes 
locally and nationally – there is a huge difference 
between patients who are enabled to make appointments 
on line – DD believe that - there is a risk that patients will 
miss out if they do not enrol on line and have access to 
their records. It is also important to have these records 
available to all professionals in the home of the patient. 

6.  It was recommended that a target is set locally regarding 
accessing patient records. NW highlighted that this was a 
lot of work for practices and isn’t a priority at the moment 
however should be in practices work plan.  Extended 

10 | P a g e

access is more of a priority.  

7.  PG stated that eventually patients could become 

custodians of their own records.  Extended access/out of 
hours do not have access to these records - vulnerable 
patients should have an iPad in their home with records 
available for healthcare professionals to have access to 
– as has been achieved in parts of Kent and London. 

8.  ACTION: The management ownership of My Care 

Record Programme is to be clarified. 

9.  ACTION: IT Steering Group to further discuss priority 

of the various programme work streams and 
consider the value of setting additional local targets. 

10. Action: Clear definition of online consultation 

needed.  

11. It was noted that HUC has signed up to the ‘My Care 
Record’ programme and should be referred to in the 
report if other organisations are referred to. 

12. NS informed the group that Princess Alexandra Harlow 

(PAH) cannot access records of his patients. JG will 
raise this. NS also highlighted that getting patients to 
access records is a significant piece of work for GPs but 
that they are happy to implement this over time.

NHSE PRIMARY CARE BUDGET 2017-18 

The Financial Report for Primary Medical Services (Month 5 
2017/8) was circulated in advance of the meeting. 

11 | P a g e

The paper was presented and further discussion elicited that: 

1.  The position is reported as a small underspend versus 

the year-to-date budget. The following should be noted: - 
Contingency is phased in twelfths; The 0.5% Non-
Recurrent Reserve is phased in Month 12; The 0.5% 
Systems Resilience Reserve is phased in Month 12;  

• The negative budget and positive spend line on 

Trainees/Pensions/Levies require further clarification 

• The Budgets without spend e.g. parental leave costs 
were reviewed and a response is required on whether 
there are any costs being incurred or they are 
captured in the lines above  

• The non-recurrent spend (345) and Other (1058) and 

JCOG Agree Programmes (665) = £2m.  £600k for 
the primary care winter capacity has not yet been 
transferred resulting in £1.4m of current headroom. A 
response is required on the process and discussion 
to utilise this in the current year. 

2.  ACTION: A further discussion will take place 

between AP and DC to clarify the above, the outcome 
of which will be shared at the upcoming NHSE-CCG 
Assurance meeting. 

DC, AP 

The Joint Co-Commissioning Committee noted the report 

12. 

NEW RISKS IDENTIFIED

1.  There is a risk that the self-care and self-management 

objective will not be achieved and patients will not benefit 
from investment in Primary Care if there is a failure to 
enable patient access to patient care records.

Quality Report 

Paper taken as read. CS fed back that all practices have been inspected 
under the CQC programme and two practices are still rated as inadequate. 
A fairly significant amount of work has been put in the assist these 
practices. Stockwell Lodge required a lot of support on a variety of CQC 
issues and were re-inspected on 18 January - verbal feedback from CQC 
is that the inspection went ‘ok’. A report is due on 2 February. The practice 
has engaged well with Healthwatch and work is ongoing. 

Two practices rated as requires improvement: 

• Abbey Road which was re-inspected in January 2018, verbal 

feedback is that it went well. A report is due on 2 February. 

• Stanhope Surgery remains as ‘requires improvement’, CQC are 
due to visit in the Spring. The CCG/NHSE have offered help but 
the surgery has confirmed that they have a robust action plan and 
tight grip on what they need to do. 

An event was held recently with upwards of 60 representatives from 
practices across all localities. The event involved short snappy 
presentations and feedback following this will be used for future events to 
guide topics that practices would like to look at in more detail – e.g 
preparing for inspections. The Quality team are looking at developing a 
website so that presentations and templates can be added for all practices 
to see. The LMC have been involved. The Quality team want to ensure 

Page 3 of 11

Item  Subject 

Action 

by 

that practices know that they are here to help - e.g offering practical help 
around infection control etc. 

DD praised the team on the success of the event and highlighted the 
importance of communicating good news to all practices.  

MT passed on that he had heard that the event was a splendid day and 
asked if it could be an annual event? 

CS advised that they are looking at the possibility of holding this on a 
quarterly basis if capacity and demand allow, however this is in the early 
stages of discussions.  

RC informed the group that from an education and CPD point of view, 
some practice nurse tutors have found it hard to get their practices to 
engage but things are changing for the better and more engagement is 
taking place. 

ENHCCG and NHSE have recently worked together extensively on quality 
issues and YTA congratulated both teams on their hard work.  

The Committee noted the paper 

6. 

Contracts Update 

CG introduced the paper and took it as read and highlighted that this is the 
public part of the JCC and therefore further in depth conversation will be 
taking part in Part 2. 

The Limes APMS contract is going very well. There were originally two 
bidders for the role and Lea Valley Health was successful in securing the 
contract. CG is impressed with the federation and how they’ve mobilised 
this contract, it will take some time for the new provider to embed within 
the locality but there are lots of positives to take from this procurement. 

A recent market engagement event took place for the Sollershott 
procurement – two providers attended.  

Further contractual discussions to take place in the part 2 meeting. 

Nabeil Shukur arrived at 10:27am

NHSE Primary Care Budget 2017-18 – month 9 

Action 

by 

CG presented paper that outlined current NHSE primary care finance 
position. Noted that any technical questions will have to go back to the 
report author Stephen Makin. The report shows an underspend and the 
paper offers clearly articulated information about how the reserve is 
phased into accounts which appears quite positive from a primary care 
spend.  

AP commented that there are a number of lines where there is a budget 
but no spend for the year to date, however there is a note stating that this 
budget will be spent by year end – AP raised concerns around spend on 
premises developments actually materialising. There is a forecast 
underspend of £1.2 million which suggests that this is good news looking 
forward as ENHCCG will have some flexibility in delegation. £600k of 
investment has already been received. When the CCG takes on delegated 
functions we should be clear on what the underlying financial 
commitments are going forward then we can take forward decisions as a 
CCG on what we do. 

LF highlighted that under ‘reserves and contingency’ £1 million is listed as 
being underspent. 

AP responded that this was originally called Central Midlands Resilience 
Fund. It is an unallocated reserve but Central Midlands needs to balance 
its books across all of primary care, with the CCG moving to delegated 
commissioning, we would only be required to balance our books, not the 
books of others.  

LF commented that the CCGs running costs are already a third 
underspent, can some of the underspend be used to pay for extra 
staffing?  

AP highlighted that the underspend is for programme costs which cannot 
be used to fund running costs. As a CCG we are funding some items that 
are running costs with programme costs, however it can be argued that 
this is a legitimate charge to the primary care programme costs. Once the 
CCG moves to delegated commissioning we will be able to spend more on 
primary care if we choose to, it will be under our control.  

AP informed the JCC that in terms of delegation there are already 
discussions between the CCG and NHSE taking place during this 
transition period which will continue.  

DC queried whether there was anything else that needs to be done to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible?  

AP highlighted that the biggest issue is that of staffing. We need to really 
understand how to we create clarity for the people doing the work so they 

Page 5 of 11

Item  Subject 

can actually do it. 

Action 

by 

BF commented that there needs to be something a bit more formal 
between CCG and NHSE as staffing is very important, another issue is 
understanding the wider NHSE work, e.g the specialist advice around 
procurement and where that sits when we move to delegated 
commissioning. We need to ensure that we can access the specialist 
support where needed.  

HB agreed that there needs to be particular support around procurement 
and that we need some clarity here – costs are not fully understood.  

Action: It was agreed that staffing discussions will continued outside 
of the JCC meeting between BF and DC. 

The Committee noted the paper. 

8.  

Extended Access / Shared Clinical Record 

DB presented the paper and took it as read. To support this work stream 
NHSE have created an Extended Access delivery programme which has 
rated ENHCCG’s plan green, NHSE require monthly updates. 

A workshop is being held on 31 January for half a day with representatives 
from federations and NHSE to talk about progress to date around 
Extended Access. The work with Welwyn Hatfield has a go live date of 19 
March 2018 and work has already started with Stevenage. There is 
keenness from the centre for 2018-19 trajectory to be bought forward to 
potentially Q3 of 18-19 this year.  The project is on target and moving 
forward.  

JG highlighted that this has not been without its challenges. There has 
been some moving of goal posts from the centre which has made it a 
challenge but this has been worked through. Technology has been a real 
success story. Compared to where we were 3 months ago where there 
was a lot of nervousness around sharing records, particularly due to 
GDPR, this has moved forward a lot.  Practices themselves have 
commented on what a good piece of collaborative work this has been. 

LF extended her congratulations on this piece of work. Particularly the 
work around EMIS practices. Stevenage is all on SystmOne and therefore 
this should make joint working more straightforward.  

DB commented that the top slicing of the £1.50 monies has been crucial in 
funding ICT work.  

DD queried inequalities across localities around patients ability to access 

Page 6 of 11

Item  Subject 

Action 

by 

their clinical records and the support provided by the CCG to ensure 
patients can easily access these – it was felt that sometimes there is a 
disconnect between what is being said nationally and what is happening 
locally.  DD queried how the CCG is monitoring patient uptake of 
accessing records online and queried how we are working to increase this 
number.  

NW stressed that there is significant work for practices to do in making 
online records accessible to patients and that there are many other 
priorities that take practices time.  

DB responded that Welwyn Hatfield is slightly different due to the Spring 
House procurement - the communications team at the CCG are working 
with the public to help look at workforce, e.g are patients happy to see 
clinicians other than GPs, are they happy to have phone consultations 
other than face to face etc – this work needs to be evaluated. Work is also 
taking place with PPGs. 

BF commended the work that has taken place so far and also highlighted 
that it is essential to ensure that localities understand that  
there are some givens with this programme, e.g same day weekend 
appointments have to be offered. 

BF also raised concerns around next winter – the London NHS 
advertisements in the Evening Standard etc. are giving patients higher 
expectations, we need ensure we are careful around communications as 
we must not build public expectations if we can’t deliver as this creates 
angst in the system. 

The Committee noted the paper.  

9. 

GP Forward View – Care Navigation, Online Consultation and GP 
Resilience Programme 

DB presented to the JCC.  Key points from the presentation: 

•  Work flow optimisation training is now nearly completed across the 

CCG. 

•  Active Signposting will be the next training to take place - CCGs 
receive money centrally to fund this. ENHCCG has chosen West 
Wakefield as a provider; training should start in the next 2 – 3 
months. 

•  This piece of work will be looking at training staff within practices to 

assist patients with the most appropriate place for them to go for 
their needs. 

•  ENHCCG are planning to include social prescribing and possibly 

improving access to dementia or psychological services – this is all 
to be discussed at the workshop that West Wakefield will be 

Page 7 of 11

Item  Subject 

Action 

by 

holding in the near future with all stakeholders.   

•  There is an indicative budget of £148,000 for GP online 

consultations. A bid was completed on 21 December – recent 
feedback is that the bid was good and that we should start working 
on this project. The funding available is going to be used for a 
project manager. A lot of work needs to be done with primary care 
and the public – this isn’t something that can be put into practice 
without work. 

•  Discussions had taken place around whether the online 

consultation work could be done across the STP. It was decided 
that the project work should be done at CCG level, however work 
will be done at an STP level wherever possible (e.g procurement).  

JG commented that some practices and localities have done some work 
on this already, e.g. using Silicone Footfall in LLV. In East London online 
consultations are already taking place - about 7% of the public across the 
East London area are using it and it is popular with patients of all ages.  

GPRP Presentation

JG presented to the JCC. Key points from the presentation: 

•  NHSE have made some additional money available this year for 
proactive practices that are keen to look at collaborative working 
solutions to enable them to be more resilient. 

•  A single STP submission (ENHCCG and HVCCG) was sent last 
December. The LMC assisted in looking at where the priorities 
might be.  

•  Two groups of practices were taken forward, the LMC 

independently came to the same conclusions as ENHCCG and 
HVCCG supported this – the ENHCCG practices rated higher than 
the HVCCG practices in terms of priority order and therefore the 
ENHCCG practices were put forward as the agreed STP 
submission.   

•  The focus on the programme to date has been on individual 

practices however this is moving towards collaborative working. 
•  There is approximately £60-100k available across each STP and 
funding would be spent on project management that will support 
the two groups of practices, both of whom are very keen to move 
forward with this.   

•  A full GPRP proposal needs to be submitted by 2 February 2018.  

SF informed the group that in her recent phone call with Simon, DB and 
JG, it was advised that Hertford needed to show evidence of how they’re 
working together, therefore SF got the practices to sign a memorandum of 
understanding and Simon was very happy with this evidence. It was 
agreed that this will be done for Letchworth too.  

Page 8 of 11

Item  Subject 

Action 

by 

The diagnostic work that the LMC have largely completed is being 
evaluated and a meeting is scheduled for early next month with the CCG 
about how we take this work forward.  

MT congratulated the CCG on the STP level work that is taking place and 
queried how PPGs can help with the consultation work.  

SF responded that in Hertford the practices are a bit more advanced in 
this work than Letchworth, however patients are involved and are aware of 
what’s going on, information has also appeared in local papers. 
Letchworth practices are working with the Letchworth Heritage Foundation 
and Public Health - lots of engagement is taking place.  

HBo queried the facts around whether online consultations really do free 
up time for GPs as it was found that Silicone Footfall has increased 
access to GPs and therefore their workload.  

DB responded that this was a very valuable point and just because money 
is available it shouldn’t be a knee-jerk reaction to use it immediately – the 
CCG is very conscious of this and will use the money to employ a Project 
Manager to look at this project as a whole, including whether there is a risk 
that this will increase GP workload.  The Project Manager will scope the 
options for this project and it would make sense to look at a small number 
of pilot practices to begin with. 

HB commented that a much bigger piece of work needs to be done with 
the public to understand what they expect from this. What can be seen 
from the LLV work that took place is that 80% of patients were happy to be 
seen by someone other than a GP.  This message has to be aligned with 
communications coming from NHSE that advise patients to see their GP 
(rather than another clinician). If Silicone Footfall is causing more work 
then this is a major issue and PPGs need to be involved.  

DD highlighted that more work needs to take place around IT in practices 
– there is not always the skills and capability to work on what is required, 
things sometimes get put aside because they are too difficult IT wise. 
Queried whether there is any thought about funding and resilience around 
IT skills?  

JG responded that the IMT steering group has a programme of practise 
MOTs where work is taking place to go out and understanding IT 
capability within practices, through this work we will be able to look at how 
we move things forward. Work is already taking place with the Welwyn 
Hatfield Locality.  

DD requested a report at a future JCC / PCC with an update on IMT 
work. 

JG 

DBr informed the committee that he was very interested in online 

Page 9 of 11

Item  Subject 

Action 

by 

consultations and to see how this will affect workload, he believes that 
without this sort of approach he can’t see how primary care is going to 
survive. This is exciting work. 

NS raised concerns that too much access is being given for patients to 
General Practice - some practices started to experiment with telephone 
access and expected this to reduce demand, however it had to opposite 
affect and there is more demand now than ever. Self-help needs to be 
encouraged. NS agreed that online consultation is very helpful, especially 
for those who have difficulty accessing general practice, but we have to be 
very careful with opening extra access otherwise primary care is at risk of  
becoming a small model of A&E.  

DBr highlighted that everyone thinks of online consultations as being 
aligned with urgent care, but it doesn’t have to only be for this area of care 
– it could be used for pill checks, asthma etc.  

JG informed the committee that there is evidence around the country 
where this has worked, but also areas where it hasn’t been quite as useful. 
Work needs to be done before we set this up and it will be important for 
Active Signposting to be part of this.  

DB requested that NHSE colleagues push these messages back to the top 
as there has been crossed messages nationally and locally which are 
giving unrealistic expectations.  

DBr highlighted the importance of this being an MDT approach for it to 
work.  

It was suggested that the programme should have been called ‘Primary 
Care Access’ as opposed to ‘GP Access’ – however this was a national 
decision.

  Prescribing Update 

JS was unable to attend the meeting. However the following update was provided: 
Last LLV prescribing meeting JS been working on a detailed breakdown of prescribing in 
those practices that have a higher than average growth rate (Abbey, Maples, Warden).  

• Meetings booked with all 3 practices to discuss these reports by addressing the 

•
•

•

•

•

recommendations in the reports  
JS is confident that the practices can reduce their growth rates thus helping reduce the 
prescribing overspend in the locality. 
LLV prescribing update would be covered on the agenda at the Primary Care 
Commissioning meetings (PCCM) from now on. 
The abbreviated prescribing minutes will be circulated to the attendees of the PCCM

Action: Prescribing leads - To take updates from the prescribing meetings back to their 
practices to feedback.

PP was unable to attend 
It  should  be  noted  that  East  and  North  Hertfordshire  NHST  implemented  their  new 
Electronic Patient Record System (Lorenzo) in September 2017. As a result of this, there 
are  currently  a  number  of  areas  where  there  is  uncoded  activity  in  the  Month  6  Trust 
SLAM  Report.  This  has  resulted  in  a  larger  value  in  the  “Tariff  related  activity  not 
submitted to MedeAnalytics” line in the Finance Report. This is currently being reviewed 
and the recoded activity will be reflected in the Month 7 Report.

National Diabetes Audit 

It was acknowledged that the locality overall performed very well. Learning was shared for the 
higher performing practices. A key element was to have a good system in place with admin and 
nurses working closely to get patients in.  Also, 4 practices have had no consultant diabetic visits 
as the consultant from the Royal Free who normally attends has left. This info will be feedback to 
CCG LTC meeting. 

The New Local Dementia Pathway 

New local dementia pathway will be due to start in March. Effective communication will be

Introduction and Apologies 
Apologies noted above.  
Declarations of interest 
The Chair invited the Practice Representatives to reconfirm their current 
declarations on the Register of Interests and ensure the current version is the most 
up-to-date. VR updated that a new form is due to be released shortly and will be 
circulated once ready.   
Actions and Notes 

  The minutes of the previous meeting were agreed to be an accurate 

representation 

  All previous actions were confirmed to be still ongoing 

  

The following updates were provided on the previous minutes: 

 

  Query raised regarding cancer referrals and whether they are getting out of 
control? TB advised that the issue was reported to Mark Andrews who will 
escalate, and recommended practices report issues to the contracts hotline. 

  Action: SC will clarify correct process with pathology lab  

 

  SC advised that the query raised at the last meeting regarding the care co-
ordinator for HomeFirst has been investigated and it has been established 
that the role performs 3 main tasks: carrying out prescription runs, home 
visits when HomeFirst does not have capacity and doing MDTs. SC 
commented that the contribution will be evaluated and the locality will then 
decide what to do with the role. 
 

  SC advised that the query regarding the NDPP and how they are mis-

managing cases has been escalated. 
 

  SC commented that the issue with the number of meetings GPs have to 

attend has been recognised by the CCG. 
 

  TB updated that although the locality decided to apply for funding for a full 
time position for 12 Point Care the application will have to now request the 
lower amount due to only a certain amount of funding being available.  
 

  SC commented that the issue with the Ambulance Service has been 

recognised by the CCG and now that the new system is in place it should be 
working better. SC encouraged the locality to share any issues with him. 

  RG reported two recent issues, one involving a patient falling over outside a 

shop where a GP had to attend due to there being a 5 hour wait for an 
ambulance. Another case involved a patient with sepsis being told that there 
was a 5 hour wait for an ambulance. SC encouraged all to escalate cases 
such as these. 
  

  VR updated the locality on the process for recording meeting to aid minute 
taking. The locality agreed that from now on they are happy for all meetings 
to be recorded. 

3. 

Discharge Home to Assess (DH2A) 

  Rohini Widyaratna gave a presentation on the DH2A pathway being piloted 

in the area.  

 
 
 

2 

 

  The pathway has been developed following an audit carried out by Lister 
about stranded patients. The aim of the pathway is to aid capacity in the 
hospital. Focusing initially on Lister, and then to be rolled out to PAH.  
  EoL patients will not be included in this pathway, currently focusing on 

 

patients in Ashwell, 9a and 9b wards.  
 10 care assistants have been recruited to aid HomeFirst to deliver this as 
this is a process they are already partly providing. 

  AP commented that there will be a maximum of 20 patients following this 

pathway, and that it has been set up as the hospital is not the best place for 
these patients to rehab. 10 virtual beds will be created in North Herts 
locality.  

  DH2A will start on the 29th November as a trickle start process. Only people 

who are able to be left alone at night will be included in this.  

  Queried raised regarding what will happen should something go wrong and 
the patient needs additional support. VF added that a process for fast track 
back to the ward they were discharged from without primary care 
involvement is needed to ensure these patients do not increase GP 
workload.  

  TB commented that no one wants patients to stay in the hospital for longer 

than required, but that an escalation process is needed, and preferably a 
number a patient can call other than their GP should they need help or 
support.  

  Action: RW advised that she will share the proposed escalation process with 

the locality 

  VF queried the HCT drug administration process and the purple form, asking 
whether or not this system will still be used as if so the hospital will need to 
ensure these forms are filled out, which could affect the pathway.  

  Action: TB advised that she will take the locality’s reservations back to the 
governing body for discussion, highlighting that discharge information will 
need to be timely and accurate, and encouraging all to report any issues to 
the GP Hotline should they experience any.  

4. 

 North Herts Transformation Plan 

  TB reported that the next submission date is in December, so the locality will 

need to come to a decision regarding a Pharmacist so it can be confirmed 
and the application can be submitted in time.  

  The intended role for a frailty nurse would be to care for frail patients at 

home. The hospice has suggested that the individual could be employed by 
them; however the locality could perform audits to ensure this system is 
working.  

  SC commented that the hospice is eager to be involved in this, so feels that 
they should include them. SC also advised that he feels that this could be a 
big step for 12 Point Care currently, so allowing the hospice to be involved 
could be quicker and easier, and allow them to deal with the difficult issues 
such as HR.  

  RG queried whether a frailty nurse could cope with the amount of nursing 

home admissions? TB commented that although she does not know the 
exact numbers, she believes there is around 4 patients a day and therefore 
20 per week, which she believes would be manageable. SC advised that even 
if this were only a partial solution it would still reduce GP workload.  

  KG further queried whether the frailty nurse would look at temporary 

residents as well? TB advised that she would expect all new residents to be

involved.  

 

  The GMS contract issue regarding temporary residents and care plans has 

been escalated to the CCG and Trudi Southam.  

  TB highlighted that this plan is purely about reducing workload, improving 

patient care and reducing admissions to hospital. 
  

  TB also advised that funding for a Data Analyst for 12 Point Care is still 
available, but warned the locality that the money is non-recurrent and 
therefore available for 1 year only. TB recommended that the locality go 
ahead with the original plan to recruit one post and then decide after a year 
whether to renew the position or not.  
 

  SC commented on an issue currently on-going with Sollershot Surgery not 

being able to become a member of 12 Point Care.  
 

  TB commented that that the workflow optimisation training will be coming 

out of the £1 per patient funding, and advised that she had asked about 
possibly banking the money. 

  AP commented that he could not see a problem with transferring this money 

to next year, but any longer than that could be difficult. 

5. 

  Delegated Commissioning 

  SC gave a presentation on delegated commissioning and advised the locality 

that the governing body is currently split. A recommendation will be 
provided, however it could be likely that the recommendation is that the 
governing body are unable to put forward a recommendation due to being 
undecided. 

  AP commented that some of those who are currently against going 

delegated believe that it is evitable that we will have to go delegated at 
some point, but just believe that now is not the right time. Other members 
of the governing body believe it is time to take control. 

  SC advised that the nominated delegate for each practice should begin to 
prepare for the vote due to take place at the Council of Members meeting 
on the 7th December. 

  Action: VR to share slides  
  AP commented that the money currently held back by NHSE to funding 

overspend elsewhere would be applied to primary care should the CCG go 
delegated, and advised that the CCG are currently underspent on running 
costs. 

  AP also advised that there are only 4 CCGs left in the central Midlands area 

which are not delegated.  

6. 

Provider Board Meeting 

  TB commented that she is keen to proceed with these meetings and make 

the switch to provider board meetings.  

  TB advised that these meeting will be a very important forum for herself 

and SC to take ideas from the locality meeting and talking to providers 
about them, as well as allowing ideas for other areas to be put forward. 

  TB advised that the best course of action is to treat this as a separate 

meeting so the current meeting schedule can continue. TB and SC can then 
meet these providers separately and take issues from this meeting to the 
providers separately.  

  TB suggested starting like this, then if more people need to be involved

9. 

 
Hot Topics and Any Other Business 
 

  Extended Hours DES: SC advised that Extended Hours DES will be continuing 

and that Dee Boardman has advised that the IT is flexible. SC queried 
whether this changes any of the practices’ opinions on what to do about 
extended access. 

  Workforce: Training course due to start week commencing 13th November to 

enhance workforce development. 

  Frailty reviews: Query raised regarding whether other practices are 

struggling to complete these, and whether there is any advice anyone could 
provide on how to find time to complete these. TB commented that doctors 
in her practice have been allowed an extra 20 minutes at the end of clinic to 
look at these, and also suggested getting ST3’s to look at severe plans.  
LMC Roadshow: SC advised that this will be coming to Hatfield and Luton 
and recommended visiting the LMC website to sign up. SC commented that 
the roadshow is looking at recruitment and how to overcome any 
recruitment issues 

 

  Transport service: SC advised that there are plans to revive the voluntary 

service for getting patients to GP practices, and made the locality aware that 
he is due to meet them. 

  MDC: SC advised that this service allows GPs to refer patients with vague 

symptoms and informed the locality that a member of the service is 
currently visiting practices to talk to them about it. 

  CFF Q2: Submission deadline 10th November 
  Respiratory training: training is available, recommended to contact leads if 

interested in attending. 

  Cancer Training Event: SC suggested practice put forward any ideas they may 

have regarding detecting cancer and also advised that Jay Smith from CRUK 
has been visiting practices. 

  Target attendees: SC queried whether locums should be invited to target 

events. Was agreed that they should be as it is nice to be asked, but 
recommends that they should be invited in their own time.

Apologies noted above.  
Declarations of interest 
The Chair invited the Practice Representatives to reconfirm their current 
declarations on the Register of Interests and ensure the current version is the most 
up-to-date.

Actions and Notes 
 

  The minutes of the previous meeting were agreed to be an accurate 

representation subject to the following amendments. 
  All previous actions were confirmed to be still ongoing 

  

The following updates were provided on the previous minutes: 

 

  Transformation plan point 1: is referring to the submission date for a 

pharmacist, not a frailty nurse.  

  Transformation plan point 7: the plan is about reducing workload, improving 

patient care and reducing admissions to hospital. 

  Hot Topics point 3: doctors are doing frailty reviews, not nurses. 

3. 

 
Hitchin Development Update 
 

 

 JC reported that KG will be retiring in the near future, and how this has led 
to discussion around the future of Letchworth and Hitchin areas. ** Please 
note that the full extent of the conversation has been omitted due to not 
being for the public domain. 

 
 North Herts Transformation Plan and Process 

4. 

 

  Workflow Optimisation: TB queried whether everyone had received email 
regarding the backfill cost for workflow optimisation training which is 50p 
per patient per practice. This money cannot be claimed until after the 
training, but TB encourages practices to ensure they have got and read the 
email.  

  Action: VR will check and re-send the email to all practice managers. 

  

  Business and Data Analyst Support for 12 Point Care: TB has received 

invoices for Jenny Walsh. TB confirmed that the money has been approved 
for this use and should be available within the next week. This support will 
be helping with Extended Access and progressing the use of clinical 
pharmacists.  

  Regarding the pharmacists, TB advised that talks are currently taking place 
to try to figure out the best way of employing these positions as it has been 
discovered that the federation cannot employ them due to not having a 
GMS contract. Baldock Surgery and Nevells Road Surgery have suggested 
that they would be happy to employ the individual’s, however TB has asked 
Pauline Walton how other localities have done this to see whether they can 
share the employment risk. If not, TB is looking into the possibility of the 
CCG employing the pharmacists.  

  AP advised that it is not a GMS contract which is required by the federation 

to employ the pharmacists, and that this could be done under an APMS 
contract, which the federation would have if it is planning on providing the 
extended access service. 

  TB advised that the project is still progressing; it is just a case of finding 

someone to host the pharmacists. 

  Question asked regarding whether the money can be rolled over if the 

locality does not spend it in time and AP confirmed that if the funding is

coming from the GP Forward View then this money can be saved and used 
next year. 
  

  Frailty Nurse: The hospice has confirmed that they are able to host these 2 
posts. The roles have been finalised as educating the care home, as well as 
been first access for the care homes should frail patients need support. The 
positions have been advertised and the initial selection will take place on the 
22.01.18 with interviews to take place on 09.02.18 aiming to have them in 
post by the beginning of April. 

  A discussion then took place regarding where these individuals will be based, 

who their line manager will be and who will prioritise their workload, with 
the suggestion being that the locality will wait to see what happens once 
these individuals are in post and will review to ensure there is no conflict 
between the needs of the locality and the hospice.   

  TB also suggested that during the June Target Event these nurses will be 

asked to present and inform the locality about their role and what they are 
doing. 

  TB suggested that should the practices have any concerns regarding the role, 

that they should share them with herself and SC. 

5. 

 
  Locality Development 
 

 

 TB advised that the governing body have been discussing the Provider Board 
meeting versus commissioning meetings, and the differences within each 
locality regarding these meetings. 

  TB advised that the locality’s first provider board meeting took place before 

Christmas and involved the heritage foundation, HPFT, Paul Brown 
Transformation Manager and Sue Plummer from the Hospice. Unfortunately 
no one from the Trust attended, nor did Herts County Council.  

  KS queried whether the agenda and priorities for this meeting could be 

circulated prior to the meeting next time, as he believes the discussion at 
the locality meeting should feed into the provider board. TB agreed that this 
will be happening from now on. 

  A discussion then took place regarding who should be setting the priorities 

for these meetings and who should be planning the agenda.  

  TB advised that the areas agreed during the meeting to look at were mental 

health, frailty and the older population.   

  AP commented that the expectation of the provider board is not to manage 

contracts, but to get the best value out of what has been commissioned. 
  Action: TB will email the group for suggestions regarding topics from the 

group prior to meeting. 

  TR suggested that MSK should be included, someone queried whether NDPP 
could be looked at, although TB advised that as this is a national programme 
it may not be something which could be achievable at the provider board 
meeting. 

  VR advised that a topic she would like to be resolved is with the Trust and 

their management of the 2016/17 contract.

Officer to cover all of the practices in every locality, or whether the 
expectation is for each practice to have their own. AP advised that the CCG 
has not confirmed this yet. Action: TB advised that she will ensure this at 
brought up at the next governing body meeting.  

  DH2A: KS reported that Dr Kendrick has been going out to visit patients and 

then tasking GPs to raise prescriptions and blood tests, some practices 
report that once they have informed Dr Kendrick that she they are happy for 
her to raise prescriptions for their patients then she has not tasked them 
with this. TB commented that DH2A appears to be a separate team to 
HomeFirst so they are not able to use the HomeFirst team to do these tasks. 
Action: VR to look into why the DH2A escalation policy was not circulated as 
promised.   

  Dr Tom Davies – Ambulance Service Safe Guarding Team: MJ queried 

whether any other practices have been receiving communications asking for 
GPs to do an assessment on a patient and forward on to them. Action: JC 
will take back to the service for clarification, suggestion made that the safe 
guarding team in the CCG should be made aware.  

  Care Homes: JP reported an issue with a friend whose mother was unable to 

return to the care home due to a flu outbreak. AP commented that the 
process which should have been followed is that the patient should have 
either stayed in Lister or been sought alternative temporary 
accommodation. 

  Acute in Hours Visiting Service (AiHVS): The above led onto a discussion 

regarding AiHVS being cancelled so the doctors can be diverted to deal with 
the flu outbreaks in care homes. TR commented that it would be between 
the choices of allowing AiHVS to attend and cancelling the service, or 
keeping the service and GPs attending themselves, AP advised that there is 
no contract issue with AiHVS providing this, and this this was decided whilst 
writing the contract to ensure the job did not fall back on GPs. TB queried 
whether the whole service should be cancelled due to an outbreak, or 
whether they should be sending 1 or 2 doctors, and leaving the rest to 
continue the service. AP clarified that the expectation is that the resource 
required to fulfil the job, which would depend on their discretion. TB 
commented that they would like to gain feedback as to their capacity and 
how they managed the issue.  

  Phlebotomy: VF queried the current phlebotomy service wait time being 

around 17-18 weeks. AP advised that this should be mentioned at governing 
body.  

  Duplication of Path results: comment made that this problem has arisen yet 

 

again. 
In House Target: TB commented that this is due to take place on 23rd 
January, and all practices should advise Richard Stanley of their agenda.   

  Dates for next year: VR commented that dates are being sought for April to 

April, and informed the locality that there will now only be 1 council of 
members meeting due to take place on the same day as the AGM. Dates to 
avoid bank holidays, half terms and end of financial year. The agenda for the 
Cancer Target has been set and will be circulated shortly, TB advised that 
there is still money available in the budget after planning this event to use to 
improve screening techniques; this will be discussed in detail at the target. 
HUC cover for this event is available all afternoon.

British Heart Foundation Blood Pressure Award Programme – Round 2 

See enclosed presentation provided by Fiona Oliver: 

•

Programme ran until the last interview stage in previous years, is now looking to 
work with a small group of localities to deliver the pathway. 

• Current minimum population is 100,000 patients, and the pathway is currently 

working with ULV and LLV localities.

• Current pathway uses community pharmacists, fire, safe and well,  Active Herts and 
others to test blood pressure, with process being that if the patient’s blood pressure 
shows as high on the first blood test, they are asked to come back for another test. If 
this test result is high again the patient is asked to either visit their surgery, or call 
111.
Pathway will be using PharmaOutcomes for community pharmacy to inform GP of 
results and readings, and is looking into ways of other providers providing practices

with this information.
Pathway is currently running as a pilot, so not set in stone quite yet.
In terms of how many extra patients GPs many end up seeing FO advises that it is 
normally an average of 1-2. In terms of timescales if a patients reading is high, it does 
depends on the reading itself and the subsequent level they are categorised in. If a 
patient is categorised in red level then they are advised to see a GP within 24 hours. 
FO asks support from the locality to run this as a pilot in the locality as Stevenage has 
a high mortality rate in this area.  
• Action: FO will share red criteria. 

•

5.

Contracts Hotline 

• AC provided an update on Contracts Hotline issues, advising the locality that in quarter 3 

they reported 104 queries, which is 17% of the overall queries throughout the CCG. 
• Recent queries have included discharge summary issues with the trust, phlebotomy 

issues, GP referral line issues. 

• New queries: fracture pathway – information coming out regarding this shortly regarding 

the pathway. CC advised that she was meant to be receiving something regarding this 
today and will forward on to AC once received, AC will then circulate via the bulletin and 
to GP leads.  

• Recent queries regarding screening and Exeter which have been picked up with NHSE 

and Capita, the delays have been caused by updates, which have caused a backlog.  

• Med3’s and GPs being asked to follow up on results requested by hospital clinicians has 
been addressed by Rachel Joyce Medical Director, and the Medical Director at the trust, 
so should hopefully be resolved. 

• RH commented that this feedback is very valuable and requests that AC return to the 

• AC commented that a quarterly report is sent to practices, and asks practice to let her 

meeting monthly to update the locality. 

know if this is not being received. 

6.

Prescribing Update –  

• MD reported that prescribing finance was quite positive – forecast overspend has 
reduced significantly since M6 now at +£116,253, year on year growth has reduced 
considerably and although the spend / patient is still highest in Stevenage because of the 
slower growth this differential between other localities is reducing. QP performance is 
good, the locality and CCG are achieving all 3 antibiotic related QP targets including 
trimethoprim in the >70s. Some practices are still red. Steady performance against the 
KPI targets. Ade is starting to look at specials and has identified some potential savings, 
some specials cannot be changed but in some cases formulation changes can make 
significant savings.  

• Gluten free product prescribing – all practices have been sent a list of their patients who 

are currently prescribed GF products (not all coeliac) this did not exclude patients with 
LD or safeguarding concerns. The practices represented confirmed they had sent letters 
outlining changes to all affected patients. 

7.

Finance and Locality Information Pack (LIP) update (see pack)

•

SA reported that there is no finance update due to changes in the trust’s systems causing 
anomalies. These issues need to be fixed before an update can be shared, although this is 
being addressed with the trust.

LTC Update 

Information circulated regarding the National Diabetes Audit which compared 3 CCGs 
between 2015/16 and 2016/17 and found that in 2015/16 ENHCCG did better than the 
national average, achieving 41.7% when the national average is 37.3% for Type 1 
diabetics, and for Type 2 achieved 55.5% when the national average is 53.9%. 
In regards to 16/17 data ENHCCG fell under the national average as did the other CCGs in 
the area.

• Breaking down into localities within the CCG Stevenage is in the middle with 40%, coming 

above ULV and North Herts. This info is also broken down into practices, with the 
practice preforming best in the area being Bedwell with 47%. 
IC also advised that he is leaving at the end of March and a new GP representative will be 
required. Action: RP will advertise this position.

Localities GPFV £1.50 Non-Recurrent Monies spend 

•

•

•

•

•

• MB advised that part of the £1.50 spend has been put towards an extended access 
project, example of what the money has been used on elsewhere is: silicon footfall, 
training for HCAs and clinical pharmacists, new models of care for towns, target events 
for practice staff, clinical leadership, a business manager and social prescribing projects. 

• Approximately £48,000 to be spent by the 31st March.  
• MB recommends spending the money on Silicon Footfall as it would link in with extended 

access, and would allow practices to link together and promote services.  

• MB advised that silicon footfall is a very interactive website which advises other areas of 

care they can access. 

• All practices decided that they money will be spent on Silicon Footfall with no objections. 

10. Patient Participation Group Update 

KM advised that he had attended 2 patient participation group since the last meeting, 
one at Roebuck and one at Manor House.

• Roebuck Surgery have been doing some work on DNAs which has hugely reduced the 

amount of DNAs they are experiencing to 16. 
Starting 17th Jan HealthWatch will have a presence at the Lister for once a month, 
hopefully changing to once a fortnight. 

• On the 31st Jan the Stevenage Dementia Action Alliance will meet with representatives 

from groups such as the fire brigade, borough councillors, and various others. This group 
have also applied for funding from the Chauncey Trust.  

11. AOB 

•

•

Education Lead: PM informed the group that the role of Stevenage Education Lead has 
been vacated by Vishen, who has nominated Obe to take over the role. It involves 2 
sessions a month and deals with workforce issues. The role does not need to be filled by 
a GP and can be a nurse, so PM invited anyone interested in the role to step forward. If 
there is no interest Obe will fill this role and will be invited to attend these meeting going 
forward. KS asked that this role and her role as nurse tutor should be linked to ensure 
collaborative working.  
Phlebotomy: SL advised that an update will be provided on the 17.01.18 due to a re-
working of the plan following further funds being available. This update will be presented 

4 | P a g e

at the Stevenage Health Meeting and will be circulated via email after. SL advised that 
the extra funding would provide around 500 more appointments per week. 1 role has 
been recruited, and 1 role is still vacant, being recruited. 

• Ward Rounds: SL advised that regarding Winter Pressures, the funding has changed 

slightly so funding will not be provided until the KPIs are submitted, meaning invoices 
can no longer be paid in advance. SL informed the locality that this may cause delays to 
payments. SL also commented that in terms of Care Home Ward Rounds it was 
previously agreed in November that £1/patient funding will be used to fund ward rounds 
on a Wednesday. 

• AiHVS: EC reported that the practice had tried to book AiHVS and been informed that 
there was no capacity due to one practice using 10 visits due to nursing home flu. RH 
advised that AiHVS have been covering the flu outbreaks in nursing homes. 

• CDC: EC reported that a doctor did an urgent referral to CDC on the 29.11.18 for a child 

•

•

to be seen and the patient still has not heard. EC queried how long they should be 
waiting for an assessment. SR confirmed that she would be happy to look into this should 
EC be able to send her the dates.        
£1/patient money: PM queried whether it is possible to roll this money forward much 
like the locality have done in previous years as it would be useful to use it for the 
phlebotomy service. SA confirmed that he will check and let the locality know. 
Training section of the Trust website: East & North Hertfordshire NHS Trust publishes the 
grand round programme via the GPs & Professionals page of the Trust website.  The 
education team suggests any GPs wishing to attend, should arrive for 12:30 as there is 
hot food.  Presentations are from 13:00 – 14:00.  Some dates will be attended by 
sponsors that may be of interest to GPs. The Trust also provides information on other 
training opportunities for GPs.  There is currently a CPD module on Paediatric ADHD 
through Pulse Learning, provided by Dr Susan Ozer.  To access the training, please use 
the following link: http://www.enherts-tr.nhs.uk/gps-professionals/training/ Action: RP 
to circulate to practices 

• Vanguard: SE reported savings experienced in other areas with nutritionists visiting care 
homes. So far this service has visited around 12 care home and has estimated savings of 
around £100,000, with £6,000 worth of prescribed nutritional supplements being 
stopped per patient. SE suggested looking at how you can target cohorts of patients to 
make these sorts of savings.  
Frailty Nurse: JD reported that the hospice is hosting 2 frailty nurses funded by North 
Herts locality, starting on the 09.02.17. The roles involve education around frailty and 
completing initial assessments, as well as attending ward rounds with GPs. 

•

• DH2A: Report provided on DH2A which is very positive, with no resources being pulling 

from Rapid Response. More capacity is available.

LF shared top tips to referring into the service. They are as follows 

•Perform clinical searches for patients who have a BMI of >30 and have attended Slimming 
World© or Weight Watchers© in previous 12 months (regardless of outcome if BMI remains 
>30) 
•Refer patients with a BM  >30 who have an actual or estimated QRisk score of 10 or more (this 
may be following an NHS Health Check) An NHS health check 

The criteria for being eligible for a referral is as follows: 

They must be registered with a GP in Stevenage of Watford and Three Rivers 

•
• Be over 18 years 
• Have a BMI of 30+ 
• Not be pregnant 
• Have attended Slimming World©, Weight Watchers© or ShapeUp© in the previous 12 

months (can be self-referral) OR have an estimated or actual QRisk2 score of 10 or more. 

For further information contact Hertfordshire Health Improvement Service: 
healthimprovementservice@hertfordshire.gov.uk

LF asked practices to feedback on why they are not engaged with making referrals, would be 
most welcome. It will be very unlikely that they will relax the referral criteria to remove the 
3 | P a g e

requirement for patients to have attempted weight loss with Slimming World or Weight 
Watchers. As long as these services remain funded, they will be the first line of support for 
patients.

Foot Fall - localities GPFV £1.50 Non-Recurrent Monies spend - Jane Oddy - Director Silicon 
Practice Ltd  

•

•

Jane Oddy, Director of Silicon Footfall did a presentation of how the interface works for 
practices 
The attachment is guidance for federations implementing footfall. 

Silicon Footfall - 
Extended Access

• MB recommends spending the money on Silicon Footfall as it would link in with extended 

access, and would allow practices to link together and promote services.  

• MB advised that silicon footfall is a very interactive website which advises other areas of 

care they can access. 

• All practices decided that they money will be spent on Silicon Footfall with no objections. 

7.

Prescribing Update –  

•

•

Stevenage have seen a slight increase in monthly spend compared to other localities and 
the forecast position for M8 is now £210K over spend (1.62%) this is the second lowest 
across the CCG. It is hard to explain these swings especially over the Christmas period 
and this can vary depending on how practices choose to manage their Christmas 
prescriptions.  
KPI position for M 8 positive and most going in the right direction. The CCG is achieving 
all antibiotic related QP targets 

8.

Finance  

• Month 8 – Currently there is an underspend. SC encouraged good work 
• GP prescribing and continuing healthcare costing the most. 
• Currently redesigning locality pack 
•
• Acute £8000 underspend 

1.2 million pounds contingency

PM said the federation needs to strengthen up. There is lack of commitment and this 
requires change. The federation needs to be empowered. 
Practices need to consider what their commitment level is. 
Federation objectives would be to derive CQC policy, phlebotomy contracts etc. 

•
•

Declarations of Interest 
 
The Chair invited Practice Representatives to reconfirm that their current declarations on the Register of 
Interests which were circulated with the meeting papers were accurate and up-to-date.   
 

  Members confirmed their interests were accurate and up-to-date 
  No conflicts of interests to agenda items were reported. 

 
Age UK  
 

  NW welcomed Matthew Charles (MC) from Age UK who gave a verbal presentation on Age UK’s 

integrated service which has given support over a number of years to older and vulnerable people, 
either coming out of hospital, suffering from ill health, or at risk of being admitted to hospital. MC 
reported that they are already delivering a Community Navigation Service in Herts Valley.  

  Age UK have been tasked to reduce hospital visits, reduce GP home visits, reduce loneliness and 

improve general health and well-being of patients. 

  The Board were informed they have recruited a Programme Manager and 2 Area Managers to 
further develop the service. MC will be leading in the East and North, Senior Navigators will be 
recruited for dual localities and locality teams will carry out visits.  The dual Localities will be North 
Herts and Stevenage, Welhat and Lower Lea Valley, Upper Lea Valley and  Stort Valley & Villages 
and to also include PAH with each Locality having 3 Navigators. It is anticipated that services 
would be up and running by January/February. 

  NW clarified that Social Prescribing came out of the GPFV and that there are two elements, one 

being face to face consultations for patients with slightly complex needs and the other being Herts 
Help which will be telephone or web based. 

  The Locality will be working with Anna Makepeace and the Provider Board to ensure that the 

navigation is linked to Rapid Response. 

  MC will be invited back to the locality Board in the New Year when the service has been 

 

 

 

 

established.  

 
Footfall Presentation

  Declaration of Interest 

 
VR asked that all members double check that the declarations of interest are 
up  to  date,  and  to  contact  her  should  a  new  form  be  needed  to  update.  VR 
also commented that out of date names need to remain on the spread sheet 
for 6 months before being removed. 
 

3.   

  Minutes and actions of previous meeting 

 
The minutes of the previous meeting were agreed to be an accurate 
representation following the below corrections: 

  Change the comment “Long period . . . yes” 
  Adjustments to the numbering of each item from 6 onwards 
 

Item 4: SE clarified that the comment she made regarding sharing 
data with Stevenage was based around the idea that the locality are 
employing someone to do work which could be relevant to WelHat 
locality as well. SE does not believe the locality need to recruit a data 
analyst, and asked whether both localities could share.  

Action: VR will see whether Stevenage information is available to be 
shared and will distribute if so.   

 
SE commented that the previous discussion regarding e-referrals to 
secondary care and MSK is still being passed back to GPs and is causing 
issues, queried whether there was any update regarding this. RJ Advised that 
this has been picked up with HCT but as the national pathway for booking 
changes in new year, this should rectify itself( Check with Rachel) 

  

Flu: The locality Flu plan has been approved. AS is leading on this. The funds 
are to be sent to Wrafton House and will be used from there. VR informed the 
group that marketing packs are available and asked practice managers to 
please collect them before leaving. 

  SE queried who to claim to for use of MJOG, Action: VR will get clarity 

on the process and share with PMs.

Elective and A&E admission figures 
 
Data  Collection  Information  has  been  circulated,  AS  recommended  that  the 
practices  reflect  on  the  data  and  if  wish  to  discuss  further  a  task  and  finish 
group  meeting  can  be  arranged,  which  JW  agreed  toarrange  if  required.  SE 
commented  that  the  document  is  a  starting  point  however  does  not  provide 
information regarding what the locality need to do. JW introduced Aysha who 
is  the  information  analyst  for  WelHat.  JW  recommended  Practice  Managers 
contact Aysha with any feedback for changes which may need to be made to 
the searches, so that the data collection information meets the locality’s need. 
JW  confirms  that  the  CCG  are  happy  to  adjust  the  data  searches  however, 
the locality need to tell the CCG what they want so it can then be adjusted to 
aid this. Mede data should also help the locality to identify what they want to 
look at. RJ advised that there was a demand analysis drawn up a year ago for 
each locality, she recommended that this report may also help.  
 
RJ  stated  that  a  pilot  scheme  is  being  rolled  out  evaluating  frequent  flyers. 
This  will  target  patients  who  are  regular  attending  A  and  E  and  looking  to 
provide targeted care plans and management for these patients. This is due 
to  be  piloted  in  WelHat,  and  also  highlights  that  this  data  can  be  used  and 
adapted  to  help  in  any  way  the  locality  may  wish.  This  area  was  being 
assessed due to this being 1 area of the locality’s  high overspend, there are 
other areas which can be looked at, and Mede contains various other reports, 
but the locality will need to decide what they want to do, and how they want to 
look  at  this  data.  The  CCG  will  provide  support  to  the  locality  in  assessing 
other areas.  
 
 

5.   
 

  CCG update and Locality Plans 

 
AS informed that the last GB meeting was held on the 21st of September and 
commented that  the  CCG  were  rated  as  outstanding  based  on  56  indicators 
set by NHSE. 
 
The performance report looked at services provided including East and North 
Herts  Trust  and  showed  that  targets  are  being  met  for  2  week  wait  Cancer 
referrals,  and  the  breast  clinic    are  meeting  referral  targets.  Unfortunately, 
they are not meeting any targets for 31 or 62 day treatment targets; this issue 
has been escalated with the providers.  
SG  updated  that  the  rest  of  the  GB  meeting  was  spent  discussing  de-
commissioning  decisions,  with  the  recommendation  being  discussed  in  JCC 
on the 12th October and a final decision taken forward with the results due to 
be released on the 13th October.  
 

6.   

  Financial Update  

 

 

 
The financial report at month 4 showed that the CCG are surplus of £262k, 
and are forecasting to deliver an under spend of £14,498k which would meet 
the target, this is mainly due to primary care. Most localities apart from North 
Herts and SVV are also overspent, WelHat are £259k overspent which is due 
to acute expenditure; the locality is under spent on non-electives by £412k. 

 

Non-acute is only overspent by £4k. Looking at non-acute segmentally CHC 
is still over-spending, but has been complicated by under spend in the 
community services such as HCT.  
 
JW advised some of the issues surrounding month 4 is some costs are 
coming through on tariff so work will have to take place in month 5 to make 
sure the right pricing is happening. This is especially the case around the 
Better Care for Stroke, which carries a premium payment if achieved. Work 
will have to take place to ensure these premiums are been charged to the 
right locality and not charged inappropriately.SE was unsure what this meant 
and JW clarified that in report there is a line which states tariff related activity 
not stated, and for WelHat which has an over spend of half a million pounds. 
That tariff includes diagnostics and what we pay the trust against what is 
costed through SUS, which usually differs due to timing or activity not being 
costed appropriately. The CCG finance team is looking at these costs to 
ensure they are distributed through the localities accurately. 
SE queried whether the CCG have any contingency plans with the under 
spend, JW advised that no plan is in place, as the overall locality spend, is 
about right, but just in the wrong locations. JW advised that the better care for 
stroke patients is for when the patient has been seen quickly and the criteria 
has been met then we pay the trust a premium as an incentive. It is a 
premium on top of original payment for when the trust meets all the specified 
criteria which gives the patient better care.

  LTC Update  - Dr Sarah Hoole

that  everyone  had 

 
Apologies sent from Dr Sarah Hoole, last meeting was cancelled. 
 
Prescribing update – Allison Baldwin 
 
Allison Baldwin also sent apologies as there is no further update since the last 
meeting,  however,  did  want 
received 
communications  and  guidance  regarding  smoking  cessation  service  and  the 
vouchers.  VR  advised  If  anyone  does  need  help  accessing  the  vouchers 
please  contact  Sharon  O’Connor  and  Liz  Fisher  from  the  stop  smoking 
service. 
 
Mental health update  -  Dr Preenal Shah 
 
Paper has been circulated 
  
Workforce planning and education update – Dr Ashish Shah 
 
Further update to be provided after the next workforce planning meeting next 
week. 

8.   

  PPG update – Peter Wilson 

 
At the last PPG meeting on the 4th October a presentation was given by Dee 
Boardman  on  the  5  year  forward  view  and  extended  access.  Statistics  were 
provided on the Lets Talk consultation and GP survey.  
 

 

 

 

The  cancer  working  group  has  produced  3  slides  on  breast  cancer  which 
should  be  showing  soon  on  practice  information  screens,  as  well  as  leaflets 
being distributed from Cancer Research.  
 
During  PCG  meeting  members  were  asked  to  promote  membership  of  the 
dementia action alliance to their practices.  
 

9.   

  Any Other Business 

 
SPA Referrals 
LC  queried  SPA  referrals  service  as  the  new  email  address  provided  on  the 
recently  circulated  forms  electronically  had  not  been  updated  on  the 
SystemOne  forms,  which  still  contained  the  old  email  address  so  was 
concerned that GPs had been sending referrals to the wrong address. Action: 
VR to feed this back to the SPA team to get this amended. 
 
Ardens 
 
LC advised that the Ardens searches need improving and asked whether this 
could be escalated further.  
 
RJ suggested inviting Zaid Ismail and Jamie Archer to the locality meeting to 
speak about these issues. Action: VR to arrange 
 
Care Homes LES  
 It was queried whether   the Care Homes LES audit could be carried out  in 
the first month of every quarter instead of the last month of every quarter as at 
the  moment  it  only  allows  practice  managers  two  weeks  to  get  the  relevant 
information together, switching the month which gets audited would allow two 
months to gather the data instead. AS will pass this to Barbara Harrison and 
Harper Brown. 
 
SE commented that the CFF update contains a lot  of changes, a lot  of work 
on  LTC  and  the  fact  that  they  are  now  required  to  do  2%  of  practice 
population. This amount will be difficult to find considering the overlap, which 
SE has already fed back. 
 
 
Training Fund 
It  was  queried  whether  there  was  a  training  fund  available  to  practices.  AS 
suggested that this year’s £1 per patient money  can be used to aid training. 
SE stated that previously the money was £30,000, which was split by list size 
and  managed  through  the  federation.  It  was  agreed  to  split  the  money 
accordingly and the practice can choose to use it as they deemed necessary 
but for training courses. 
 
SE  queried  about  the  GP  trainers  ARCP  Attendance  funding,  which  has 
stopped.  and  sending  out  a  GP  without  re-imbursement  just  increases  the 
pressure. Backfill for this course cannot be funded through this money and AS 
suggested

approached.

Peer Review  
 
RJ  raised  the  subject  of  peer  reviews  and  explained  that  NHSE  have 
mandated that these are now mandatory on all prospective referrals. An audit 
has  already  been  carried  out  and  found  that  60%  of  practices  are  already 
carrying out peer reviews.  
 
Going forward, a lot of referrals will be triaged anyway, so it was suggested to 
focus on the two specialties which have the most referrals which are ENT and 
Gynecology.  Agreed  thresholds  for  referrals  are  being  developed,  including 
what to do before you refer and what to include in a referral letter, which will 
all  be  going  on  the  website,  and  the  CCG  will  be  asking  practices  to  self-
certify that practices have peer reviewed all ENT and Gynecology referrals. It 
was queried whether this will cause delays with referrals, RJ commented that 
this  process  will  be  reviewed  in  3  months  to  see  whether  it  has  made  a 
difference  to  the  number  of  referrals,  and  if  it  hasn’t  this  will  be  fed  back  to 
NHSE.  
AK suggested that This was done in past and was not found to be useful. The 
locality thought this was not a stream they would like to work at present.
