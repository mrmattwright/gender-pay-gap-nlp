At Slater and Gordon, we believe the Gender Pay Gap legislation is an important part of wider efforts to encourage businesses to focus on tackling inequality.  Like other businesses we are required to publish gender pay information. To demonstrate our commitment to equality within the workplace, we have decided to go beyond the minimum requirements and publish our complete gender pay and bonus gap figures – including all LLP members.  Our data shows encouraging results in certain areas of the Group, there is more we can do to ensure we are at the forefront of driving progress.  We also recognise this is not just an issue of pay. It is also one of making sure we are continually challenging ourselves to provide the best work environment. This will help us attract and retain excellent people and help all our colleagues to develop and progress.
