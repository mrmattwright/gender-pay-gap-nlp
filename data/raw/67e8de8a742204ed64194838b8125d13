As a company, we encourage both men and women to progress their careers within the Nycomm Group of Companies and use internal moves and promotions to fill vacancies where possible.       The gender pay gap report gives a snapshot of the difference in average earnings of all male and female employees at Nycomm as of April 2017.  Our workforce on the snapshot date was made up of 38% females , 62% males .       Female Male       Gender Pay and Bonus Gap           Median  Mean    Gender Pay Gap  10.27%  23.13%    Gender Bonus Gap  37.55%  37.36%          At Nycomm, we have more males than females in senior roles, which gives us a 10.27% median difference between male and female employees’ average pay.       The gap between male and female bonus pay can be explained by the higher proportion of males in senior roles. More senior roles are expected to deliver significantly higher targets and attract a higher bonus earning potential.  The gender pay gap reporting guidelines for bonus pay unfortunately do not make any allowance for part time workers, who would earn proportionally less of their bonus than a full time employee. We offer flexible working to encourage women and men with caring responsibilities to progress in their careers, however this is currently primarily taken up by female employees. 89% of our part time workers are female and 18% of all females who received a bonus worked part time (compared to 2% of males).      Average Hourly Pay by Quartiles      Lower  Male Female    Lower Middle  Male Female    Upper Middle  Male Female    Upper  Male Female     79% of our employees in the upper quartile for pay are male , which includes directors, heads of department and senior sales roles. We are looking to address this through increasing female representation in more senior roles. We always aim to consider both female and male candidates when recruiting for senior positions through proactive recruitment to source a balanced shortlist of candidates.       Proportion of employees receiving a bonus       Male Female       A higher proportion of females than males receive a bonus at Nycomm, as we have a higher proportion of females working in sales and sales support roles. 69% of females and 54% of males received a bonus.  We also have a number of roles that do not attract a bonus or commission and are predominantly filled by males, such as warehouse roles, engineers and IT.       In Summary…  We are confident that we pay women and men equally for equivalent roles and our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work.  We recognise that we have work to do to address the gender pay gap. There is no one factor that will solve the gender pay gap, however, through our commitment to recruiting, supporting and developing talented females in our workforce, we aim to progressively close the pay gap at Nycomm.       I confirm that our data has been calculated according to the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  C P Gee  Executive Director         Get in Touch!
