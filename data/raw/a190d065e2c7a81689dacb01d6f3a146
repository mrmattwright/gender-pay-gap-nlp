The latest pay data is based on the snapshot date of 31 March 2017. The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean and median) earnings of men and women. Used to its full potential, gender pay gap reporting is a valuable tool for assessing levels of equality in the workplace, female and male participation, and how effectively talent is being maximised. The gender pay gap differs from equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. Equal pay is unlawful and a gender pay gap is not. This is due to the causes of a gender pay gap not falling within the direct control of an employer.  Results 296 employees are included in the pay period. 50% of which are female and 50% are male. The mean gender pay gap is 10.0% In terms of hourly rates this equates to: MEAN hourly rate of all male employees of £12.76 MEAN hourly rate of all female employees of £11.49 The median gender pay gap is 0.0% In terms of hourly rates this equates to: MEDIAN hourly rate of all male employees of £10.00 MEDIAN hourly rate of all female employees of £10.00 The Council does not pay bonuses and therefore this element of the gender pay gap reporting does not apply.
