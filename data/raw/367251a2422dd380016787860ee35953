Put simply, we really understand the data behind people, revealing who they are, what they like - and what they don’t.  We do this by combining trillions of data records relating to people’s identity, from all over the world. And we use this information to help our clients make the right decisions about their customers and employees.  We operate in 3 main areas       Fraud, risk & compliance  Protect against fraud & loss without the risk of non-compliance     Customer & location intelligence  Managing data quality through customer and location intelligence     Employee screening solutions  Verify existing workers and new recruits, wherever you, or they, are in the world      What is identity?  Identity is what makes each of us unique. It's the characteristics that define us. And in an increasingly digital world, identity is dynamic. Social media and mobile technology mean the lines between offline and online, and public and private, have become increasingly blurred.            Biometric   Fingerprints  Retina  Voice  DNA     Behavioural   Interests  Likes  Dislikes  Usage patterns       Attributed   Name & address  Passport  Social security  Education qualifications     Digital   Device ID  IP address  Social ID  Cookies         But identity is important to all of us. To an individual it’s what makes you, well, you. And to a business, understanding customer's or employee's identity allows you to deliver a uniquely personal experience. All without introducing unnecessary risk.  Data is good  We believe identity data is a force for good. It enables us to use the Web quickly and easily. Identity data intelligence provides the additional layer of risk management to keep us all safe.         Office locations  Our head office is in Chester in the UK, but we have teams in 24 locations all over the world.  Read more >    Working at GBG  People engagement at GBG is consistently above 80%.
