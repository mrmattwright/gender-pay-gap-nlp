Women in Finance 
and Gender Pay Gap 

September 2017

Foreword

In June 2016, we signed up to HM 
Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter, 
a commitment to improve gender 
balance across the financial services 
sector, at every level. As a challenger 
business, we know and understand 
the need to challenge the status quo 
and our ambitions around gender 
and diversity are no different. Since 
signing up to the Charter, we have 
embarked on a journey to improve 
gender balance and have made 
some significant steps. We aim to 
ensure women are not only better 
represented within Aldermore but 
most importantly supported. Our 
investment in the Charter will continue 
over the coming months and years to 
ensure it is embedded into our culture 
for the benefit of everyone now and in 
the future.

Whilst the Women in Finance Charter 
focuses on gender diversity, 

our ambitions are much greater. 
We want to ensure our workforce is 
diverse and inclusive and our culture 
continues to be open, collaborative 
and respectful. We think we’re getting 
some things right as our colleagues 
continue to feel immensely proud to 
work here - in fact 91%1  of them have 
told us so, but we know there’s more to 
do. Building on this, we are committed 
to creating a Bank that people want 
to work for and where they feel 
welcomed and involved at all levels 
regardless of their race, ethnicity, 
gender, age, disability, religion or belief, 
sexual orientation, marital status, 
gender reassignment and pregnancy 
and maternity. To help us shape our 
thinking and ambition around all areas 
of Diversity & Inclusion we have 
also joined Stonewall, a LGBT rights 
charity in the UK as well as the enei, 
The Employers Network for Equality & 
Inclusion. 

Women In Finance and Gender Pay – our goals

By signing up to the Charter, we have committed as a business to: 

It’s not just numerical targets 
we’ve set ourselves. We’ve set up a 
taskforce to help us drive forward a 
number of initiatives and this report 
will update you on our progress. 
We’re also taking the opportunity to 
provide an update on our gender pay 
gap figures, which as of June 2017 
stood at 29.9%. We are confident 
in our knowledge that the principal 
reason we see the gap is due to the 
representation of females in our senior 
leadership population. We have taken 
the opportunity to release our figures 
earlier than required and transparently 
– one of our core pillars. 

Phillip Monks, OBE,  
Chief Executive Officer

We have also gone one step further 
to set ourselves a target around our 
gender pay:

Having  30% of our 
senior managers as 
female by 2020

Ensuring a  50/50 
gender split across 
the Bank is maintained

To close  our pay 
gap year on year

Women in Finance and Gender Pay GapSeptember  2017The aim of the Woman in Finance ‘Steering 
Committee’  is to ensure we’re debating and 
discussing the right actions we need to take 
as a business to make progress against our 
Women in Finance commitments. 

Our accountable senior executive is 
Christine Palmer, our Chief Risk Officer 
who joined Aldermore in early 2016. 
Christine established a Woman in 
Finance ‘Steering Committee’ shortly 
after the Bank agreed to sign up to 
the Charter last year. The aim of the 
group is to ensure we’re debating and 
discussing the right actions we need 
to take as a business to make progress 
against our Women in Finance Charter 
commitments. In the last 12 months 
we’ve focused on increasing female 
representation across our senior 
leadership population, encouraged 
and supported individuals across the 
Bank for promotion and reviewed 
existing policies to encourage and 
support flexible working within the 
organisation. It’s not just women 

involved, this group is made up of 
a diverse group of colleagues from 
different parts of the Bank, who are 
passionate and interested in achieving 
a balanced and fair workforce. The 
Committee has also been supported 
by a Women’s network whose purpose 
is to ensure every colleague can 
fulfil their full potential by creating 
a supportive group to share ideas 
around the Bank. They’ve held some 
really insightful events in bringing 
people together to hear from relevant 
speakers and an environment where 
they can access the help and tools 
they need. They’ve been joined by a 
number of key internal and external 
speakers including our interim chair, 
Danuta Gray, non-executive director, 
Cathy Turner and our Chief Risk 

Officer, Christine Palmer, all holding 
sessions discussing their career 
journey so far and how they’ve 
successfully navigated the world of 
business as a female. We’ve seen real 
benefits to holding these sessions 
for our colleagues – with 100%2 of 
attendees finding these sessions 
useful. The Women’s network 
continues to evolve and has been 
developed to fit with the Bank’s overall 
Diversity and Inclusion ambition. Now 
known as the Inclusion@Aldermore 
network, this support group has 
been created following feedback 
internally from our colleagues to 
ensure they are fully supported to 
do their role regardless of their race, 
ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or 
background.

Internal feedback from Aldermore colleagues 

Women in Finance and Gender Pay GapSeptember  2017We’re making really good progress 
on ensuring we meet the 30% target 
of women in senior leadership roles 
by 2020. We have nine females in 
leadership roles accounting for 26.5% 
of our leadership team and they are in 
key roles across the business. We have 
seen a number of female promotions 
into senior roles over the course of the 
past year, which has accounted for 
our increased percentage, from 21% to 
26.5%, and ultimately see us on track 
to meeting the target we set out for 
2020. 

One of our key focus areas to ensure 
better representation at senior level 
has been our approach to recruitment. 
We introduced unconscious bias 
training for all our leadership team, 
helping our leaders recognise their 
actions, both negative and positive, 
that exists in our subconscious 
affecting the decisions we make.

gender split at 
Aldermore and our 
aim is to ensure 
this remains so

In addition to this, we’ve changed our 
recruitment process and now require 
a diversified shortlist for all senior 
positions meaning broadly a 50/50 split 
of male and female candidates being 
put forward for roles. We believe this 
step has helped us increase our female 
representation within Aldermore at a 
senior level. We’ve still work to do but 
we’re well on track and pleased with our 
progress. 

We’re also really pleased to have 
maintained a broad 50/50 gender split 
at Aldermore and our aim is to ensure 
this remains.

Enabling women within our business to 
succeed remains a priority and building 
an environment for our colleagues to 
develop is key. Our Steering Committee 
has worked closely with our HR team 
to develop and enhance our existing 
mentoring programme to make this 
opportunity available to everyone. Our 

mentoring programme will play a vital 
role as part of our plan to increase 
and exceed our female representation 
across senior roles and as we head 
towards meeting our goals for 2020, 
we will strive to improve and implement 
further new policies to ensure that 
we’re creating opportunities for all. 

Our training programmes also help us 
to deliver success for all our colleagues. 
As a business we run numerous training 
and development programmes to 
ensure we have an engaged, skilled 
and knowledgeable workforce. Out of 
the colleagues, both male and female, 
who took part in one of the Bank’s 
training programmes over the past 
year, we have seen 28% take on a new 
role by their next performance review 
within the business and almost 12% 
of colleagues actually moving into line 
management roles – helping us to 
move the dial on our targets for 2020.

Women in Finance and Gender Pay GapSeptember  2017Gender pay gap

In our progress report we also wanted 
to update on our gender pay gap. The 
gender pay gap is an equality measure 
that shows the difference in average 
earnings between women and men3 . 
The Equality Act 20104 (Gender pay gap 
Information) Regulations 2016 aims to 
tackle the gender pay gap that exists in 
organisations and provide transparency 
around gender pay gap differences. 
The regulation requires employers with 
more than 250 employees to report 
to the government and make publicly 
available their gender pay gap metrics. 

you take all employees into account). 
The calculation behind the gender pay 
gap is not the same as equal pay.   
The underlying reason behind the 
gap is predominantly due to the lower 
representation of women in senior 
leadership roles within our business 
– which is why we’ve set a target to 
increase female representation across 
senior roles for the coming years. We 
are confident that we do not have any 
processes or practices which would 
see people being paid differently due to
their gender.

As of the 5th April 2017 payroll, our 
mean5 gender pay gap stood at 29.9% 
(mean being the average number when 

In line with the way in which we have 
to do so according to the regulations, 
we have organised our gender 

distribution by the quartile pie charts 
below, with each chart holding 219 
colleagues based on salary, correct 
as at the end of April 2016. Figures 
have been organised by splitting 
our colleague numbers equally into 
four parts. Female representation is 
actually positive in both our quartiles 
one and two; it’s in our upper quartiles 
where representation shows an 
imbalance. We know this, which is 
why we’re committed to increasing 
representation in these bands, and 
potentially exceeding our target of 
30%. We are definitely heading in the 
right direction but we know that work 
needs to be done. We’re pleased with 
the progress we’ve made so far.

Women in Finance and Gender Pay GapSeptember  2017We can see that the gap falls slightly 
below the predictions of PWC10 for 
financial services, which is positive, 
but above the average reported by 
the Office of National Statistics for all 
businesses (ONS) of 18.1%11 for full and 
part time employees. As a fair and equal 
employer, we’re proud to say that all 
permanent colleagues, irrespective of 
their position, age, gender or ethnicity, 
are eligible for bonuses. Discretionary 
bonuses are paid relative to company 
and individual performance on an 
annual basis. Bonuses are performance 
related and are rewarded based on a 
percentage of each colleague’s salary.
Our figures reflect the success and 
achievements of individuals in 2016 

and the fact we offer an equal chance 
for all our colleagues to receive a 
bonus; in fact 85% of both our male 
and female colleagues received a 
bonus in 2016 and there was no 
difference in those who were rewarded 
with bonuses. We are aware that 
there is a gap in our mean and median 
figures relating to bonuses. This is 
explained similarly to the reasons why 
we have a gender pay gap, due to the 
composition of our senior workforce 
and the fact that there are more 
male than female employees in this 
population whose bonus structures 
are different. The equality of our 
bonus pay structure is reflected in 
our median pay and median bonus 

figures which are of course based 
around an individual’s salary and their 
performance for that year.
Whilst we acknowledge we have a 
gender pay gap, we’re clear on why 
it exists and focused on the steps 
we need to take to close the gap we 
see today. Our targets for Women 
in Finance will play a key role in the 
steps we need to take to reduce our 
current pay gap by increasing the 
representation across our senior 
leadership team. The journey has 
started but we still have a way to go to 
get to where we need to be.

September  2017

We’ve definitely come a long way over the past year, but 
we know there’s still a considerable journey to go on. 
We’ve seen real commitment within the Bank to reach 
and potentially exceed the targets we’ve set by 2020, 
and it’s been exciting so far. We’ve taken significant 
steps made to increase female representation within 
our senior leadership population and beyond, with 
our unconscious bias training and the changes to our 
recruitment process. However, we know more needs 
to be done and we will continue to work towards the 
recommendations of the Charter and develop our 
own initiatives. Our aim is to ensure women are not 
only better represented within Aldermore but most 
importantly supported.

Conclusion

We’re well on track to meeting our 
Charter targets for 2020 and we have 
a clear plan to close our gender pay 
gap. There’s more that can be done 
and the Steering Committee we have 

established internally are working 
tirelessly to ensure that we’re making 
Aldermore a bank that is inclusive, 
diverse and an organisation people 
want to work for.
