As a company, we are committed to equality, diversity and inclusion and we appreciate initiatives that promote industry-wide transparency and awareness regarding equity and equal opportunity within the workplace. Hourly Rate      Mean  Difference in the average hourly pay for men compared to the average hourly 
pay for women in the organization.         Median  Difference between the midpoint of hourly earnings of men and the midpoint 
of hourly earnings of women.  It compares the middle most salary of each 
gender. The National 2017 Average (Median) in the UK is 18.4%.    Our report presents mean (average) and median (the midpoint) gender pay gap data. The mean gender pay gap refers to the difference between the average/median earnings of men and the average/median earnings of women working within our United Kingdom offices and facilities, without regard to the nature of the work being performed .  A gender pay gap is different from an equal pay comparison, which examines whether there is a difference in pay between men and women with similar qualifications and experience carrying out the same or comparable work. A gender pay gap does not equate to an equal pay issue. In many instances, a gender pay gap results from having fewer female employees and/or having fewer women in higher paid positions.  As with many other organizations in our industry, gender representation is a challenge in our core business, industrial and information solutions, and the industries that we serve. These industries are strongly male dominant. The predominant skill set and education required at Rockwell Automation, and in our industry, is engineering, and this extends to managerial and leadership roles.  Women remain in the gender minority in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) occupations. The 2017 Women in STEM Workforce Report published by wisecampaign.co.uk, indicates that only 11% of engineering professionals and 27% of science and engineering professionals are women, and the pipeline of future female talent is growing at an even slower pace. Hourly Rate   Pay Quartiles  Women to men proportion within each salary range, from lowest (Q1) to highest (Q4) quartile.      The gender distribution of our employees reflects this market reality.  As of April 5, 2017, Rockwell Automation UK facilities had just over 600 employees, which are covered by the report in line with the regulations, and women represented just over 19% of this population. We are committed to providing equal pay for equal work and we are confident that we pay our workers in the UK comparably by role, regardless of their gender. We review pay equity on an ongoing basis to ensure this is the case.   However, consistent with the industry demographics as a whole, men occupy more than 80% of the positions within our UK operation that are higher paid because they require an engineering or technology degree. This distribution within our workforce has led to the gender pay gap data reported. Rockwell Automation’s gender pay gap reflects the challenges faced across an industry that historically has attracted more men than women. As a company, we are committed to recruiting and retaining a more diverse workforce and creating an inclusive culture where everyone can and wants to do their best work. We strive to increase the number of women employed in all positions at our company and, as a result, reduce the gender pay gap over time. Bonus Pay Gap      Mean  Difference in the average bonus pay-out for men compared to the average bonus pay-out for women in the organization.        Median  Difference between the midpoint of bonus pay-out to men and the midpoint of bonus pay-out to women.  It compares the middle most bonus payout of each gender.   Bonus Pay Gap   Pay-out Distribution  Total number of men and women in the organization who received or exercised a bonus payout between April 6 2016 and April 5 2017.      We have been focused on increasing the diversity of our global workforce for many years.  We have made progress, as evidenced by Rockwell Automation’s receipt of the 2017 Catalyst Award, which honours innovative organizations that demonstrate proven, measurable results that address the recruitment, development and advancement of women. The company also works in partnership with Cook Ross Inc. to provide unconscious bias training to people managers globally, including the UK. Our diversity and inclusion efforts have produced successes that we are committed to building on globally, including within the UK.  Since 2007, Rockwell Automation, globally, has seen a 76% increase in the number of women at the executive level.  Since 2012, in our EMEA region we have increased our women directors by 126% and mid-level female managers by 38%.  During this same period, women representation in our EMEA sales and engineers population has increased by 83% and 19%, respectively In addition, the company is taking an active, leadership role in addressing the underlying reasons for gender imbalances in STEM occupations. Specific to the EMEA region, Rockwell Automation is committed to continuing current initiatives including FIRST ®, the EMEA Graduate Training Programme, and our Professional Women’s Council. We know there is more work to be done, and we continuously seek to expand and amplify our diversity and inclusion efforts and to increase the representation of women at all levels of our organization and within our industry. We confirm that the information and data reported are accurate and in line with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. Rockwell Automation is committed to the highest standards of ethics, integrity and compliance. Our culture of integrity is a pillar of our global success and one of the key reasons we have been a respected business leader for over a century. It is another reason why we have been named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies on numerous occasions. Find out more here .
