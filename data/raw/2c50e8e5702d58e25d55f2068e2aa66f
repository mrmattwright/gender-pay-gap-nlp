The Trust is committed to:   Eliminating unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation across all the protected characteristics*  Advancing equality of opportunity between different groups  Fostering good relations between different groups   *the protected characteristics are Age; Disability; Gender Reassignment; Race, Religion or Belief; Sex; Sexual Orientation; Pregnancy & Maternity; Marriage & Civil partnership.  To improve the patient experience we have a highly skilled, motivated and diverse workforce. This means that we are far and unbiased, and accept differences between individuals and value the benefits of diversity. This is demonstrated by the everyday practices, policies and procedures we adhere to. We aim to be pro-active in meeting the changing needs of our diverse communities and provide fair access for all in an environment where dignity and individuality are respected.  Equality and Diversity Vision and Goals   Equality and Diversity Objectives 2013/14  The Trust worked with Equality South West to undertake an independent audit to establish the effectiveness of our policies, procedures and practices in supporting our aim to promote inclusive behaviours, to respect and value differences, and ensure this is woven into the fabric of how the Trust operates through our values into practice.  The Trust’s equality and diversity objectives fall into four areas, with an underpinning action plan:   To embed the Equality Delivery System (EDS) through the Trust’s mainstream operations, business planning processes, procurement, and related activities.  To ensure the Trust’s information sources and systems capture and contain adequate data to inform operational and strategic decisions that will enable equity of access, service delivery and outcomes for patients and staff from protected groups.  To ensure our methods of communication, including our interpretation and translation provisions are accessible and meet the needs of our patients, carers, and staff.  To review how we currently engage with staff and our patients across the protected groups in order to identify gaps and ways to fill them.
