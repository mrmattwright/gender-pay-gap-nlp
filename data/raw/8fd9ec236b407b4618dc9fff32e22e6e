Introduction
• Comex 2000 (UK) Ltd has carried out a gender pay gap review and is publishing the report in line 

with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017

• The gender pay gap differs from equal pay:

• Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same 

jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.

• The gender pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women.

• We are committed to the principles of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees 

as well as sustaining a diverse workforce to enrich our company.

• We are working towards a policy of paying employees fairly and equally for the same or 

equivalent work through evaluating our pay grades and ensuring a fair structure on an ongoing 
basis.

What is the data telling us?

• On average, the males working in Comex 2000 have a hourly rate of pay which is 3.7% higher than females
• However the mid point difference in the hourly rate of pay is almost neutral with just a 0.7% differential
• The average bonus paid to males (over a 12 month period) is 48.7% higher compared to females. In value 

terms the difference is:

• Males mean bonus – £1,507
• Female mean bonus - £773

• The majority of employees, who are eligible for a bonus, are predominantly male and work as engineers.  

There are a number of bonus schemes in place for engineers e.g. Refer A Friend (to client services), Engineer 
of the Month, NPS etc which back office, predominantly female employees do not have access to.

• However, in comparison, the mid point bonus value (over a 12 month period) is slightly more favourable for 

females, -3.4%, in value terms this difference is:

• Males mid point bonus – £740
• Female mid point bonus - £765

• The percentage of men receiving a bonus payment (which is 65.1%) is lower than females (which is 79.1%)

• The vast majority of organisations have a gender pay gap, and we are pleased to be able to say that our gap 

compares favourably with that of other organisations, including those within our industry.

• The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 Office for National 

Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17.4% while in the Telecoms sector it 
is 16.1%.  Our mean gender pay gap, at 3.7%, is significantly lower than both that for the whole economy 
and that for our sector.

• The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 ONS ASHE figures) is 
18.4% while in our sector it is 15.9%.  At 0.7%, our median gender pay gap is significantly lower than both 
that for the whole economy and for our sector.

• The above indicates that we are not paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent roles 

rather that our gender pay gap exists due to the roles that men and women are performing within the 
company and the salaries that those roles attract.

Next Steps
What do we think are the main causes for the gender pay gap in Comex?
• Our workforce of 668, (for the period under review April 2016- April 2017) was a split of 625 

males and 43 females.  Of the 43 females only 2.3% worked in engineering roles and the 
remaining worked in back office administration support.

• There is an under-representation of women in management roles and in more highly paid areas, 

especially operational management and technical engineering roles.  Of the 43 females only 
13.9% of them are part of the management tier. 

Taking action to close the gap
• The engineering and telecommunications sector faces a huge shared challenge to inspire more 
girls to study STEM subjects and develop careers into technical skilled roles, which tend to be 
more highly paid. Only 9% of UK engineers are women and only 4% of engineering apprentices 
are females.
