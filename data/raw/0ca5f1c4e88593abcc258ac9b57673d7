What does equality and diversity mean to us?  Equality is about creating a fairer society where everyone can take part and have the opportunity to fulfil their potential and be the very best they can be.  Diversity is about recognising and valuing people’s differences for the benefit of all our patients, carers, patients’ representatives, members of the public, partner organisations, staff and job applicants.  Human rights are about making sure our patients and staff are safe in healthcare settings, have their privacy protected, and are treated fairly, with dignity and respect.  We are proud to be an organisation which celebrates equality, diversity and human rights. That’s why we aim to keep it at the very centre of what we do. Our unwavering dedication to equality and diversity in our workplace is also reflected in our policies and practices.   Our commitment to you  We make every effort to ensure that our services embrace the cultures, languages and individual needs of our service users. We work actively and in partnership with the local health and social care economy, to reduce inequalities in health  We want to help create a fairer society. To do this, we actively and passionately promote equality and good relations for our patients, carers, patients’ representatives, members of the public, partner organisations, staff and job applicants.  As part of our commitment to being a responsible employer we will strive to ensure that our workforce has the awareness and ability to meet the different needs of Bristol’s diverse and expanding population.  We are guided by the following 4 principles, which apply to everyone:  • Eliminating unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation, and the potential for any other kind of discriminatory behaviour not covered under the Equality Act (2010);  • promoting equality between people who share a personal characteristic that is protected by law, such as age, gender, and ethnic identity, and those who do not share it;  • developing good relations between people who have a personal characteristic that is protected by law and those who do not;  • treating people fairly, with respect and dignity, and as individuals.  We welcome, value and learn from the increasing diversity of our staff. We address any act of unfairness or unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation, and always aim to secure the best possible outcomes for all, without detriment to particular groups and within the available resources.
