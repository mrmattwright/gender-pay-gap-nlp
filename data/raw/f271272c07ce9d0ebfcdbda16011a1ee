Based on the Government’s methodology, PerfectHome’s mean gender pay gap is 11.3% 
Our median gender pay gap is 3.4%. 
 
Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that it is largely driven by the fact that there are more 
men in senior higher-paid roles within the business. This is because the business has retail, online 
and call centre functions.

More men than women have been paid a bonus simply because certain roles do not attract a bonus.

The above quartiles show the gender distribution across the Company with just over 200 colleagues 
in each quartile. 

I am confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. 

I confirm that the data reported is accurate.
