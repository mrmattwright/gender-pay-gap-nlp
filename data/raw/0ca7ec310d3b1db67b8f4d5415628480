For the reporting period the FDA had 27 employees (16 female employees and 11 male employees) and are therefore not legally obliged to publish our data.  The FDA is unequivocally committed to equality, we believe that the fact we have voluntarily chosen to publish our gender pay gap, even though as an employer with only 27 staff we are under no legal obligation to do so, proves this commitment. We are disappointed that our gender pay gap is larger than we expected it to be, but we believe that publishing our data is the right thing to do. Gender pay gap reporting is an important and ground-breaking step forward for equalities and in the future we would like to see more organisations like the FDA voluntarily publish their gender pay gap.
