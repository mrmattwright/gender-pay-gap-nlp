Creating a diverse and inclusive culture is core to our values.  We welcome this UK government reporting requirement which brings sharper focus to gender pay and the need to improve national gender equality so individuals can achieve their full potential.  In the UK, we employ approximately 5,000 people. We have opted to report on total UK figures for all employees across all our UK legal entities to provide a comprehensive view, not solely the legal entities covered by the mandatory reporting requirement.
