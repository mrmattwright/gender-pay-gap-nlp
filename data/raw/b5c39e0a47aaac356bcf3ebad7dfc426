As a small organisation, Ffilm Cymru Wales has voluntarily published its report, which was calculated through the government’s Gender Pay Gap Reporting Service. At a time when women are under-represented in business and the creative sector, Ffilm Cymru Wales has a gender pay gap of 20% in favour of women, with 67% of staff members in the Upper Pay Quartile identifying as a woman. While not noted by the Gender Pay Gap Reporting Service, Ffilm Cymru Wales also demonstrates 50/50 gender parity on its Board of Directors. Ffilm Cymru Wales aims to advance a sustainable and inclusive film culture that works for everyone across Wales, and will continue to lead on promoting gender equality in the film sector and beyond.
