& Resorts has become one of the UK's best-loved hotel companies
with over 40 premium hotel sites across the UK, Spain and Portugal.
We value the diversity of our workforce, and believe that the best
results are achieved by committed people from a variety of
different backgrounds, ethnicities and gender.  We are committed to the principle of equal opportunities and
equal treatment for all employees and are therefore confident that
the gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women
differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather the gender pay
gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within
the company and the salaries that these roles attract in the labour
market.  This report provides details of the gender pay gap for Macdonald
Hotels Limited and Macdonald Resorts Limited, both of which have
more than 250 employees.     VIEW OUR GENDER PAY GAP
