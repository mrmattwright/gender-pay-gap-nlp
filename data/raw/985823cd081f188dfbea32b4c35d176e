At Concorde Logistics we are confident that men and women are paid equally when working in equivalent roles and we welcome the introduction of gender pay gap reporting.  At the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, the overall difference between average male and female earnings is 0.7% (mean) in favour of women or 2.7% (median) in favour of men, based on hourly rates of pay.  Whilst our gap is tiny compared with the UK average of 18.1%, we don’t want to be complacent.  Our gender pay gap is heavily influenced by the fact that our business is almost entirely male. Concorde, like many logistics companies, has been traditionally male dominated.  We know that there are few women in our business today; our aim is to recruit more women and to ensure that there is an opportunity for them to progress and to reach their full potential. We have been actively working on this; it is not only the right thing to do, it also makes good economic sense. Research shows that companies that have greater gender diversity are also more likely to show better financial results.  I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate.
