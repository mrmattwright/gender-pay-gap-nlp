Lambeth Council’s gender pay gap report shows that men are paid 4.83 per cent more than women, which remains below the parity level the authority is determined to achieving. The percentage shows the level at which men are paid more than women based on the mean hourly rate. Using the median hourly rate as a measure the gender pay gap at Lambeth Council is 4.75 per cent.  Lambeth’s gender pay gap rate is narrower than the national local authority average difference in mean hourly rate of 5.4 per cent, and less than half the 12.3 per cent reported for organisations from all sectors. However Lambeth council remains committed to do more when it comes to bridging the divide.  The underlying reason is that while there are more women than men at all levels in the council, there are more women than men in the lower quartiles. Addressing this distribution of gender roles is key in bridging the gap.  These figures have been published in line with gender pay reporting legislation which requires employers with 250 or more employees, to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. Lambeth Council does not have a bonus scheme.  The information is provided in compliance with the gender pay gap reporting duty (Equality Act 2010 Gender Pay Gap Information Regulations 2017 (S1 2017/172)).
