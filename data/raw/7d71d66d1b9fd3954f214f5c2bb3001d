We recognise and value the opportunity we have as an employer to continue to effect real change both within our firm and across the wider industry in addressing the social and cultural challenges that have driven historic gender inequality.  We also recognise that Gender Pay relates to the difference between pay for men and women across the total workforce: this differs from Equal Pay which compares rates of pay for the same job role, or work of equal value. For over 100 years Kreston Reeves has been an equal opportunity employer offering equal pay, terms and conditions to all employees as standard - knowing that our people make us who we are. Our report is based on a snapshot taken on 5 April 2017, a few months after the merger of Kreston Reeves and Spofforths, prior to harmonisation of the firm.
