Have a look                            Kind words from some of our families Read Below   For R this was an awesome week doing activities that were just right for him and things he really wanted to do. It was lovely for him to be doing things he wanted to do with the support that made them fun and accessible, reducing his anxiety. To be away from the difficulties of school interaction with all the problems it brings him I think really helped his self-esteem. It was great that he got picked to do the experiment at the Gunpowder mills!   From Fiona  (parent of a 10 year old on summer play scheme in London)        Kind words from some of our families Read Below   I would just like to take this opportunity to let you know how impressed we are with the Resources for Autism team. S is enjoying the playscheme at Cannon Hill House this week. This is the first time S has attended such provision and as he is a non-verbal child with challenging behaviour we were slightly anxious about how he would cope with a new environment. These worries were put to rest at the home visit when it was clear that Gina had an excellent understanding of autism along with triggers, prevention and solutions to melt downs. All of the staff we have had contact with have been friendly, professional and knowledgeable and above all so positive!   From Lisa  (the parent of a child attending our under 8’s scheme in Birmingham)        Kind words from some of our families Read Below   I just wanted to say, what an amazing week L has had at Northfield Playscheme this week, Monday was a bit touchy for her, as things were very different to her Saturday club, but every morning when she knew where she was going she sang and chirped all the  way, Mark and his team are AMAZING , L had Ceri for the week and the bond between them now is incredible, but I watched all the staff with their assorted young people and they are the ‘cream of the crop’. Whoever their manager is he/she should be very proud of them and what they achieved.   From Janet  (the parent of an 18 year old attendee at Summer Scheme)        Kind words from some of our families Read Below   Mollie helped J so much and for this we are truly grateful. J has been really happy and it gave the family some respite and J was able to experience things on her own, able to have fun and go places. I wish it was more than 6 months!
