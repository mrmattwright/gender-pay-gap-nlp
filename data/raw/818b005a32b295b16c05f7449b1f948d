GENDER PAY GAP 2017

At Jet2.com and Jet2holidays we recognise that a diverse workforce enables us 
to  provide  a  richer  and  more  fulfilling  working  environment  for  all  colleagues 
irrespective of gender or any other aspect of diversity. 
Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, believe in a culture that promotes diversity and equal opportunity for all colleagues. 
We recognise the benefits of a diverse workforce to ensure we attract and retain the best people for the job, 
supporting and delivering high performance and increasing the Company’s reputation within the wider community 
and industry. 
The figures within this report are based on the snapshot date of 5th April 2017. On this date 53.3% of colleagues 
were male and 46.7% were female.

Under  new  laws,  all  employers  in  the  UK  with  250 
or  more  employees  must  now  report  figures  based 
on statutory calculations. The Gender Pay report for 
Jet2.com and Jet2holidays provides a snapshot view 
of  the  gender  balance  and  aims  to  capture  the  gap 
in earnings of all colleagues irrespective of their role, 
department or seniority.

The higher gender pay and bonus gaps within Jet2.com (our Leisure Airline) are heavily influenced by the salaries and 
gender of its Pilot and Engineering teams who earn relatively high salaries compared to other Jet2.com colleagues, and 
the large number of Cabin Crew colleagues who are traditionally female and on a lower pay scale.
Within Jet2holidays the gender split is more equal throughout the different business areas and levels of position and there 
are a significant number of senior female colleagues.
We have recently announced that from April 2018, we will share 5% of profit under a Discretionary Colleague Profit Sharing 
Scheme. This Scheme is intended to reward all eligible colleagues who do not already participate in a performance related 
bonus or commission scheme.
We are working across both Jet2.com and Jet2holidays to continue to focus on female representation at a senior level 
through our talent and succession programmes.

Summary

We are confident that whilst we are presented with a large gender pay gap that this is not an equal pay issue.
At Jet2.com and Jet2holidays we are confident that both men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our 
business. The gap predominantly stems from having fewer females in certain roles such as within our Pilot and Engineering 
Community.
