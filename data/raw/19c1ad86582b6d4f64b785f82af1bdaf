At St Austell Brewery we are committed to fairness, equality and inclusion and to reducing our gender pay gap.               We are confident that we offer equal pay for equal work across the St Austell Brewery business and in all roles. However, there is a 21% mean gender pay gap at St Austell Brewery which reflects a gender imbalance in certain types of role within the company. St Austell Brewery is committed to nurturing talent across our business and to creating as wide and diverse a workforce as possible. The nature of St Austell Brewery’s business encompasses a managed and tenanted pub estate and brewery along with the distribution of beers, wines and spirits. Head office and support functions include finance, HR, marketing, sales, IT and property maintenance. On the 31 st March 2017 St Austell Brewery employed 1,451 people. Of that total, 586 were female and 865 were male, a 40/60 female-male ratio.                         THE DIFFERENCE    Our 60/40 male-female employee ratio is influenced by a high proportion of male workers in certain roles; for example, brewing and distribution roles requiring manual labour have traditionally attracted more male applicants as have chef roles in pubs and hotels.  Within the managed pub estate however, the male-female employee ratio is more balanced at 53/47. The 21% mean gender pay gap reflects the higher proportion of males employed in roles mentioned above as well as in upper quartile and middle quartile roles in the head office and support functions. Among employees who receive a bonus, the median gender bonus pay gap is 0%. In 2017, female employees entitled to a bonus received 17.73% more than their male counterparts which is shown in the median gender bonus pay gap figure. This is reflective of higher bonuses earned by female managers in the company’s pub estate.         CLOSING THE GAP    Our ambition is to close the gap and, to achieve this, we are committed to implementing new initiatives to improve how we attract, engage and develop women across our business, as well as other under-represented groups, to create a truly diverse workforce which reflects the communities we serve. We aim to ensure fairness and consistency across all our policies and processes to support this, including recruitment, development, promotion and reward.         TERMINOLOGY    WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THE GENDER PAY GAP? The gender pay gap is calculated by taking the hourly pay rate of all women and the hourly rate of all men in our business, finding the mean and median and then determining the gap between these numbers across genders.  WHAT IS THE MEAN DIFFERENCE? Mean difference is calculated by adding up the wages of our male employees then dividing that total by the number of male employees. We then repeat the same calculation for our female employees and the difference between the two sums creates the mean pay gap figure between men and women.  WHAT IS THE MEDIAN DIFFERENCE? Median difference is calculated by looking at the pay rates from lowest to highest for men and picking out the figure in the middle. The same is then done for women and the difference between the two figures creates the median pay gap between men and women.               PINTS PRODUCED SINCE
