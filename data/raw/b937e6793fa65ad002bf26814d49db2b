The gender 
pay gap report 
2017

Measuring the pay gap 

This report sets out the gender pay gap at Water Plus, the reasons for it and the steps we 
are taking to close it.  The law requires any company with more than 250 employees to 
publish its gender pay gap. 
The gender pay gap is the difference between the pay of men and women working for 
an organisation. The report shows the difference in the average hourly earnings of men 
and women across our business. The statistics can be affected by a range of factors, 
including the different number of men and women across all roles. 
The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. Equal pay requires that men and women 
must be paid the same for doing equivalent work. We pay men and women the same 
rates for performing the same roles. The reason for this difference in average pay for our 
male and female employees is explained in this report.

There are two ways of 
measuring the pay gap:
1. Median pay gap 

The median represents the middle point of a population. If you lined up all the women at a 
company and all the men, the median pay gap is the difference between the hourly rate of 
pay for the middle woman compared to the hourly rate of pay for the middle man.

2. Mean pay gap 

The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly rate of pay for 
women, compared to the average hourly rate of pay for men.

Our mean gender pay gap is 16.7%

Our median gender pay gap is 17.5%

Both our mean and median pay gap are below the national average. We remain  
committed to the ongoing work required to reduce the gap further. 

We have divided our workforce into four quartiles: the lower, lower middle, 
upper middle and upper quartile, pay bands.

We have a higher proportion of women at lower levels within our organisation. 
Within our upper middle quartile, we have more men (55%) than women (45%) in 
professional, specialist roles and more women (63%) in customer service type roles,  
which attract lower salaries in the market. 
We have good representation across our Team Leaders where over half are women. 
We have a near-even gender split at senior level with 43% female representation at 
Executive level including our CEO.

There is also a gender gap between the bonuses paid to our 
male and female employees. 
• Mean gender bonus gap 34.6%
• Median gender bonus gap is 31.8%
Our bonus gap is mainly due to the very small proportion of the workforce eligible 
for a bonus in the reporting period (under 5%). There is a much higher proportion 
of men than women working in this part of the business. We are actively recruiting 
to address this imbalance. 

Our plan to close the gap…

Our people, and their personal 
approach, is what sets us 
apart from our competitors, 
so recruiting and retaining 
the right people is key to our 
success. Closing the gender 
pay gap is part of this stratergy 
and we plan to do this by:

Continuing to encourage and appoint talented women to leadership roles to 
act as role models within the business and ensure a strong gender balance at 
executive level.
Developing robust metrics to measure and track the diversity of our business 
including further work on our talent strategy. 
Developing our direct external recruitment practices to attract and retain more 
women especially into professional roles and to benchmark our reward packages. 
Reviewing all sales incentive packages to ensure fairness and remove any 
unconscious bias. 
Continuing to develop our flexible working practices at all levels to allow 
employees to balance their responsibilities with personal commitments. 
Developing our strong commitment to professional qualifications and education to 
ensure a strong, diverse pipeline of talent including our first line management 
development programme.
