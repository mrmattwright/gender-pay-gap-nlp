The six key metrics are:   The difference in the mean pay of full-pay men and women, expressed as a percentage  The difference in the median pay of full-pay men and women, expressed as a percentage  The difference in mean bonus pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage  The difference in median bonus pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage  The proportion of men and women who received bonus pay  The proportion of full-pay men and women in each of four quartile pay bands   Calculations from data taken as at 5 April 2017 are considered to be accurate and are as follows:     Mean gender pay gap  Median gender pay gap  Mean bonus gender pay gap  Median bonus gender pay gap  Proportion of males receiving a bonus  Proportion of females receiving a bonus    11.4%  6.3%  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a          Proportion of staff in each quartile      Lower quartile  Lower middle quartile  Upper middle quartile  Upper quartile    Male  40%  26%  43%  56%    Female  60%  74%  57%  44%       It is important to note that “gender pay gap” is different to “equal pay” which is the difference between men and women who carry out similar jobs. Stewarts is committed to equal pay for work of equal value and supports the fair treatment and reward of all staff irrespective of gender.
