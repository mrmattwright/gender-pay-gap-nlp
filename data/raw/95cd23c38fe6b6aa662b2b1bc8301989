GENDER PAY GAP REPORT  2017

This report details our 2017 results and our drive towards 

reducing our gender pay gap.  

INTRODUCTION

Driving diversity
At Volkswagen Group we believe in job opportunities  
for everyone. 

We’re committed to building a diverse team and celebrating all 
the creativity, innovation and bright ideas this brings. 
It’s all about attracting and retaining the best people for the 
job, and we’ve taken significant steps to drive a more gender-
balanced workforce at every level, and continue to do so. 
Independent research shows that companies with a more 
diverse workforce have higher levels of performance.

We have a relentless focus on driving diversity, including 
addressing gender representation and supporting women in  
the workplace.  
And key to this is our #DrivenWomen programme, set up to 
promote gender diversity and inclusion by finding, developing 
and retaining women across the business, and supporting them 
to reach their full potential.

DEFINITION

What is the gender pay gap?
When discussing the pay gap it’s important to define what we’re looking at. 

Median pay gap 

Imagine we split our employees by gender, arranging men and women in two lines in order of pay from highest  
to lowest. The median gender pay gap compares the hourly pay of the woman in the middle of 
the female line with the hourly pay of the man in the middle of the male line.
The most common reason for a gap is that there are more men in senior roles than women.  
Seniority and hierarchy drive the difference.

Mean pay gap 

The mean gender pay gap, on the other hand, shows the difference in the average hourly rate of 
pay between men and women in a company. 
As with the median gender pay gap, the mean pay gap is often because there are more men than 
women in senior roles in the company.

Bonus gap

These median and mean calculations are also carried out when comparing bonuses paid over a 
twelve month period.

Equal pay 

Both median and mean pay gaps are different from ‘equal pay’, which is the difference in pay between men and women doing the 
same or similar jobs – 'i.e. equal pay for equal jobs'. The gender pay gap measures the difference in pay regardless of role and can be 
influenced by the different number of men and women in the organisation across all roles.  An equal pay analysis on the other hand 
considers two employees or groups of employees carrying out the same, similar or equivalent roles.

WHAT IT ALL MEANS 

Our results in focus
Our gender pay gap is driven by the fact that although  
42 per cent of employees in our organisation are women,  
we have more men in more senior roles. 

On the other hand, our own internal analysis shows that our 
equal pay gap is less than one per cent.  

We work hard to maintain pay equality for equivalent jobs 
– following strict processes like our annual pay review and 
pay principles; and performing regular checks to ensure our 
policies and practices are fair to all. 

Where bonuses are paid, they are based on several factors, 
including grade, personal and company performance. 
The bonus pay gap is influenced in a similar way to the median 
pay gap. The gap exists because we have more men than women 
in higher grades.

#DrivenWomen
At the start of 2015, Volkswagen Group set up a working group to 
examine gender balance across our business. 

We know that when organisations have a truly diverse workforce, 
they are more creative, innovative, more aligned to customer 
needs and ultimately more successful. 
Over the past two years, our working group has grown into a wide-
reaching #DrivenWomen programme.

The programme aims to inspire young women from schools, 
colleges and through apprenticeships to consider a career in the 
automotive industry. It is also helping create an environment at 
Volkswagen Group in which women are supported, encouraged 
and developed to take on more senior roles.

We’ve also invested in raising awareness of the need for gender 
diversity across the Group through a variety of initiatives, including 
training, mentoring, new recruitment techniques and the 
implementation of more flexible working practices.

The 30% Club

Volkswagen Group is an active member of 
the Automotive 30% Club, a voluntary group 
of progressive motor industry CEOs and 
MDs who are working to achieve a better 
gender balance in their organisations. 

The club has an aspirational aim to fill 30 per 
cent of key leadership positions with women 
by 2030. 

We’ve gone further than that, with a target of 
30 per cent female representation in senior 
management by 2021.

LOOKING AHEAD 

Our focus and key strategies
This is what we’ll be working on to make sure the momentum is maintained as we drive towards reducing the 
gender gap…

Inspire

Develop

Attract

•  Engaging with young people aged 11 to 16, and promoting our ‘On the Road’ programme for 

16- to 25-year-olds.

•  Using outreach programmes to educate girls about the range of jobs available in automotive 

– a sector which has traditionally been seen as ‘male’.

conscious and unconscious bias supported by essential development for our line managers. 

•  Exploring new ways for people to work flexibly, and ensuring they have targeted training and 

development. Supporting people returning to our business after family leave and ensuring 
talent doesn’t go to waste.

•  Encouraging people to take control of and develop their careers.
