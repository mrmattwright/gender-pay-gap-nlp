Gender Pay Gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women within our organisation, expressed relative to men’s earnings.  The Gender Pay Gap is a different measure from the Equal Pay Statistics, which measure the difference in remuneration between male and female employees doing the same job.    In accordance with the regulations, certain statistics are published on the government’s online reporting service as well as within this report, and include the following:      Mean Gender Pay Gap : the difference in the mean  hourly rate of pay between male and female employees    Median Gender Pay Gap : the difference in the median  hourly rate of pay between male and female employees    Mean Bonus Pay Gap : the difference in the mean  bonus pay between male and female employees    Median Bonus Pay Gap : the difference in the median bonus pay between male and female employees    Proportion of men and women receiving bonus pay    Proportions of male and female employees in each of four equal pay quartiles    Please see the document below for the full report.
