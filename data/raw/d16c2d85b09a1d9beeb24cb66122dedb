Gender Pay Gap           We are required by UK legislation to publish our Gender Pay Gap by 30 th March 2018. The report below is to be published on our Public Facing Website:     Gender Pay Gap report     The headline figures appear on the Government website .  The data (as at 30.03.17) that we are required to publish is:    The mean gender pay gap which is the difference between the average male and female hourly rate of pay (including enhancements but excluding overtime)   The median gender pay gap which is the difference between the median of male and female hourly rates   The same data for bonus payments together with a comparison of the percentages of men and women receiving a bonus.   The percentage of males and females in each of our quartiles of pay.   As an organisation we welcome the opportunity to understand our gender pay gap and therefore identify positive actions to reduce the gap.       Please see our FAQs below for more information:      What is the gender pay gap?    The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average rates of pay for men and women across a whole workforce.  It reflects broad trends in employment and salaries at an organisation, rather than comparing individuals. It’s not the same as equal pay, which is the legal requirement to pay men and women the same rate for the same or similar work. Across the UK, men earned 18.4% more than women in April 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure is calculated on a 1% sample of employees' jobs. It takes the median average for men and women, which is the level of pay that half of people earn more than, and half earn less than.      Why are organisations required to publish this data?     All UK companies with 250 or more employees will have to publish their gender pay gap data by April 2018, under a new legal requirement. For public sector organisations , including NHS Trusts, the deadline is 30 March 2018.   Public, private and voluntary sector firms are now all required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses.   Employers also have the option to include a narrative with their calculations. This would explain the reasons for the results, and give details about actions they are taking to tackle the gender pay gap.      What is our mean and median gender pay gap?    The mean gender pay gap is 29% and the median gender pay gap is 16% suggesting the pay differential is skewed in the upper quartile. In reality, there are fewer women in the most highly paid staff group, although they make up over 70% of the workforce      What is the gender pay gap for bonus payments (Clinical Excellence Awards)?    The mean gender pay gap for bonus payments is 24% and the median gender pay gap is 50%. NHS Employers have advised that the only payment that constitute a bonus are national and local Clinical Excellence Awards. Since this is only payable to around 700 medical consultants, just 0.72% of the whole female workforce are in receipt of this and 6.85% of the whole male workforce.      What is the distribution of males and females in each quartile of our hourly pay rate?    The gender gap is principally driven by differences in the upper quartile including a higher proportion of men in this workforce and higher rates of pay for men in the most senior or most highly paid roles – these include Board level Directors, Clinical Directors and Medical Consultants.      What actions is the Trust taking to reduce the gender pay gap?     The Trust will:   provide the right support and opportunities for the increasing number of women entering the medical profession to move into consultant roles.   ensure that women are encouraged and supported to apply to become Consultants and senior managers. More use of flexible working will help with this.   require that all recruitment panels are always gender balanced.   explore any barriers to women entering leadership or consultant positions, and actively encourage applications for leadership roles through mentoring and leadership development.   proactively encourage female applications for Trust Board and senior roles to work towards 50/50 Board representation.   use ideas and feedback from women employed by the Trust to shape our plans, strategies and policies.   develop a clear strategy to ensure inclusivity and diversity across all of our protected characteristic groups driven by a new Diversity Board from April 2018 , which will be chaired by the Chief Executive.    Recruitment – The Trust will:     continue to roll out Unconscious Bias training to ensure all managers involved in recruitment are aware of their hidden prejudices and can address these.   aim to recruit people from diverse backgrounds using targeted marketing and positive engagement with local communities to encourage applications.   ensure the Graduate Management Training scheme alumni describe their own career progression to help ensure a strong female pipeline. 67% of those appointed via recent schemes were female.    Retention – The Trust will:     support all staff but particularly women in middle grade roles to pursue flexible working options, if this will help retain them in the Trust.   expand existing health and well-being strategies  to address the particular challenges faced by women in the workplace and also help managers to better understand how to provide appropriate support.    Education, Training and Development – The Trust will:   utilise all opportunities to create and fund development activities,  including the  apprenticeship levy, to help support career progression.   expand succession planning and talent management strategies to expose staff to experiences to help support career progression, including secondments, work shadowing, coaching and mentoring.        Is gender pay the same as equal pay?    No. Equal Pay is not the same as the gender pay gap.  Legislation has been in place since 1970 (the Equal Pay Act) to make it illegal to pay a person of one gender (usually a woman) less than a person of another gender (usually a man) for carrying out the same or a similar work.  The gender pay gap analyses the various of components of pay, e.g. hourly rates and bonuses, across all men and women in the same organisation to identify the median and mean gaps.  A gender pay gap does not necessarily mean that pay rates for men and women for the same or similar jobs is not the same.      Why is there a gender pay gap nationally?    There's no one reason behind the gender pay gap - it's a complex issue.  The Fawcett Society , a group which campaigns for equality, says caring responsibilities can play a big part. Women often care for young children or elderly relatives. This means women are more likely to work in part-time roles, which are often lower paid or have fewer opportunities for progression.  Another important factor is a divided labour market. Women are still more likely to work in lower-paid and lower-skilled jobs. Women currently make up 62% of those earning less than the living wage, according to the Living Wage Foundation .  Discrimination is another cause of the gender pay gap. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (ECHR) has previously found that one in nine new mothers were either dismissed, made redundant or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their job. This can create a gap in experience, leading to lower wages when women return to work.  Men also tend to take up the majority of the most senior roles at a company, which are the highest paid.      Can companies be punished for a wide gender pay gap?    Companies can't be punished for a wide gender pay gap, but they might be punished for failing to publish their data, or for publishing inaccurate or misleading figures.  The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for ensuring employers publish their pay gap figures.  The EHRC says it will approach employers informally at first, but businesses could ultimately face "unlimited fines and convictions".
