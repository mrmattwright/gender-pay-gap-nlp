We pride ourselves on the quality of our care, our range of services and the quality of our consultants and staff, who we believe to be the very best in their profession.  Although we provide acute private healthcare services, our charitable status is based on the fact that we utilise surplus funds to run St John’s Hospice, located within the grounds of the Hospital. This inpatient, day care and community facility provides care, without charge, to people living within our wide catchment area.  Both the Hospital and the Hospice take great pride in their heritage, and especially in the Catholic ethos upon on which they were founded which assures patients of a commitment to care and compassion in the delivery of their healthcare. The aim of both institutions is the same now as it was over 160 years ago — to provide the highest quality health care for all those who seek it.  Field Marshal the Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, GCB LVO OBE DL, – The Hospital Chairman          Our Values         Responsibility   Be responsible to our community in which we live and work, by maintaining and managing an infrastructure that protects the environment and natural resources through competent management, whose actions are just and equitable.          Charity   Be committed to providing for the future, by maintaining reasonable prices in order to make a fair surplus, securing funding from an increased range of sources to meet current service requirements and enable future service developments, and by striving to reduce costs, thus allowing us to support the good work of our main charitable beneficiary, St John’s Hospice.          Excellence   Be responsible to our customers and staff for the safe delivery of high quality healthcare services through effective and efficient administration, robust risk management and governance principles, delivered by staff who are valued as individuals, treated with respect and dignity, and with a caring, compassionate ethos.          Innovation   Be committed to continuously improving our systems and services, to ensure that they are appropriate to support decision-making and provide a simple interface with our customers.          Compassion   We will strive to create a welcoming, peaceful and personal atmosphere of care in all of our services.               "All profits from the Hospital fund St John's Hospice, keeping its vital services running, which provide free care for over 3,000 terminally ill patients and their families each year."
