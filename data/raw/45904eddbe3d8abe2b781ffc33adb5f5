Camelot UK 
Gender pay gap reporting 2017

About Camelot UK
Camelot UK comprises two limited 
companies – Camelot UK Lotteries 
Limited (CUKL) and Camelot 
Business Solutions Limited (CBSL). 

CUKL is the operator of the UK 
National Lottery. Its overarching 
objective is to maximise returns to 
Good Causes through selling lottery 
products in an efficient and socially-
responsible way. This involves 
creating, marketing and promoting 
new games, developing and running 
the lottery infrastructure, providing 
services for players and winners, and 
working in partnership with retailers.

CBSL provides corporate 
support services – such as public 
relations, finance, procurement, 
legal, propriety, facilities 
management, and HR.

Camelot UK’s gender pay gap reporting
As of April 2017, CUKL employed 638 members of staff and CBSL employed 78 – so CUKL 
is currently the only Camelot UK company required to publish its gender pay gap figures 
on the official Government website (as it is the only Camelot UK company with over 250 
employees). However, we want to be as open and transparent as possible, and feel it is 
important that we provide a full picture of our UK workforce and gender pay gap figures. 

We are already taking material steps to reduce our gender pay gaps and promote gender 
diversity at all levels across both companies, and are now introducing further measures  
to lessen the gaps.

Camelot’s gender pay gap analysis

When analysing our gender pay gap figures, 
the first and most important fact we 
established is that men and women at Camelot 
are paid equally for equal work. All roles at 
Camelot are benchmarked for grading and 
salary purposes, against an independent 
source of general industry pay data. So, 
pay disparity is not a contributory factor.

Our gender pay gaps are primarily driven 
by the gender mix of our employees. 
Looking at the figures, it’s quite clear that, 

for CUKL in particular, there are more 
women in the lower-paid job grades and 
more men in the higher-paid job grades. 

male – so this obviously has an effect on 
the overall figures, as part-time employees 
are paid a lower, pro-rata salary.

There are a variety of reasons for this.  
For example, the fact that our Contact 
Centre offers part-time roles with specific 
shift patterns has proved very attractive to 
working mothers. In fact, there are 81 part-
time employees (excluding non-permanent 
or fixed-term contract employees) within 
CUKL and CBSL, and only eight of them are 

The gap is also greater in certain departments. 
For example, the majority of CUKL’s IT team 
is male (82% men vs. 18% women) but, in 
contrast, there are more women in our HR 
team (88% women vs. 12% men), which sits 
in CBSL. It’s also important to note that, for 
CBSL, there are more women than men in 
the highest-paid positions in the company.

Camelot UK’s gender pay gap action plan

To address the current gender pay and bonus gaps for both CUKL and CBSL, we have already implemented 
a number of measures and will be introducing further initiatives over the coming months.

What we’re already doing:
Flexible working 
Our aim is to balance the needs of our 
individual employees with the needs of the 
business. We recognise that many employees 
balance work commitments with those 
outside of the workplace and, as such, we 
carefully consider all applications for flexible 
working to enable this. We’ve also invested 
in technology to help our employees to work 
more flexibly and keep them connected, 
even if they are not physically in the office.
Benchmarking 
As already mentioned, all roles at Camelot are 
benchmarked for grading and salary purposes, 
against an independent source of general 
industry pay data. This ensures that the pay 
scales for all roles are based on objective  
criteria to enable consistency of measurement.
Maternity bonus 
We have a long-standing policy of welcoming 
back our employees who have been on 
maternity leave with a ‘Maternity Returner’s 
Bonus’.  It’s important to us that our returning 
mothers are supported during this important 
transition back into the workplace.

What we will be doing:
Progression for women 
We have actively started to analyse in closer 
detail how we can continue to engage and 
encourage women to apply for positions at 
Camelot – particularly in more senior roles – 
as well as how we can continue to grow and 
retain the female employees we already have.
Balanced shortlists 
We are looking to introduce a requirement 
for gender-balanced shortlists in our 
recruitment process for certain roles 
– particularly at senior levels.
Unconscious bias training 
We will be introducing unconscious bias 
awareness and training sessions, initially for 
those managers who are at the forefront of 
recruiting new employees into the business. 
This is to encourage recruitment into roles 
based on the skills and capabilities of the 
candidate alone, and to best support hiring 
managers with the tools that underpin this.

Coaching and mentoring 
We currently run an internal coaching 
programme and, over the next 12 months, we 
will be incorporating more active support for 
women to further nurture their professional 
development within the organisation. In 
addition to this, we will look at providing 
greater structured support through dedicated 
coaches for those about to go on, and those 
who are returning from, maternity leave.  
Women and leadership 
We will be inviting employees to have two-
way conversations with female leaders and 
role models – with the aim of raising the 
profile of senior women in the workplace, and 
encouraging more women into managerial 
and senior roles. These women will be a 
mixture of our existing employees, as well 
as external guests who we think will inspire 
our employees through what they have 
achieved throughout their careers.

We are fully committed to improving on this year’s figures, but know that any 
meaningful shift will take time. We will publish our 2018 gender pay and bonus 
gap figures in early 2019 and, as part of that, will update on our progress and 
detail any new actions that we will be carrying out to further reduce the gaps.

Nigel Railton, CEO, Camelot UK said: 
“Although we are very confident that women and men at Camelot are paid 
equally for equal work, we know that there is some way to go in reducing 
our gender pay and bonus gaps. We have already implemented a number 
of measures and will be introducing further initiatives over the coming 
months – starting with looking at how we better promote and mentor 
our existing female employees. We are fully committed to improving 
on these figures, but know that any meaningful shift will take time.”
