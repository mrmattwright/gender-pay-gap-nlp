2017 GENDER PAY GAP

At Shepherd and Wedderburn we are committed to fostering an inclusive culture 
because we believe our clients, colleagues and business are best served by a 
diverse workforce, with the multiplicity of experiences, ideas and perspectives this 
brings.
The process that has led to the publication of our 
gender pay gap report has been instructive and 
will feed into the many initiatives already underway 
at the firm to advance gender equality, increase 
transparency and further enhance our meritocratic 
culture. 

We are striving to promote diversity and inclusion 
within our organisation because we firmly believe 
this is the right thing to do. As part of that, we have 
established a Gender Focus Group representing 
colleagues at all levels as part of our wider diversity 
and inclusion strategy, S+W Together.

As a result of feedback from the Gender Focus 
Group, we will:
 ▪

undertake a survey of all colleagues this year 
to identify and address any professional and 
personal barriers that may exist;
provide training to all our managers on inclusive 
leadership and tackling unconscious bias; 
further develop our approach to one-to-one 
mentoring programmes to support colleagues in 
fulfilling their potential; and
continue to invest in Modern Apprentices and 
quality training within our Management Services 
Division.

On the date this snapshot was taken (5 April 2017), 
of our 185 lawyers and trainees, 105 were women 
and 80 were men. Of our 216 management and 
support service colleagues, there were 171 women 
and 45 men. 

Having analysed the figures underlying our pay 
gap, we are confident that all of our employees 
are paid fairly, regardless of gender. We believe 
the existence of a gender pay gap is largely due 
to the high percentage of female employees in 
management and support services roles within 
the firm, and this is likely to be the case across the 
legal sector. When we examined the pay of lawyers 
in isolation, the mean pay gap between men and 
women was 2.33%.

Turning to our bonus gap, we believe this is 
exacerbated by two factors: the proportion of 
women in part-time roles (21%) whose bonus is 
calculated by reference to their pro-rated salary; 
and the fact that only 6% of our management and 
support services employees are based in London, 
where colleagues receive a salary weighting.

Gender pay gap is calculated in two ways: the mean – the difference between the average of men’s and women’s hourly pay;  
and median figure – the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of men’s and women’s hourly pay.
