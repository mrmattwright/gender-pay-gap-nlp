 

Gender Pay Gap Reporting 

 

Why 
 
Aside from complying with legislation on gender pay gap reporting for legal entities with more than 250 employees 
fairness, inclusion and equal opportunity are at the heart of our values thus gathering and reporting on gender 
pay gap information and making it transparent demonstrates our commitment to establish our own benchmark 
and to see where action to close the gender pay gap is most needed.

Mandatory Data 
 
Based on the requisite snapshot of March 31st, 2017 the following data is reported on: 
 

•  Our mean gender pay gap (full-pay relevant employees)  
•  Our median gender pay gap (full-pay relevant employees) 
•  Our mean bonus gender pay gap (relevant employees) 
•  Our median bonus gender pay gap (relevant employees) 
•  Our proportion of males receiving a bonus payment (relevant employees) 
•  Our proportion of females receiving a bonus payment (relevant employees) 
•  Our proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band (full-pay relevant employees)

Who 
 
We  are  reporting  on  full-pay  relevant employees  and  relevant  employees  from  the three  colleges, Rotherham 
College, North Notts College and Dearne Valley College. 
 
Full-pay relevant employee:  A relevant employee who is NOT during the relevant pay period (01 - 31 March 2017) 
being paid at a reduced rate or nil as a result of being on a reduced pay absence such as SMP or SSP 
Relevant employee: A person employed on the snapshot date

Our Gender Pay Gap Data 
 
On the snapshot date our workforce gender demographic consisted of 354 men and 736 women. 
 
The data shows our gender pay gap, based on median hourly salary, is 18.89% lower salary for women across the 
combined colleges. 
 

     

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
Across the four quartiles our workforce is predominantly female. The data shows the breakdown as:

Gender Pay Gap 
 
The gender pay gap is based on full-pay relevant employees and is the difference between the gross hourly earnings 
for all men and the gross hourly earnings for all women. 
 

 

 
Based on a January 2018 published analysis by the Office of National Statistics 
there  is  data  evidence  that  shows  nationally  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  the 
gender pay gap is because fewer women work in the highest-paying occupations 
and in full-time jobs.

In the context of our Colleges our gender pay gap is not caused by unequal pay for women but by the impact, like 
many colleges, of a considerably higher percentage of women employed in the lower quartiles compared to men.  
 
In our lower middle and lower quartiles, due to occupational stereotyping we employ a large number of women 
undertaking the roles of Support Worker, Administration Assistants and Family Support Officers. It is also pertinent 
to highlight that unlike many other organisations we have not outsourced our lower paid support roles such as 
cleaners,  catering  &  learning  support  assistants,  roles  that  are  typically  performed  by  women.  Finally  we  also 
employ a number of apprentices that are, in the main, female. Again this influences the gender pay gap based on 
the median data.

Next Steps 
 
Whilst we recognise the absolute importance of reducing the national gender pay gap, in RNN Group’s case we can 
view part of this figure as a positive reflection of our ability to respond to the demands of our local labour market. 
Like many colleges, we employ considerably more women than men in lower pay occupations, which is a reason 
behind our gender pay gap, which is close to the UK average for the sector. We are committed to creating and 
implementing initiatives which will reduce our gender pay gap.
