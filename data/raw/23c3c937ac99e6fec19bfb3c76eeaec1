Martin Brower UK: Gender Pay Statement and Narrative 

As a business we have a passion for integrity – we strive to do the right thing, all the time and in every 
circumstance  to  enable  us  to  achieve  financial  results,  ensure  a  healthy  future  and  create  a  world 
class organisation.  

As  a  leading  logistics  services  provider,  our  global  business  provides  end-to-end  supply  chain 
management solutions, annually delivering over 520 million cases of food and service products to fast 
food restaurant chains in 19 countries.  

We  care  for  our  people  and  recognise  that  they  are  our  greatest  asset.  We  want  to  ensure  our 
workforce  is  diverse  and  inclusive  by  operating  an  open  and  fair  cultural  environment.  We  aim  to 
attract,  develop  and  retain  the  best  talent  available  whilst  being  committed  to  building  a  company 
which leverages individuals’ unique talents. We aim to provide opportunities to all employees, enabling 
us to deliver a superior service to our customers.  

We recognise the implementation of mandatory gender pay gap reporting is an important step in terms 
of progression and transparency to encourage greater equality of opportunity for women in work.  

Our Gender Pay Gap Report suggests that we have areas where we can do more to support gender 
equality  and,  by  scrutinising the  detail  to  understand  the  reasons  behind  the  high level  numbers,  we 
can develop an action plan which builds on and improves programmes and activities already in place.  

We have a mean gender pay gap of -8.86% favouring females and a median gender pay gap of 2.37% 
favouring males. 

These  figures  compare  very  favourably  to  the  national  figures  reported  by  the  Office  of  National 
Statistics and are evidence of the effort we have already invested in providing access to training and 
development opportunities to encourage and promote female progression into more senior roles. We 
continue to ensure our HR policies encourage and support flexible working within the organisation.  

We have sought to systematically reduce unconscious bias across our organisation, having delivered 
unconscious  bias  training  to  our  UK  and  Ireland  Senior  Leadership  Team,  with  further  rollout  to  our 
supervisors  and managers  to  enable  a more  inclusive culture  and  ensure  we  continue  to  consider  a 
wider and more diverse talent pool. Our HR team actively supports our diversity message across the 
organisation  by  positively  influencing  and  challenging  our  hiring  managers  to  ensure  they  recognise 
how  their  individual  behaviours  and  actions  impact  our  overall  ability  to  create  an  open,  fair  and 
inclusive workplace culture.  

We know that there is still more work to do to encourage more women to join our organisation as we 
strive towards a more gender balanced organisation.

Gender Pay Gap 

Mandatory  Gender  Pay  Gap  Reporting  applies  to  all  private  and  voluntary  sector  employers  in 
England, Wales and Scotland  with at least 250 employees as of the  5th of April  2017 snapshot date.  
Those  organisations  are  required  to  publicly  report  their  gender  pay  gap  metrics  as  follows  on  the 
government-sponsored website, with the aim of eliminating the gender pay gap: 

 

 

As  of  the  5th  April  2017  payroll,  our  mean  gender  pay  gap  stood  at  -8.86%  currently  favouring 
females, with our median gender pay at 2.37%, currently favouring males: 

These  are  both  below  the  national  mean  (17.4%)  and  median  (18.4%)  as  reported  by  the  Office  of 
National Statistics, 2017.  

The  underlying  reason  behind  the  gap  is  predominantly  due  to  the  higher  representation  of  men  in 
more junior roles in our organisation. While we only have a small number of female employees, they 
are  represented  in  higher-paid  roles.  The  Logistics  &  Transportation  industry  is  typically  male-
dominated and this is reflected in our organisation, from Warehouse Operators and Customer Service 
Drivers through to General Managers and Directors. We are confident that all our HR processes and 
practices ensure that our people are not paid differently due to gender.

Our  mean  bonus  gap  currently  stands  at  -61.86%  favouring  females,  with  our  median  bonus  gap 
favouring  females  at  -126.99%.  We  have  a  marginally  higher  proportion  of  female  employees 
receiving a bonus: 

 

The  underlying  reason  for  these  gaps  is  predominantly  due  to  a  much  larger  number  of  males 
receiving lower bonus payments relative to a much smaller female population receiving proportionally 
higher bonus payments. 

Discretionary  performance-related bonuses are awarded  and paid on an annual  basis  via two bonus 
plans,  taking  account  of  individual  performance.  As  an  equal  opportunities  employer,  all  our 
permanent employees (irrespective of their position, age, gender or ethnicity) are eligible for bonus.  

Our gender distribution by quartiles, as defined by the regulations, show us that female employees are 
underrepresented across all four quartiles: 

 

We  are  committed  to  hiring  the  best  talent  for  roles  across  our  organisation,  and  as  part  of  this,  we 
continue  to  actively  create  an  environment  where  everyone  is  motivated  to  develop  and  progress 
through innovative HR policies and practices and an encouraging environment. While we continue to 
make  real  strides  in  this  area,  we  recognise  that  we  need  to  actively  ensure  our  hiring  managers 
reflect our strategic approach to diversity.

Closing remarks 

This  is  our  first  year  reporting  our  gender  pay  gap  and  we know  that  we  need  to further  explore  the 
numbers  and  identify  what  actions  are  required  to  ensure  that  we  make  real  sustained  progress  to 
understand and manage gender pay gap data to reflect a truly gender balanced workforce.  

We  constantly  develop  and  improve  our  HR  policies  and  practices  to  encourage  and  promote  the 
development and progression of all our employees.  

Building  on  our  values,  we  will  continue  to  work  with  all  of  our  employees,  and  regardless  of  age, 
disability,  gender  assignment,  marriage and civil  partnership, sexual  orientation,  gender,  religion  and 
belief,  race,  pregnancy  and  maternity,  provide  them  with  opportunities  to  build  their  confidence  and 
help them in reaching their full potential. 

We confirm that the information contained within this statement is accurate.
