Welcome to  
Michelin UK’s gender 
pay gap report

At Michelin UK we work hard to provide rewarding and 
fulfilling careers for all our employees free from any form of 
discrimination.

“Respect for People” has been one of the Michelin Group’s 
fundamental values for decades and has been a foundation 
stone in our global employee relations strategy. 

We pay and reward people according to the nature of their 
job and their performance, and we endeavour to support 
career progression throughout the business, regardless of 
gender. 

This process of reporting has helped us to look closely 
at gender equality in our business, and whilst we are 
encouraged by the findings, aspects remain which require 
continued effort to improve. 

We will do all we can to close any gaps even further over the 
coming years.

THE PROPORTION OF 

MEN AND WOMEN 

WORKING IN DIFFERENT 

SALARY RANGES

This is an area we have focussed on over the last few 
years, but our gender pay gap analysis shows that we still 
have some work to do.

A significant factor influencing the result was an influx 
of female recruits into the lower salary range during 
2016. Some of these new recruits were still on a “training 
rate” in April 2017. They have now progressed onto the 
established pay scale. 

Difference in  
bonus payouts   
(year ending April 2017)

95.3%

of men received

a bonus

91.8%

of women received 

a bonus

In the majority of cases Michelin UK 
employees are entitled to receive a 
bonus after being with the company 
for a year. The difference in the 
proportion of men and women 
receiving bonuses reflects the high 
proportion of female recruits who 
had been employed for less than 12 
months in April 2017.

Mean bonus 

gender pay gap of 

16%

Median bonus 

gender pay gap of 

28.4%

We have identified several reasons 
why our gender bonus gap is higher 
than our gender pay gap.

For example, the relatively high 
proportion of women in lower 
quartile job categories creates a gap.

In addition, the influx of new female
recruits in 2016 were ineligible for
full bonuses having been employed 
for less than a year at the time of  
the survey. 

Michelin caps annual bonuses at a 
low percentage of salary. This means 
that a relatively small difference in 
bonus payments in absolute terms will 
appear as a relatively large gender 
bonus gap in percentage terms.

The future

Our gender pay gap results are a reflection of the work 
done so far to maintain a balanced working environment. 
Actions such as recruitment drives actively targeting women 
and significant ergonomic changes within factories and 
warehouses to make work physically easier for all our 
employees have helped significantly. But we see this very 
much as work-in-progress, with clear opportunities to 
improve ahead of us. 

Michelin UK is working hard to encourage women to  
consider rewarding careers within engineering, not least 
with our Inspiring Females events at our Stoke-on-Trent  
and Dundee sites.

We continue to be absolutely committed to creating a 
balanced work environment where all employees can fulfil 
their potential. Throughout 2018 and 2019 we will be 
examining how that commitment can lead to more women 
coming into our business at all levels.
