The GPG is defined as the differences in average earnings of men and women regardless of their role or seniority. It does not measure equal pay, which relates to what women and men are paid for the same or similar jobs, or work of equal value.  Companies are required to offer equal pay under the Equality Act 2010. Pure Gym adheres to the Equality act in all respects so men and women with the same level of experience (when experience is relevant) are paid the same at Pure Gym.                    Understanding the GPG  Mean and Median Calculation  We have taken pay data from 625 PureGym employees as of 05 April 2017 to calculate the Median and Mean GPG. Both the Median and Mean calculations are affected by the different numbers of men and women in different roles across the organisation.                Median Calculation  To calculate the Median pay gap, the pay rates of all female employees are arranged from highest to lowest, and similarly for all male employees. The Median GPG is the difference in pay between the female employees in the middle of their range, and the male employee in the middle of their range.      Mean Calculation  The second measure we report is the Mean GPG. This shows the difference in average hourly rate of pay between men and women. To calculate the Mean, we added all female employee's hourly rates together then divide by the number of female employees. Similarly, for male employees.                Bonus Pay Calculations  Median and Mean calculations are carried out when comparing bonus pay over a twelve-month period to 05 April 2017. We also report the proportion of men and women awarded any bonus pay over that period.    Pay Quartiles  Quartiles are calculated by ranking the rates of pay for employees across the business from lowest to highest and dividing in to four equal parts. We then calculate the percentage of men and women in each quartile.                Reporting and analysing PureGym’s GPG  This chart clearly shows our gender pay gap at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017; the difference between the average hourly pay of all women compared to men, regardless of their role or seniority, expressed as a percentage of men’s average pay. The median average pay for all women is 18.1% lower than for all men.  The main reasons for PureGym’s 18% GPG are that in 2017 we had more women than men in our lower paid roles and fewer in our higher paid and most senior roles.  We are already making progress to address the GPG. For example, since autumn 2017 3 out of 7 of the senior leadership team in PureGym have been female – half of the reports to our Chief Executive (who is male).  In addition, benefits – such as maternity and adoption policy – that in particular support females to work at all levels of the business have been significantly enhanced to attract and retain more female colleagues within the business.  Further work is planned in this area for 2018.                        Bonus Pay Gender Gap  86.0% of men at PureGym received a bonus in the 12 months up to 5 April 2017, while 89.2% of women received a bonus payment. This figure for bonus includes bonuses relating to performance, talent introduction and service. The Median average bonus pay for all women is 56.2% lower than for all men.  592 Bonuses were awarded for the period. Our workforce consists of full time, part time and zero-hour employees.                        Gender Balance in Employment at PureGym  The mix of male and female employees at PureGym is weighted toward men. We are working towards improving this balance and attracting more women at all levels of our business. The difference between men and women is fairly consistent across all pay quartiles.                        Declaration  I confirm the information and data reported is accurate as of the snapshot data 5 April 2017.
