At HORIBA MIRA, we pride ourselves on providing vibrant career opportunities for all our staff, at a business that develops some of the world’s most iconic vehicles and pushes the boundaries of automotive technology. We know that what makes our business successful is our people, and we are committed to providing equal opportunities to our staff and developing a rich pool of talent in the automotive industry for years to come.   The automotive industry is acutely aware of the gender pay gap, in part due to a significant proportion of engineers and other STEM graduates being male. Our gender pay gap data illustrates that we do have some work to do to create more opportunities for women to progress in the business, and we discuss below how we are working to close this gap.  We reward our staff based on role size, responsibility level and performance, and we work hard to provide consistency and transparency within our pay decision-making process. We will continue to do so and look for ways that we can encourage more women into the workforce for all roles and levels.   Mean and Median Basic Pay by Gender  As of 5th April 2017, there was a 19% differential between male and female mean basic pay, and a 22% differential in median basic pay. This gap is in part because HORIBA MIRA employs across a broad range of jobs, from admin and sales through to engineering and management roles. In the period reported, the most significant impact on the pay gap was in the market salaries for automotive Technicians. 19% of the HORIBA MIRA workforce is employed within these roles, which have seen an increase due to significant expansion and recruitment in the automotive sector. The market pressure and increased level of attrition within the Technician population led to a need to increase salaries to retain this section of the workforce. As the majority of employees within these roles are male, the salary increase has impacted the pay differential within this part of the workforce, and therefore the overall pay statistics for the company. This change has caused by far the majority of the overall differential.  HORIBA MIRA plans to allocate relevant roles to a subsection of the company grading structure where they can be reviewed more regularly against market rates. The company continues to encourage more women into the workforce for all roles and levels, including Technician vacancies. See our case studies on education engagement and promotion of women in the workplace below.   Bonus  Typically, all employees receive an annual company bonus, reflecting and triggered by the company performance in the previous year.  Unfortunately, the company performance was not sufficient to trigger a bonus in the relevant year and therefore no company-wide bonus was paid. The smaller number of bonuses included in the period measured related mainly to one-off bonuses including joining bonuses and the annual pay review. This split can be seen as 20.7% of men and 13.6% of women receiving a bonus. This difference was largely driven by the greater number of males joining the business during this period. The difference in average bonus between men and women was negligible.  The distribution of male and female employees in the company has been impacted by the industry demographic as mentioned, with female employee numbers in the lower quartiles, (67% in Q1 & Q2 compared to 33% in Q3 & Q4), reflecting the history in this industry sector.  Male employees are more evenly distributed throughout the organisation. In addition to measures already mentioned, significant interaction has been undertaken with the education sector in the region to attract a wide demographic to the industry.  To encourage progression, positive case studies are communicated via various means including company presentations, website, social media and videos, and regular appraisals identify career goals and opportunities for development at HORIBA MIRA. A refocus on talent management encourages staff across the business to apply for a broad range of job and career opportunities. Additionally, the development of the MIRA Technology Institute and the MIRA Academy will support the education and development of staff in all areas, as well as attracting underrepresented groups.  Whilst there is still work to do to close the gender pay gap at HORIBA MIRA, and across the wider automotive industry, we are making strides to ensure men and women have equal opportunities to thrive and be rewarded.    Case Studies   Jo Goold, Talent Management Lead, HORIBA MIRA  I have such a passion for developing people and finding opportunities for them to progress, for those with clear goals and those who need a little more support to clarify what those goals are. My role at HORIBA MIRA has enabled me to do just this, helping to embed talent management into the business and increase development and training opportunities for our staff. Much of my role has been in changing the culture at MIRA to make talent management a priority for managers and make sure we’re utilising all communication streams to promote opportunities for development. We also find that not all Career Progress Development paths are straightforward for everyone and so we work to ensure we are creating bespoke pathways to give staff flexibility in developing their career.  One of the new programmes we’ve launched is a leadership and development programme, rolling out to 24 managers in May this year. With the MIRA Technology Institute opening later this year, I am hoping to offer more programmes and collaborate with the institute to create a better curriculum from apprenticeships through to Masters Degrees.    Lisa Bingley, Operations Manager at MIRA Technology Institute  Engineering is somewhat of a family heritage, and so stepping into a career in engineering was a goal of mine from a very young age. I started my career as an apprentice, eventually joining HORIBA MIRA on the graduate scheme and specialising in safety integration engineering, working my way up to Programme Manager. Through my project management experience, managing lots of varied groups of people, and with my background delivering education and STEM programmes in local schools, my current role as Operations Manager for MIRA Technology Institute was a natural progression.  My one piece of advice would be that a basic engineering degree can get you anywhere. Engineering covers multiple disciplines, each as different as the next, and the diversity of roles at HORIBA MIRA, from technicians through to project managers highlights the varied career you can have in engineering. We’re hoping the MIRA Technology Institute will help raise awareness for this, developing talent at all levels, from apprentices right through to qualified engineers.     Lucy Booth, Customer Services Function Leader, HORIBA MIRA  I joined HORIBA MIRA after having two children and taking a career break as a manager in the hospitality and events sector. My preference was to find a company near home, so I could easily balance work and family life, and HORIBA MIRA being an international business only six miles away from home, was a perfect option.  I started at HORIBA MIRA in a part-time contracted project admin role, which luckily lead me into further permanent roles within marketing and finally progressed seven years on to a full-time Customer Service Manager role. I am happy to announce that I have set up a brand new department focusing on Customer Service and lead a fantastic team looking after everything customer-centric at MIRA, from onsite event and tour organising through to sales desk/guest services and customer feedback. I think the key reasons I’ve managed to work up to this role is working hard to show my dedication in maintaining an excellent level of service at work, alongside my busy family life – and being honest with my managers about my career aspirations. To get here, I’ve had to strike a balance between putting in the hours and making the time for my job, as well as MIRA supporting me with flexible working. Throughout my time here, I have always had managers that have understood the challenges in raising children and having a fulfilling career. This has helped so much as I have felt supported to enable me to do a really good job and give as much as I can in the workplace, as well as having a balanced family life.     Paula French, IT Function Leader, HORIBA MIRA  I started with HORIBA MIRA as an IT support supervisor in May 2008. Moving back to the East Midlands, I was looking for a company with the right atmosphere to start the next stage of my career. I had heard some really interesting things about MIRA and when I came in for interview I knew it was the right fit - a tightknit organisation where I felt like I could make an impact. IT is very diverse, complex and demanding, the ever-changing nature of the job means that there is never a dull moment and working in IT for an engineering firm like MIRA presents its own technical challenges, which is exactly what keeps me coming back.  In 2011 I left for maternity leave and then returned in a part-time capacity, working in a job share. Two years down the line the opportunity arose to apply for the IT Manager role and I was successful. Working on reduced hours, I am able to run my own department at HORIBA MIRA as well as spend time with my family. There was a willingness on both sides to make this successful, with both parties being flexible to the needs of the other. When I need to work different hours, the company makes it possible. By the same token, when I need to take work home, I’m happy to do so. It is this compromise on both sides that is the secret to making this work.     Shani Roberts, MIRA Academy co-ordinator  I started my career with HORIBA MIRA in 2004, working as a Calibration Administrator - a role I stayed in until 2008, when I was out of the business for nine months on maternity leave.  After my maternity, I returned to MIRA on a part time basis, working three days a week and gradually increasing my hours over time. In 2014 the MIRA Academy Co-ordinator role became available and I have been in the position ever since.  A key part of my role is to work with local school and colleges to be a STEM ambassador, engaging with students and promoting STEM subjects and careers to burgeoning young talent. Alongside my team of around 20 ambassadors, we reach out to students at various levels in diverse ways. Our activities in the community range from career events and assembly talks, to working with graduates and apprentices to develop interview skills. Cultivating real world skills is vital to the MIRA Academy and we currently have 12 apprentices on site. Understanding that promoting STEM starts at the top down, we are currently arranging events aimed at teachers, giving them a true understanding of what a life in engineering entails.
