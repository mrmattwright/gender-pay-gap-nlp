Hide this message                 ODEON UK GENDER PAY GAP  ODEON UK's gender pay gap is lower than the national average thanks to the work we’ve been doing in recent years. It’s also clear that we have more work to do in the future to create a truly equal result. This work is underway, and we are already achieving positive results.
