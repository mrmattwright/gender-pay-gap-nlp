Norfolk Community Health and Care seeks to improve the quality of people’s lives, in their homes and community by providing the best in integrated health and social care. We want to do that by offering care that is compassionate and personal to individuals. This means recognising and responding to their different needs and circumstances to provide care consistently to everyone. We will work together with the public and our patients to overcome barriers to delivering good care. As an employer we will give equal opportunities to our staff and value the diversity of our workforce. As an NHS Trust we also have legal duties with which we must comply.  These relate to individuals who receive care from us or work for us. Very simply this means that people cannot be treated less favourably because of, for example, their race, age, gender, disability, religion or sexual orientation. We will use a process used across the NHS called the Equality Delivery System 2 to help us fulfil our duties.  The work will be led by our Equality and Diversity steering group and overseen by the Board of Directors who lead the Trust. We encourage everyone to support our commitment to equality and diversity and work with us to implement the Equality Delivery System 2.  If you would like more information, click here .  Advocacy is important to NCH&C and we have appointed and trained a number of advocates and champions to help guide and support patients, members of the public and our staff.

An Equality and Diversity Committee meets every two months to oversee service delivery, workforce data and to steer the organisation to address any emerging issues. This committee began as a steering group aiming to develop the single equality scheme in response to the Equality Act 2010. It is chaired by the Director of Strategy and Transformation and membership includes a Non Executive Director, PALS, Health Watch, expert service users as well as interested staff. Work over the next year will be overseeing all the E&D activities, making sure they are embedded into our daily business by influencing the thinking and behaviour of the organisation and its members and the development of the Equality Delivery System 2 (EDS). The Board approved action plan can be found here . The committee will be responsible for demonstrating compliance with statutory duties, monitoring and celebrating change. If you would like to be involved, please contact alex.watson@nchc.nhs.uk or paul.cracknell@nchc.nhs.uk for an informal chat.
