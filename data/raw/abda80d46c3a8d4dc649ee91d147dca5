Equality Data 2017/18    Equality Objectives  The Trust's Strategic Equality & Diversity Objectives for
2016 - 2019 were developed by the Trust's Equality & Diversity
Group, informed by key priorities from a range of sources including
the Workforce Race Equality Standard, the National Staff Survey
results and the EDS2 self-assessment, and supported by the Equality
& Diversity Action Plan.  Our overall objectives are:  To improve access to services for our
local communities  This includes specific commitments to fully implement the
Accessible Information Standard, and to increase the breadth of
information we have about our patients to better able the Trust to
provide services aligned to the needs of our local communities.  To improve the opportunities for members
of our diverse communities to gain employment with and progress
within the Trust.  In particular to increase recruitment activities to engage with
local talent, encouraging people from all backgrounds to view the
Trust as an employer of choice, and to make use of the Teaching and
Learning Framework to facilitate and encourage the progress of
staff from Black & Minority Ethnic Backgrounds.  To work towards a more inclusive and
supportive working environment for all of our staff.  With an emphasis on providing an environment free from
harassment, bullying or abuse from colleagues or service users.  Progress against all of the objectives is supported and
monitored by the Trust's Equality & Diversity Group. 
Progress during 2016/17 has been reported to the Trust's Workforce
and Organisational Development Group and the Trust Board as part of
