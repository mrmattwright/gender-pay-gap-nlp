Gender pay gap

Leicestershire County Council
All organisations with over 250 staff are required to publish 
figures to show how big the pay gap is between male and female 
employees. This is part of our Public Sector Equality Duty, which we 
must comply with by law. The figures used are from March 2017.

mean gap

Our current (mean) pay gap stands 
at 18%, in other words, female 
employees mean hourly rate is 18% 
lower than male employees. This is in 
line with the national average of 18.1%.

Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings)

Our current (median) pay gap stands 
at 20%, in other words, female 
employees median hourly rate is 20% 
lower than male employees. This is 
better than the national average of 23%.

The mean can be defined as 
the average of a set of numbers. 
This is achieved by adding up 
the values and then dividing by 
the number of values.

The median can be defined as 
the middle number in a ranked 
list of numbers. The median 
can be used to determine an 
approximate average.

While we are in line with other large organisations (and slightly better if you look at the 
median), we recognise that our predominantly female workforce isn’t represented at all 
levels and we need to attract more women into senior job roles.

We have a number of programmes in place with this aim in mind, such as the Springboard 
management training programme, and we actively celebrate our female managers as role 
models, including our annual International Women’s Day event for staff.

Our workforce (around 6,000) is nearly ¾ female (74% female and 26% male).

There are a large number job roles at our lower grades (such as school food support, for 
example, where there are around 750 posts) where we still see a huge trend in females 
applying for what in the past were traditionally seen as female jobs.

We need to continue to help break these gender stereotypes, and attract more women into 
senior roles. Since these figures were produced our senior management percentages have 
improved, for example by recruiting a female director of Environment & Transport. You can 
see some of the detail in the ‘gender split’ infographic below.

* Official government guidance states that Gender Pay Gap reporting requires other monetary payments such as 
allowances, shift premium pay etc to be taken into account when calculating hourly pay. This is in addition to basic 
pay. Due to this reason there are a small number of anomalies whereby some employees in lower grades are currently 
accounted for in higher quartiles.

In addition to the council now having to produce the Gender Pay Gap information it is 
important to note that we also conduct an Equal Pay Audit every three years. This analyses 
whether there are discrepancies in pay for employees undertaking similar roles. From 
previous audits it can be reported that no gender pay issues have been identified. There is 
also the adoption of a HAY Job Evaluation Scheme that also ensures through its application 
that no gender pay issues should occur.

Leicestershire County Council have a 0% mean and median bonus gender pay gap (as we 
do not operate any performance related pay / bonus scheme).
