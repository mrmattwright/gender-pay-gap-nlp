Assessing SSE’s UK gender pay gap

In 2016 SSE became one of the first FTSE100 companies to publish its gender pay gap, using the 
draft regulations available at the time.  That exercise was both interesting and instructive.  This year, 
while the methodology has changed, SSE now has two years of data to understand and act upon.

Following draft requirements, the UK Government has 
confirmed its regulations for Gender Pay Gap Reporting (GPGR) 
for UK companies. It requires UK businesses with more than 
250 employees to publish their GPGR statistics as at 5 April 
2017 within one year of this date, and then on an annual basis. 
The method for calculating this information has been outlined 
in detail by the UK Government1 and the results from every 
organisation will be published on a UK Government website2.

The gender pay gap is not about equal pay for men and women 
doing the same job. SSE has a robust process to ensure pay 
levels are reviewed using a fair and consistent process. 

An annual review of the performance ratings by gender is also 
carried out to make sure there are no anomalies between male 
and female employee performance ratings.

When calculating the difference in average earnings, the 
gender pay gap takes into account all jobs, at all levels and 
all salaries within an organisation. This means the gender pay 
gap paints a picture of the level of roles that women carry out 
in an organisation. The roles that women fill can result from 
many different factors, such as historic trends of one gender 
dominating certain industries and type of jobs. 

Reporting SSE’s gender pay gap

The UK Government GPGR regulations have four key requirements:

(1)  Reporting the differences in mean and median pay between men and women 

(3)

calculated on the basis of equivalent hourly pay rates;

(2)  Reporting the distribution of men and women between pay band quartiles, 

calculated using the range of hourly pay rates;

(3)  Reporting the differences in mean and median bonus pay between men and 

Mean difference between 
male and female bonus 
payments

2016/17

32.5%

women; and

(4)  Reporting the proportion of men and women receiving bonus pay in a year. 

All organisations with 250 or more employees are required to publish these 
statistics. Due to the structure of SSE, this means SSE must publish data  for ten 
separate business entities, as well as the overall figures for SSE Plc. The results 
detailed here are the overall results for SSE Plc, with the full breakdown for 
each applicable business entity published on the following page. SSE employed 
the services of Pinsent Masons law firm to review SSE’s interpretation of the 
Government regulations and the applied methodology.

Analysing SSE’s gender pay gap
SSE’s median gender pay gap of 19.3% in 2016/17 is slightly 
higher than its gap in 2015/16 of 18.7%3. This widening of the 
gap is not unexpected and is a consequence of SSE’s strategy to 
become more inclusive and diverse – and close the gap in the 
long-run. Further details of this are described below.  

Genuine transformation for SSE, and across the UK’s labour 
market, will require meaningful societal changes as well as 
improvements at organisational-level. SSE is committed to 
being a leader for driving change in both of these areas.

Understanding the societal  
and organisational challenges
SSE operates within the energy industry; a sector that relies on 
the expertise and experience of highly-skilled workers from 
STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) related 

fields. Just 21% of the Core STEM workforce in the UK are 
women4, and the UK has the lowest percentage of female 
engineering professionals in Europe –under 10%5 compared to 
an average of around 20%. 

While SSE’s overall proportion of female employees is around 
30%, just 3% of the top 10 operational roles in the company6 are 
filled by women. Within SSE’s different business areas, those with 
an operational focus have a significantly higher gender pay gap 
than the pay gap for the overall company. For example, within 
SSE Generation Ltd the median gender pay gap is 27% and 
within Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission Plc it’s 36.1%. The full 
breakdown of these results can be found on the following page.

Last year SSE reported its gender diversity strategy which 
focused on three elements: encouraging women in, supporting 
women to stay on, and helping women to progress up. 

Taking action on SSE’s gender pay gap

Taking action: encouraging  
women IN to the company
With such low numbers of women in 
operational roles, SSE has placed inclusivity 
firmly at the heart of its recruitment this 
year with inclusive recruitment training 
for all hiring managers and a focus on 
diversity within its Graduate and Apprentice 
recruitment drives. Examples of female 
employees who have found success at SSE 
have been used within adverts, case studies, 
videos, leaflets and at careers events across 
the UK, while social media has been used 
more creatively, for example, through a live 
‘Women in STEM’ Twitter Q&A.

There has been notable growth in the 
number of female graduates attracted this 
year, from 17% last year to 40%. Across all 
of SSE’s directorates, 39% of hires made 
in 2016/17 were female – an increase 
of almost 20% from 2013/14. This rise 
in women attracted into the company, 
particularly at entry-level positions, can 
partly explain the increase in SSE’s gender 
pay gap over the last year. 

Taking action: supporting  
women to stay ON
Creating jobs and a working environment 
where women want to stay on is just as 
important. In 2016/17 SSE focused on two 
key areas to encourage a more inclusive 
workplace for everyone: the introduction 
of sector-leading parental benefits (see 
case study on page 28) and new initiatives 
to encourage flexible working.  

A new office centre in Reading has 
been used as an opportunity to pilot 
flexible working at scale.  Around 1,500 
employees were relocated to these new 
premises and given the opportunity to 
“work differently”, with compressed hours, 
occasional home working, and different 
start and finish times to allow for better 
work life balance. Skype for Business is 
also being rolled out for all employees 
and a Technology Loan Scheme was 
introduced to help employees with the 
purchase of computers, laptops, tablets 
and printers.

Furthermore, SSE has created 
‘Encouraging Difference Steering Groups’ 
for each directorate, sponsored by 
Managing Directors. These groups help 
promote operational-level support for 
greater inclusion across the business; 
empowering employees to drive relevant 
change locally. 

Taking action: helping  
women progress UP
It is SSE’s responsibility to create an 
environment where all employees reach 
their full potential.  In early 2016, SSE 
created a Senior Women’s Development 
Network (SWDN) which focuses on 
increasing the connectedness of women 
across the business and supports them to 
develop their leadership capability. SSE’s 
commitment to encouraging self-led 
development is further enabled by the 
‘everywoman’ learning and development 
platform which is available to SSE’s whole 

workforce, with around 400 learning 
hours used by employees per month on 
average.  

SSE has a target of increasing the number 
of women earning over £40,000 a year 
to at least 25% by 2025. In 2016/17, the 
number of female employees earning 
over this level increased to 12.8% from 
11.9% in 2015/16.

Taking action: influencing 
 wider society
Lastly, to help target the root problem 
around gender norms, in 2016/17 SSE 
continued its £100,000 partnership 
with educational charity Teach First. 
The partnership has been designed 
specifically to encourage more young 
girls at secondary school level into STEM 
subjects; aiming to increase the well-
being, resilience and core skills of female 
pupils from low-income communities. 
On top of this, SSE has partnered with a 
number of major organisations in the UK 
that share its goal of encouraging greater 
female participation in STEM.

SSE has invested in key sponsorships of 
women in sport events to help break 
down perceived barriers. The seven-
figure title sponsorship deal for the SSE 
Women’s FA Cup is the flagship of these 
activities but other sponsorships include 
the Women’s Scottish Cup, a Women’s 
Golf Invitational and ‘next generation’ 
Sports Aid athletes.
