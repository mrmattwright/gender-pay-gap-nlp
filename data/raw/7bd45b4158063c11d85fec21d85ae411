At Roman we are committed to treating our people equally no matter what their background, race, ethnicity or gender. 
We are confident that our gender pay gap is not caused by men and women being paid differently to do the same job 
but is driven instead by the structure of our workforce. 
 
93% of our workforce is female, as the majority of our roles are store based which attract female applicants. At the 
snapshot date we employed 687 female employees and 51 male employees.  We have compared the average pay of all 
the women with the average pay for all the men from this sample (for both mean and median calculations).

Our findings show female employees are paid 32% less than the men as a mean average and 10.6% less than men as a 
medium average. The National average mean is 18%. 
 
Roman is UK national a ladies fashion retailer and there is a high ratio of female workers in the stores environment. 
However in the head office, where salaries are higher, there is a higher ratio of men to women. This imbalance causes a 
disparity in the results.

The Way Forward 

 

We are confident that that men and women working for us are being paid equally for doing equivalent jobs.  We will 
continue to focus on women having the same opportunities as men for all roles at Roman. 
 
We confirm that the data is true and accurate.
