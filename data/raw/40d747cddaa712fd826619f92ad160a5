It is our aim to encourage and support all students and staff to reach their full potential, and to create a positive and inclusive learning environment. All students and staff have a duty to support and promote equality of opportunity.  The Equality Act 2010 has introduced a public sector equality duty which requires the College to have due regard for the need to: Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act 2010; Advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it; and Foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it. Read our Equality and Diversity Policy here (PDF). In line with requirements under the Equality Act 2010, the College has published an Annual Summary of Equality Information (PDF) relating to our staff and student population. We have recently begun to collect and collate information on the newer protected characteristics of religion and belief and sexual orientation, taking account of good practice guidance regarding sensitive information.  As part of our public sector equality duty, we have published the latest version of the College’s Equality Objectives for 2012–16 (PDF) . We realise that promoting equality and diversity is an ongoing process, and we are always seeking to consult with and involve different sectors of the community. If you have any comments about your experiences as an applicant or visitor to the College that relate to equality and diversity please contact student-support@rca.ac.uk . Visit RCA Stories to find out about some of the different people who have studied at the College. Gender Pay Gap Report The UK Government requires employers with 250 or more relevant employees to publish gender pay gap information by April 2018, based on data from 31 March 2017 (public sector). Download our Gender Pay Gap Report (PDF) here.
