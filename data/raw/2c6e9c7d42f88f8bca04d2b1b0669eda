Modern Slavery Act Statement  Slavery and Human Trafficking Transparency Statement for the Financial Year 2016.  This Statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 ('Act') and sets out the steps that Forest Garden Group Limited and its subsidiary companies has taken during the previous financial year to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking from operating within either its own business or its supply chains. We recognise that modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights.  Company Overview  Forest Garden is the UK's largest manufacturer and supplier of timber garden buildings and fencing to the retail market. We sell our products through large retail outlets such as B&Q; and Homebase, and increasingly via our E-Commerce online business.. We operate from five locations in the UK at Hartlebury, Worcester, Clows Top, Sennybridge and Lockerbie. Forest has this year introduced a comprehensive system of checks aimed at verifying the status of all our employees. Every person on our payroll has documentation on their file verifying their name, address, nationality and financial details, which have been checked to confirm their authenticity.  Modern Slavery in the Supply Chain  We want our customers to be confident that we treat our employees fairly, with respect for human rights, and are not exposed to unsafe working conditions or in any way forced to work under slavery. We believe that when ethical standards are in place, this can improve worker well-being, productivity and quality. We do this through a series of measures and policies covering Whistleblowing, Anti-Bribery and Corruption, ensuring all employees have employment contracts, and we also monitor employee remuneration and benefits to ensure these meet national legislative requirements.  We also want our customers to be confident that our business partners and in particular our suppliers treat their employees as fairly as we treat our own employees. Imported products sourced from outside the UK or EEC are potentially more at risk of slavery or human trafficking issues, and we focus our efforts accordingly. Where possible we have built long standing relationships with our suppliers and we make very clear our expectations of business behaviour, engaging only those suppliers that uphold the same principles as ourselves. In the event that suppliers fail to take steps to cease or prevent adverse human rights impacts, Forest will terminate its business relationships with those suppliers.  We are an associate member of the 'Association of Labour Providers', an organisation dedicated to the prevention of human trafficking. Timber products are sourced responsibly through accreditation schemes such as FSC/PEFC which require adherence to international labour laws and declaration. Senior managers are involved in spot-check visits to suppliers, both within and outside the EU.  We recognise that all our employees have a responsibility to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. We have developed an open management style and culture which encourages the reporting of concerns to senior management as soon as they are raised, and management are expected to act upon them immediately.  This Statement has been approved by the Board of Directors.
