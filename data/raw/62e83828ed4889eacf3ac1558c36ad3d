A breadth of talent, opinion, judgement and experience within any organisation enables it to be more creative and to challenge existing thinking, delivering more innovatively and gaining competitive advantage.  Training and awareness is embedded formally in our Diversity Handbook. This document codifies our commitment to diversity, forms part of the induction programme each new employee receives and outlines the different types of equality legislation in the UK and how they affect recruitment.  Refresher courses are provided for employees that are promoted into new positions, and additional training is provided to Odgers Berndtson researchers on how to build diversity into candidate identification.  Our responsibility to our clients is to support them to make diversity a reality in their organisations. We are committed to ensuring that we provide our clients with choice and are continuing to find ways to improve the creativity with which we tackle assignments. We actively create networks with organisations that assist us in sourcing more diverse candidates.  More broadly, our commitment to diversity is at every level of our own organisation. We value diversity in ethnicity, disability, gender, language, age, sexual orientation, religion, socio-economic status, political persuasion, experience and education. We aim to ensure that employees are treated fairly, evaluated objectively and enabled to succeed.  A successful organisation depends upon the insight of its people. The exceptional growth of our business to date is a reflection of the quality and skill of our people. We are committed to seeking out and retaining the finest talent for our clients and for ourselves.  We support the legislation to increase gender pay gap transparency. See our Gender Pay Gap report 2018.    Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement  Odgers Berndtson fully supports the Modern Slavery Act 2015. That said as an executive search consultancy with few external suppliers we do not have significant interaction that can impact external firm’s policies. As a business we are proud to pay a national living wage to all our directly employed staff and we direct our suppliers who provide catering, cleaning and other related services to us to do likewise. We carry out thorough due diligence on these suppliers and will for any new major contractor or supplier in the future.
