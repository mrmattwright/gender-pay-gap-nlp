Details     The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) has prepared this report as part of the new legal requirement for public authorities to publish their gender pay gap every year.  DCMS is committed to minimising the gender pay gap, and our approach to pay seeks to reward all staff fairly, regardless of gender.  The DCMS Diversity and Inclusion Plan, which was launched in 2016, strives for the department to identify all talent and to help them to succeed, regardless of gender or any protected characteristic, by removing barriers to ensure that diverse or underrepresented groups have equal opportunities to succeed.
