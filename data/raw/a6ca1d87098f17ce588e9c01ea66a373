Pay Gap   Mean Gender Pay Gap: 20.8%   Median Gender Pay Gap: 2.5%   •	We note that the median gender pay gap for Wadworth is below the national average of 9.1% (2017).  •	We recognise that our mean gender pay gap is slightly higher than the 2017 national average of 18% which, to a certain extent, can be explained by the lack of female representation at the most senior level in our organisation rather than pay inequality in the same or similar roles.  •	We have conducted a detailed pay audit to better understand where our challenges lie; the Executive Team has committed to taking appropriate action on an ongoing basis.  •	We will also continue to explore strategies to encourage female progression / applicants to senior roles.    Bonus Pay Gap   Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap: 54.5%   Median Bonus Gender Pay Gap: 85%   Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a bonus payment:   Male: 32.5%  Female: 23.8%   •	At our Brewery & Support Centre we operate a Profit Bonus Scheme that all employees benefit from after 3 months of service; this is harmonised across all roles and grades.  Structured bonus schemes are also in place for key roles within our retail and sales teams.  •	In our Managed House estate structured bonus payments are made to the managers who run our retail sites as well as to other key roles (e.g. head chefs).  •	In general, there are more males than females within the groups of employees that receive bonus payments.    Quartile Distribution     Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest to highest pay:                  Male  Female    Upper Quartile  66.8%  33.2%    Upper Middle Quartile  52.5%  47.5%    Lower Middle Quartile  25.9%  74.1%    Lower Quartile  47.1%  52.9%       •	In recent years we have appointed a number of female candidates into senior roles in our business.  For the period covered by this report there are 2 females on the senior executive team and more recently we have appointed a female non-executive director.  •	We are building our succession planning and career development processes to ensure potential is identified and developed at all levels and across all business areas regardless of gender.  •	We will continue to explore longer-term plans to improve female representation at the senior level.
