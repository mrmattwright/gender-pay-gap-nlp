The above figures illustrate the gender distribution at Bellrock 
across four equally sized quartiles, each containing just under  
112 employees.

Our records indicate that all staff are paid the same rate for  
equivalent roles and that our pay gap is driven by the proportion  
of women in senior positions. 

Our aim is to attract and recruit more female employees into our 
upper quartile, which we are confident will narrow the overall  
gender pay gap.

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
