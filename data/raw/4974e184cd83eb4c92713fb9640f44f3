Home   Gender Pay Gap 2017 Gender Pay Gap 2017 We proudly employ a workforce that reflects a diverse community as we value individuality irrespective of gender or any other protected characteristic. Our recruitment process selects candidates based on their skill set and their potential contribution to our business. Employees are paid fairly and in line with the responsibilities attached to their roles. We promote a working environment free from unlawful discrimination and encourage a culture of respect, dignity and integrity. Our Commitment We are fully committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all of our business dealings. We continue to employ the ideal candidate for each role based on skills alone, regardless of gender or any other protected characteristic. We will ensure a fair pay grading system is consistently applied and are fully committed to working towards eliminating our Gender Pay Gap. This will be achieved by continuing to review our current pay structure and enhancing our Flexible Working Policy, along with the continuous monitoring of our GPG until we reach 0%. Snapshot Date 5 April 2017 Company Total - Stores and Head Office Mean Gender Pay Gap Hourly Pay 15.8% Median Gender Pay Gap Hourly Pay 0.0% Gender Bonus Gap Mean and Median No Bonus  Quartiles Male Female Lower Quartile 55.6% 44.4% Lower Middle Quartile 57.0% 43.0% Upper Middle Quartile 55.2% 44.8% Upper Quartile 61.0% 39.0%  Stores Mean Gender Pay Gap Hourly Pay 4.9% Median Gender Pay Gap Hourly Pay 0.0% Gender Bonus Gap Mean and Median No Bonus  Quartiles Male Female Lower Quartile 55.3% 44.7% Lower Middle Quartile 58.9% 41.1% Upper Middle Quartile 50.3% 49.7% Upper Quartile 64.9% 35.1%  Head Office Mean Gender Pay Gap Hourly Pay 42.7% Median Gender Pay Gap Hourly Pay 40.0% Gender Bonus Gap Mean and Median No Bonus  Quartiles Male Female Lower Quartile 38.1% 61.9% Lower Middle Quartile 52.4% 47.6% Upper Middle Quartile 57.1% 42.9% Upper Quartile 76.2% 23.8% Findings We are confident employees are paid equally for equivalent roles and this is supported by further research. Our Gender Pay Gap which is currently 2.3% lower than the national average, suggests men are paid more than females however this is misleading and does not truly reflect our organisation or the equality present within our business. Head Office pay rates are typically higher, creating a disparity across our results where this imbalance is not taken into consideration. Our Directors are male (demonstrated in upper quartile) as fewer females apply for these roles when available. This is something the business will also focus on with regards to candidate attraction, looking at factors encouraging females to apply for senior roles along with a review of developing talent within. Interestingly by removing Directors from our results, and reporting on all employees (not solely full pay relevant), we are able to analyse our full workforce (less Directors) which demonstrates a 3.8% Mean result and - 2.1% Median. These results highlight a significantly lower Gender Pay Gap, 14.3% lower than the national average and a higher average female hourly rate, which is a far more accurate representation of our business on the 5 April 2017 snapshot date. Gender Balance Regardless of being a predominantly Menswear Retailer, we proudly attract both male and female candidates. On the 5 April 2017 snapshot date, we had a good balance of employees 57% male and 43% female compared to other Menswear Retailers. Analysing our GPG has been an extremely valuable exercise enabling us to better measure and monitor gaps to aid improvement. It will support our commitment in eliminating our Gender Pay Gap and we look forward to publishing our updated results for April 2018.
