Gender Pay Gap 
Report 

March 2018 

Background 

• Gender pay gap legislation came into force in October 2016 as part of the Equality Act 2010 

(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2016 

• This requires all Employers in England, Wales and Scotland, with at least 250 employees, to 

publish gender pay information 

• This was made mandatory on 31 March 2017 for public sector organisations to report 

annually on their gender pay gap and the first report deadline is the 31 March 2018 

• The following report includes each of the statutory requirements of the legislation detailed 

below: 

 Average gender pay gap as a mean average 

 Average gender pay gap as a median average 

 Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average 

 Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average 

 Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving  a 

bonus payment 

 Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest 

to highest pay 

Background 

• The information must be published on both the Trusts website and on a designated 

government website at www.gov.uk/genderpaygap 

• Reports were extracted from the Electronic Staff Record Business Intelligence reporting tool 

(ESRBI) as at the reporting date of 31 March 2017 

• The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and 

women in an organisation 

• Gender pay gap reporting is not a report on equal pay 

• Equal Pay is the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, 

similar jobs or work of equal value 

• It is possible to have equality of pay but still have a gender pay gap.  

• The NHS uses Agenda For Change to ensure equal pay for those staff carrying out the same 

job, on the same band with progression due to length in post and not gender 

• This information will be updated annually on the ‘snapshot’ date each year.

•

•

The Trust have over 5% more than the national average of women in NHS organisations  

The national split of the working population across England is 47% women and 53% men 

South Tees has a higher proportion of Professionally Registered Nurses (+3.66%) than the national average which 

contributes to our larger female workforce 

• Women have traditionally been attracted to the roles in healthcare, primarily Nursing & Midwifery and support roles 

such as Health Care Assistant/Therapy Assistant due to the flexibility and family friendly policies offered by the NHS 

•

For our Trust this also applies to Allied Health Professional roles such as Physiotherapy, Radiography and Speech 

and Language Therapy

•

•

•

The Medical & Dental Workforce is made up primarily of Doctors and Consultants and currently there is a significant 

male population in this workforce group – Nationally Medical & Dental staff are split 45% women and 55% male – we 

are therefore not in line with the national average 

There is a definitive shift within Medical & Dental in South Tees as those staff under 40 are 54.97% male and 45.03% 

female  and those under 30 53.99% female and 46.01% male. This will potentially have an impact in narrowing the 

gender pay gap in the future.  

Nationally Nursing & Midwifery tend to attract less males into the profession, resulting in a predominantly female 

workforce (national data – 89.90% are female and 10.10% are male). This also impacts AHP and Nursing Support 

roles meaning South Tees have a much greater level of women in Bands 5 - 7 roles.

•

Senior Roles (Band 8 and above) see a higher percentage of male staff than all other Bands  

In Bands 2 – 7 there is a higher % of Female staff against our Trust average of 82.11% 

Band 1 appears to be an exception (under average) due to over 50% being roles in the Estates & Ancillary workforce 

group which the Trust predominantly receives male candidates for e.g. Porters, Domestic Assistants.

Mean is the average value 

of a set of data 

•

•

•

The variance of £5.09 between male and female staff which indicates that overall men earn 28.27% more than women 

across all staff employed by the Trust 

The gap is attributable to the fact that the majority of the higher earners are Doctors and Consultants and of these 67.92% 

are male  

If we exclude our Medical & Dental Workforce then the mean gap drops to £0.41 or 3.23% 

• Women are well represented in the Top 20 earners (calculated on hourly rate)with 9 of them being women  

•

As of the 1 April 2017 (which this report is taken from) South Tees were operating with a leadership team inlcuding: 

•

•

6 out of 12 females on the Board (i.e. Chief Executive Officer, Nursing Director, Finance Director, HR Director, 

Quality Director and Director of Professions) 

8 out of 11 females in other Senior Leadership Team roles.

Median is the middle value of a 

set of data. The data is sorted 

in order from the lowest to the 

highest and the median is the 

middle value. 

•

This gives a variance of £2.55 between male and female staff which is a gap of 18.46% 

• When looking at the variance consideration should be given to the variety of roles within the organisation

The lower quartile represents the lowest 

paid quarter of staff in the Trust and the 

upper quartile represents the highest paid 

quarter of staff in the Trust. The hourly pay 

of each person is sorted and divided into 4 

groups (as above). 

•

•

There is a higher proportion of female staff in the lower quartile; included in this quartile are admin & clerical and 

estates & ancillary staff groups that have a higher proportion of female staff which is reflected in the calculation. 

The upper quartile has a higher proportion of female staff. The variance in this quartile is mainly due to significantly 

different gender splits in medical staffing and managerial roles in the trust, this is countered by a greater proportion of 

female staff in the scientific and nursing staff groups.

•

•

•

Variance of £4259.34 between male and female staff which means that overall men earn 31.10% more than women in 

terms of bonus payments 

The Consultant workforce consists of 73.84% men and 26.16% women - nationally data show Consultants in the NHS 

are split 65% male and 35% female – South Tees varies by 8% to the national average 

A higher % of male Consultants receive a CEA - of 186 total Consultants 155 are male and 31 are female - which 

equates to 16.67% of female Consultants receiving an award (it should be noted the Consultants have to apply to 

receive an award and not all apply)

• As with the median hourly rate of pay, this is based on the mid-point of all staff receiving bonus pay. 

• Bonus pay applies to just over 5.14% of all staff employed 

• The median value for Bonus Payments indicates a smaller gap when compared with the mean data  

• The pay gap reduces to 22.50% or £2013.89. Bonus payments ranged from £1,123 to £58,839 for men and £2,088 to

Bonus Pay primarily consists of Clinical Excellence Awards which are only awarded to Consultants. Therefore a small 

percentage of the staff in the Trust are eligible for a ‘bonus payment’. 

0.45% of the Trust’s female staff received bonus pay which is 31 staff all of whom are consultants. 

10.31% of the Trust’s male staff received bonus pay which is 155 staff all of whom are consultants. 

Of eligible consultant staff 27.43% of females received bonus pay when compared with 48.59% of male consultants.

Once Medical staff are excluded the gap drops to £0.41 and 3.23% 

The highest gaps are seen both in Band 1 and Band 9 staff. Within Band 9 there are a small group of 12 staff and 

within Band 1 this includes 26 apprentices who receive less than the bottom of a Band 1 of which 22 are women.

•

•

Of the 7 staff groups (when excluding medical and dental professionals) women earn more in 2 areas, Allied Health 

Professionals and Nursing and Midwifery (which are two of the biggest staff groups).  

The largest gap can be seen with Admin & Clerical which is reflective of the higher number of males in senior roles. 

• Within Admin & Clerical 25.99% of men are in a post that is Band 7 and above, in comparison to 7.64% of women  

•

Similarly with Estates and Ancillary although there is a larger proportion of males within this staff group - 16.11% of all 

males are in a post that is Band 5 and above, in comparison to 1.42% of women

The report has shown a difference in pay between male and female staff overall. It is important to remember that 

gender pay gap reporting is different to equal pay as it shows the difference in the average pay between all men and 

all women in the workforce – not those with comparable roles.  

The gender pay gap is attributable to a number of factors but is primarily impacted by the high number of male staff in 

the Medical & Dental workforce group. 

The Medical & Dental Workforce is on average the highest paid workforce group e.g. 84 of the top 100 hourly earners 

are within Medical & Dental 

If we exclude the Medical & Dental Workforce then the mean gap drops to £0.41 or 3.23% 

The gender pay gap is likely to reduce in the future given the larger number of female staff in the Medical & Dental 

workforce in the younger age brackets e.g. those under 30 are 53.99% female and 46.01% male
