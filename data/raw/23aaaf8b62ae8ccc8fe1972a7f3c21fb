From the end of March all public sector organisations with more than 250 employees must publish their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. The gap can exist for a number of reasons and does not mean that men and women are being paid unequally for doing the same work.   Read our gender pay gap report .    Assistant Chief Constable Di Ro skilly, who is the lead for People Services said: "While we do have a gender pay gap, we are pleased to report that our gender pay gap compares favourably with national figures.   "It is very important to us that we celebrate the contribution both men and women make to policing. Encouraging all our staff and officers, no matter their gender, to progress in their career is something which we continue to focus on.  "We will use this data to understand where we need to focus our efforts in order to close the gender pay gap in the future. We are addressing the gap in a number of ways, which includes work to remove any real or perceived barriers that may be preventing women from progressing their careers.  "Alongside Surrey Police, we became the first police forces worldwide to become Thematic Champions for the ‘HeForShe’ movement for gender equality and as part of this we have pledged our commitment to achieving gender parity in senior leadership roles.  "However we are not complacent and we know we have more to do to improve our diversity. We will continue to work on reducing our gender pay gap, and will report our findings on an annual basis. Some improvements may take longer to implement or take effect, but we are committed to making improvements and working with other forces to share ideas."
