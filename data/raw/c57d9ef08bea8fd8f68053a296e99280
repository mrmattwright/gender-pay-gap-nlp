The Gender Pay Gap statistic does not indicate equal pay – it measures the difference between 
the average pay of all women and the average pay of all men in all jobs in the reference group.  

At Emmanuel Schools Foundation, our approach is simple; we do not discriminate– we pay people 
fairly for the job they are employed to do, regardless of gender. 

Under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations, organisations that employ 
more than 250 people are required to report and publish certain data relating to the pay of men 
and women in that organisation.  

The Regulations set out the methods that employers must use to determine the relevant 
information and specify that the following information must be calculated and reported on both a 
Government website and the organisation’s own website. 

 
 
 
 
 
 

the difference in the mean pay of full-pay men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
the difference in the median1 pay of full-pay men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
the difference in mean bonus of men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
the difference in median bonus pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage; 
the proportion of men and women who received bonus pay; and 
the proportion of full-pay men and women in each of four quartile pay bands. 

The Regulations also specify that the information must relate to a particular period in time. For 
Emmanuel Schools Foundation, this means people employed by the Foundation on 31 March 
2017; and the pay data relates to wages/salary paid in the pay period relating to that specific date 
i.e. salary received in March 2017. 

The Regulations stipulate that “bonus pay” should refer to bonuses paid in the year ending 31 
March 2017. 

We have to report this information no later than 30 March 2018 and annually thereafter. 

                                                           
1 A median is determined by ranking the values by size, and selecting the value in the middle of the list.

How Emmanuel Schools Foundation Compares 

 

The national median gender pay gap as reported by the Office for National Statistics (using the 
Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings figures), is 18.4%. 

In Education, this rises to 26.3%.

Whilst we have a 36.97% median gap overall, it can be seen that within quartiles these pay gaps 
are much lower; underlining the fact that we pay the genders equally in respect of the level at 
which they are employed.  

It should be noted that this is not unusual within our sector http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-
43460998  

However, limiting the data to just full-time employees, the median pay gap in ESF is just 3.67%, 
and nationally the median full-time pay gap is 9.4%.  

This serves to demonstrate that the wider gaps reported both nationally, and locally, are driven by 
a greater proportion of women being employed in part-time roles, which are typically lower paid. 

In the upper quartile, we have a broadly equal split of male to female staff, but in the lower quartile 
85% of staff are female. This is because we have a significant number of women employed in 
lower paid jobs, whilst we have few men employed in those lower paid jobs. 

The effect of career breaks and part-time working to look after children is likely to have affected 
female career progression within the organisation, meaning that men hold a greater proportion of 
the highest-paid roles. In ESF only 13% of the highest paid roles are part-time, compared to 66% 
of the lowest.

  women are more likely than men to have had breaks from work that have affected their career 

progression; 

  women are more likely to work part time, and in ESF as well as across the UK many of the jobs 

that are available on a part-time basis are relatively low paid.

The gender pay gap narrows further when you compare similarly paid jobs. 

In the upper quartile, we have a broadly equal split of male to female staff, and the median pay 
gap here is 6.23% in favour of men. 

In the lowest paid quartile, the gender pay gap of -3.82% meaning that for this group, where 
women represent 85% of employees, on average women are paid more than men.  

The average bonus values indicate a higher median, and mean, for men, but this is skewed by a 
very limited number of bonuses having been paid, and of those that were, only 1 out of the 35 was 
non-contractual. 

What we are doing to address the gender pay gap 

  We plan to review our policy on bonus payments, to address the disparities relating to bonuses; 

  We will continue to work with (for example) maternity returners to identify ways in which female 

staff can continue to contribute at a senior level; 

  We will continue to pay men and women fairly for the work they do, regardless of gender.  

It should be noted, however, that the impact of any consequential changes will not be evident until 
at least our reporting relating to the snapshot date of 31 March 2019.
