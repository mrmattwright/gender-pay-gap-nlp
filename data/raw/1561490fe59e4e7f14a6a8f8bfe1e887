We are therefore committed to encouraging an inclusive working environment with equal opportunities for all” - Andrew Kendrick, Regional President, Europe “Ensuring that we have diversity in the workplace isn’t just the right thing to do, it makes business sense: because developing new ideas and looking at challenges from different angles are critical to our sustained success.” - Giles Ward, Regional President Eurasia and Africa             Why diversity and inclusion is important to us             Our commitment   At Chubb we consider our people our chief competitive advantage and as such we treat colleagues, candidates, clients, and business partners with equality, fairness and respect, regardless of their age, disability, race, religion or belief, gender, sexual orientation, marital status or family circumstances.  We have a dedicated regional Diversity & Inclusion council with senior representatives from across Europe, Eurasia and Africa. Our objective is to drive the continued evolution towards a more inclusive and diverse environment that ensures our employees are treated fairly, can perform to their best ability and are encouraged to share different perspectives.  We will ensure diversity and inclusion initiatives are prioritised, hold our leadership team accountable for progress and facilitate collaboration across the region. Through our strategy we aim to better understand and support our diverse employees, clients and shareholders.      Our strategy    Leaders at the front  Any important initiative needs support from our leaders. Leaders define the change imperative for diversity and inclusion, set the tone for what is important, and make the business case. They set the example for others to follow and behave in ways that reflect and reinforce an inclusive and meritocratic environment.   Each individual has ownership  Change starts with new insights. To become a more inclusive culture, we examine how our views shape mindset and behaviours - both conscious and unconscious. We understand the positive link between an inclusive culture, improved employee engagement, innovation, and ultimately better business results.   Diversity & Inclusion influences how we work across the business  Our culture is the foundation of how things get done. D&I is integral to our culture and as such, employee policies, procedures and systems will reflect this commitment. As a meritocracy, Chubb strives to recruit, develop and retain the best talent.   We make decisions through data insights  Examining our workforce demographics provides a necessary benchmark. Establishing qualitative and quantitative measures allows us to assess progress, hold ourselves accountable and continuously improve. This includes sharing outcomes and driving accountability with the same discipline and rigor as we approach any problem solving.   Clarity in the message  Communication and messaging reinforces our commitment. We aim to have leaders articulate the desired culture clearly, consistently and repeatedly. We plan to showcase successes, stories, best practices, accomplishments, and insights across communication channels.        Our networks   We have a number of networks within the UK and Ireland focused on specific areas within Diversity and Inclusion, sponsored by a member of our Executive team.  Our aim is to broaden the reach of these networks to more locations in the near future.     Gender Equality Network   The Gender Equality Network (GEN) provides opportunities for networking, education and development of business capabilities for all employees, with the aim of driving positive change towards the goal of gender equality within Chubb and the wider insurance industry. "I am committed to inspiring an inclusive culture at Chubb and in my role as executive sponsor I intend to promote and inspire gender equality at all levels within the organisation. I recognise that an effective workplace is one in which all employees feel included. The Gender Equality Network (GEN) has the capabilities to both empower and educate our community, which is why we have decided to rebrand from the Women's Forum to GEN. Further engagement from men will not only expand our scope of possibilities, but it will also ensure GEN's success." Executive sponsor Mark Hammond, Executive Vice President & Chief Finance Officer, Europe, Eurasia and Africa    Parents and Carers   The Parents and Carers Network aims to further develop a supportive culture to enable parents and carers to successfully integrate a fulfilling working life and family responsibilities. “I am delighted to endorse Chubb’s Parents and Carers Network as executive sponsor.  Being a former carer and a current parent myself, I truly appreciate how difficult and challenging it can be to juggle a successful work and home life.  As a network, our main aim is to provide support and guidance to our employees to enable them to perform to the best of their ability both at home and work. I believe this is crucial and will greatly contribute to the success of the business.”  Executive sponsor David Robinson, Executive Vice President & President, UK & Ireland    Social Mobility   Through the work of the Social Mobility network, we are developing and promoting a culture of inclusion and equality, where access to internal and external opportunities at Chubb are open to all, regardless of background. “I’m incredibly excited to be executive sponsor for the Social Mobility Network, as it is an area I feel very strongly about.  It’s clear that as a business we need to reflect the diversity of our clients in order to best represent them.  And we need to ensure we have an inclusive culture that nurtures variety of thoughts and perspectives so that we deliver continued innovation and relevance in the market. The activities we focus on in this stream are centred on removing barriers and fostering fairer social mobility so that opportunities within Chubb are open to all, which I genuinely believe will contribute to the future success of the business”. Executive sponsor Eileen Castolene, Senior Vice President & Director of Operations, Europe, Eurasia and Africa    Awareness and Engagement   Our work is dedicated to promoting Diversity and Inclusion, ensuring all employees understand why it is important to our business and how this focus will lead to improved business outcomes. "People are at the heart of Chubb’s diversity and inclusion initiatives. For that reason alone I am incredibly proud to be executive sponsor of the Awareness and Engagement work stream. I am inspired every day by the people I work with and want to play an active role in ensuring that all our staff are treated fairly and respectfully, have equal access to opportunities and resources, and are empowered to contribute fully to Chubb’s success. We all have a role in creating a workplace that recognises, values and leverages the full range of our individual differences to promote innovation and relevance in the market." Executive sponsor Ashley Mullins, Senior Vice President & General Counsel, Europe, Eurasia and Africa    Abilities and Wellbeing   We are committed to increasing awareness of the importance of employee wellbeing and promoting an acceptance and openness about ability and mental wellness within the organisation. "I am honoured to be the executive sponsor of the Abilities & Wellbeing Network, as it is an area that I feel very passionately about. I think it is extremely important that Chubb adopts and embraces this worthwhile network that will be run by employees. We will focus on promoting acceptance and openness surrounding ability and mental wellness within the organization. Our aim is to build a culture that supports and recognizes peoples individuality, which I believe is key to the success of the business as we move forward." Executive sponsor Steve Parry, Claims Director, Europe, Eurasia and Africa       Within the UK, Chubb is a founding member of the Gender Inclusion Network for Insurance, in collaboration with a number of organisations across the insurance market. We also support the Insurance Cultural Awareness Network and the LGBT Insurance Network .      Our partnerships   We are corporate sponsors of the following charities and networks, leveraging their expertise to advise our Diversity and Inclusion initiatives and providing our employees access to resources and events                    Gender pay gap report    UK employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish their gender pay gap by April 2018. Our aim is to provide a work environment that fosters and encourages a high level of contribution from all employees and we welcome the opportunity to report our gender pay gap. We have put a number of actions in place towards building a more gender-balanced workplace and this first report will act as our benchmark when measuring future progress.
