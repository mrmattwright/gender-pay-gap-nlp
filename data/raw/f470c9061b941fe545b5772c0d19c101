Story Contracting is a fast-growing business and we have ambitious plans for the future.    

We know that we are successful because of the skills, commitment and professionalism of 
our people who achieve great results through their hard work and dedication.  In return, we 
aim  to  be  an  employer  of  choice  and  offer  opportunities  and  reward  which  enable  and 
encourage our people to achieve their full potential.   

We work in a traditionally male-oriented industry but as a family business our values are an 
integral part of who and what we are.  We are committed to being at the forefront of change 
and will be working to increase the representation of women at all levels across the business.  
As a smaller company, we can’t offer the high number of opportunities which some of our 
competitors do, but we are committed to ensuring that we are a progressive employer. Not 
only does this make business sense but it opens the pool of excellent candidates available to 
us. 

We  accept  that  there  are  challenges  ahead  but  this  is  just  the  beginning  and  we  are  fully 
committed to embracing change and promoting the way ahead at #Team Story.

3.0  What does the gap mean? 
 

We recognise that our gender pay gap shows that on average men are paid more than 
women in Story Contracting.  It is clear however that the gap is not because of an equal 
pay issue.  We ensure that men and women are paid equally for doing the same job.   
 
At all levels within the Company, we employ more men than women – 86.41% male 
compared with 13.59% female across the Company as a whole – and this contributes

to our gender pay gap.    This report provides information about Story Contracting as 
a whole but the gap differs across the business depending upon the services provided 
as this impacts on when hours are worked and the payment of premium rates. 
 
In relation to payment of bonuses, on average women receive a higher bonus payment 
than men.  This is due to differences in the way in which our bonuses are calculated 
and  paid.    We  have  two  bonus  schemes:  the  first  is  for  some  of  our  front-line 
colleagues,  99.7%  of  whom  are  male.    It  is  calculated  on  hourly  rate  of  pay  and 
individual performance; the second is for office-based and managerial colleagues and 
is based on a percentage of salary as well as personal and business performance. Most 
of our female colleagues are employed in office-based roles and therefore entitled to 
participate in the second bonus scheme which has a higher overall entitlement. 
 

4.0  How are we addressing the gap? 
 

We take our responsibility for dealing with the gender pay gap identified very seriously 
and are working on strategies which will help us to do so.  These include: 

 

•  Recruiting graduates and apprentices to support the future of the business and 
to  ensure  a  more  diverse  workforce,  encouraging  more  applications  from 
women for roles which are traditionally male-oriented in our sector.  Last year 
we employed two Graduate Engineers both of whom are female and thriving 
in their roles; 

•  Providing opportunities for future generations and young women to see our 
company as a positive place to work, through our involvement with initiatives 
and  networks  such  as  ‘Dream  Placement’  and  STEM  (science,  technology, 
engineering and mathematics); 

•  Reviewing  our  HR  policies  to  ensure  that  they  encourage  women  into  our 
business,  provide  family-friendly  support  for  all  our  working  parents  and 
confirm that Story Contracting is a great place to work; 

•  Working with our customers and other companies to collaborate on how we 
can address gender gaps across the sector and look for ways to improve the 
opportunities available to a more diverse group.
