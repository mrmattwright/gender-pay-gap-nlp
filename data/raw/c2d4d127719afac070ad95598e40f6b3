Equality  Equality is the framework that enables opportunity, access, participation and contribution that is fair and inclusive.  Diversity  Diversity is the acknowledgement and respect of differences within and between groups of people. From that acknowledgement and respect, improvements to services and employment arrangements may be identified and implemented.  The Equality Act 2010  In October 2010 the Equality Act came into effect. Prior to this time there had been over 100 pieces of legislation covering equalities protections and alongside them there are three associated public duties for race, gender and disability. The Equality Act has nine protected characteristics defined as:   Age  Disability  Gender  Gender Reassignment  Marriage and Civil Partnership  Pregnancy and Maternity  Religion or belief – this includes lack of belief  Sexual Orientation  Ethnicity/Race     Workforce Race Equality Standard  NHS England have incorporated the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) into the 2015/16 NHS Standard Contact.  The standard requires organisations to demonstrate progress against a number of indicators of workforce equality.  Our results and associated action plan are published below.

Gender Pay Gap legislation requires all employers of 250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap as at 31st March.  Employers with 250 employees and over are required to publish the following information annually for all employees who are employed under a contract of employment. This will include those under Agenda for Change terms and conditions, medical staff and very senior managers. All calculations should be made relating to the pay period in which the snapshot day falls.  For the first year, this will be the pay period including 31 March 2017.  Required reporting:   calculate the hourly rate of ordinary pay relating to the pay period in which the snapshot day falls  calculate the difference between the mean hourly rate of ordinary pay of male and female employees, and the difference between the median hourly rate of ordinary pay of male and female employees  calculate the difference between the mean (and median) bonus pay paid to male and female employees  calculate the proportions of male and female employees who were paid bonus pay  calculate the proportions of male and female employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands by number of employees rather than rate of pay  The attached data is based on a snapshot date of 31st March 2017. The information is sourced from the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) system, which holds our employee data. The information has also been submitted to the Governments Gender Pay Gap reporting portal (click here for full document) and will be monitored through our workforce governance structure.   Gender Pay Gap Board Report 29 March 18  Equality Delivery System  Bolton NHS Foundation Trust uses the Equality Delivery System (EDS) initiated by the Department of Health that helps trusts to deliver against their statutory requirements in promoting equality and valuing the diversity of its staff and service users.  A refreshed version of EDS2 was introduced in November 2013.

Advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it.  Foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it.   By publishing relevant equality information it is envisaged that it will make public boards more transparent about their decision-making processes and accountable to their service users. It also aims to give the public the information they need to be able to hold public bodies accountable for their performance on equality.  Bolton NHS Foundation Trust publishes the following reports that demonstrate our compliance:   Workforce Monitoring Report  Patient Experience Reports  Annual Reports   Annual Service Delivery report 16- 17 [872kb] PDF  Annual Workforce EDI report 2016 to 2017 [1.63mb] PDF  EDI Annual Report 2016 to 2017 [383kb] PDF  The specific duties in the Equality and Diversity system, contribute to our demonstrating compliance with the public sector duties.

Details of training available can be found in the Training Directory below.   Training Directory [2.11mb] PDF   The Trust has e-learning packages in place for equality and diversity general awareness and promoting understanding.    Equality Impact Assessment  Equality Impact Assessments are carried out for all policies and procedures as well as services.  This ensures that EIAs are integrated and used in policy making and service development activities.  EIA is a tool that helps us to ensure our policies and activities do what they are intended to do and for everybody.   EIAs identify any actions that need to be taken to promote equality.   Carrying out an EIA proforma involves systematically assessing the likely or actual effect of the policies on people in respect of the nine protected characteristics.  If any adverse impacts are identified steps can be taken to remove them.    Equality and Diversity Good Practice  It is important that staff are able to understand the diverse needs of different cultures and customs. The ‘Getting it Right for Everyone’ document provides guidance on communicating with different groups, so that we recognise and value the difference between people.
