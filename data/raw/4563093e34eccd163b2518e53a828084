National Trust Images/Chris Lacey          Twitter  Facebook  Pinterest  Google+  Email        We’ve published our gender pay gap data, as required under government regulations, which measures the difference between the average hourly rate paid to men within an organisation and the average hourly rate paid to women.    The mean gender pay gap at the National Trust is 12.8 per cent in favour of men, based on hourly rates. This is below the national mean average of 17.4 per cent.  The National Trust employs more women than men at all levels of the organisation, with an overall split of 66 per cent women, 44 per cent men. This includes senior levels, where 55 per cent are women. However, in our lower-graded roles such as retail, catering and cleaning 72 per cent are women, leading to an overall gender pay gap.  In order to reduce the gender pay gap:   We are ensuring that men and women have equal opportunity to work at every level of our organisation.  We continually review our people policies and practises to ensure gender equality throughout all grades.  We will review recruitment processes to make all roles relevant and attractive regardless of gender.   Tina Lewis, Director of People and Legal Services, said: 'The National Trust pays men and women the same amount for doing the same work.  'We employ more women than men at all levels of our charity, half our executive team are women and our past, present and new Director General are all women. At senior levels, 55 per cent of workers are women.  'The pay gap exists because we employ more women in lower paid roles, such as retail, catering and cleaning, where the overwhelming majority of applicants have traditionally been women.  'We’re looking at ways we could close the pay gap, including reviewing our recruitment policies to ensure all our roles are equally attractive to men and women.'
