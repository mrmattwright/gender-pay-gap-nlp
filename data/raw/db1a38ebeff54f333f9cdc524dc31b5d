In accordance with Government legislation, all employers with over 250 
employees are required to publish Gender Pay Gap figures. The Government 
has done this because figures show on average, women are paid 9.1% less than 
men in the UK (ONS 2017).  This has been attributed to a multitude of factors, 
however by Employers publishing their figures, the Government intends there 
to be greater transparency which in turn can increase the likelihood of change, 
which Benefit supports.   So that our Customers and interested Parties 
however can fully understand and see the full picture behind these figures, we 
have prepared some short background information below.

What is a Gend(cid:31) Pay Gap?

A Gender Pay Gap is a way to measure the pay differences between men and 
women.  It looks at an employee workforce as a whole, so it is important to 
note that this is not the same as unequal pay for a woman doing the same role 
as a male.  

O(cid:28) fig(cid:28)es

MEAN GENDER PAY GAP; 20%
This figures shows that on average across our workforce, the hourly rate for 
women was 20% less than it was for men. 
 
With only 16 men to base our figures upon, any unique payments to any such 
individual could significantly skew the results.  One such payment was made - 
without this, the gap would have reduced to a mean of 16%.

MEDIAN GENDER PAY GAP; 31%
With a median figure, we essentially put all our employees in a line by gender 
in order of their hourly rate, and find the person right in the middle.  This figure 
therefore places less emphasis on the highest and the lowest hourly rates.  

As a Retailer, a large proportion of our roles are shop floor based which tend 
to be paid at a lower level than across Head Office/Field Based roles. Out of 
the 207 in store, only three are men.

If we were again to line up all our employees by order of their hourly rate, then 
break the line down into four equal sections, it would look like this;

B(cid:27)us

MEAN BONUS GENDER PAY GAP; 27%
MEDIAN BONUS GENDER PAY GAP; 11%

As per the guidelines given, we have looked at the total bonus payments given 
to staff over a 12 month timeline, with each employee given the same 
weighting.   Only 48% of women had a full 12 months worth of bonus 
payments, compared to 87% of men - largely due to higher turnover in store 
based roles, which women are more represented in.

The difference in the proportion of males and females receiving a bonus 
payment however is very minimal;

N(cid:26)t steps

Benefit remains committed to furthering the opportunity and encouragement 
to allow women to pursue whichever career path they wish.  We recognise 
however that the UK wide gender pay gap is a result of many different factors, 
including some that are ingrained in societal norms and values.  There will 
therefore not be an overnight change, however we plan to help move forward 
by following the below steps;

FAMILY FRIENDLY 

POLICIES 

Flexible working hours 

are something we offer to 

our Head Office 

employees, and we are 

increasing the number of 
part time roles available 
at a senior level.  We also 

offer a flexible benefits 
package so that those 

employees who are family 

focused can choose 

benefits that can support 

them.

TALENT PIPELINE

We currently run a 

‘Passport to Success’ 

development scheme to 

enable employees to 

progress from one level in 
the Business to the next. 

We also offer 

Apprenticeships and 
Graduate Schemes to 

further develop 

progression particularly 

for Head Office staff

REWARD & 
RECOGNITION
We have a stringent 

annual salary review that 

ensures all employees’ 
salaries are in line with 
their role and awarded 

fairly.

I confirm the information above is correct and compiled in accordance with 
regulation.
