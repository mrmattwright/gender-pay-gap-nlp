We are committed to developing the local educational landscape within our primary and secondary schools through our unique autonomous model. We firmly believe that through collaboration and supportive challenge we can continue to support and develop further our academy Head Teachers and our Local Governing Bodies (LGB) to manage their own academies through our unique model. ​We are also registered as an academy sponsor for other schools or academies who may approach us and we aim to help them to improve their standards and performance through our supportive model of leadership and school improvement. We fully expect all schools and academies to give their expertise as well as take support from the Trust, as and when required. Gareth Nelmes Chief Executive Officer .
