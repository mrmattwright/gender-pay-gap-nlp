Sustainability  Paperless – We have been a 90% paperless office environment for over 10 years and continue to find ways to reduce it further.   Recycling - At First Response Finance we have a recycling scheme in place to reduce our carbon footprint. We use Shred-It for secure paper shredding and document destruction services and we use Biffa for waste management and additional recycling.   Shred It  Biffa  Solar Energy - We have installed solar panels on two of our offices in order to keep electricity usage down and contribute to helping the environment. This is the first of many ‘green initiatives’ we will be undertaking over the coming years.   Charity  First Response Finance has always tried to support local charities as we know the money raised will make a real difference. We are currently supporting the charity Magic Breakfast, a charity focused on providing primary school children with a healthy breakfast each morning.  Each staff member at First Response Finance has the opportunity to have breakfast in the office - a selection of juices, cereals, bread and pastries - for a small donation. The office also provides fizzy drinks for staff members to purchase at a small donation price which goes directly to charity. All of these donations go to Magic Breakfast and so far the money we have raised has fed over 2,000 children!   Magic Breakfast   Gender Pay  We've created a full PDF document showing a breakdown of the gender pay gap across the business.
