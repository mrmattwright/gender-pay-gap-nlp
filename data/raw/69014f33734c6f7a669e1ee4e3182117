Introduction
Rightmove is passionate about our people so a transparent, 
fair and diverse culture is important to us.  We believe that 
everyone should be judged based on their talent, not on a label.
It’s important to recognise that 
This year, for the first time, UK 
gender is just one aspect of diversity 
companies with over 250 people 
have to report on their gender pay 
and we are committed to a fair and 
gap.  The gender pay gap is the 
equal environment for all.
difference between the average 
earnings of all male and female 
employees in the workforce. It is 
distinct from equal pay, which is 
about ensuring that men and women 
are paid the same for carrying out 
work of equal value. We are confident 
that all Rightmover’s are paid equally 
for doing the same jobs across the 
business and we recruit and promote 
the best people.  

much still to do to achieve gender 
balance across all our teams.
Technology is a sector blighted by a 
lack of diversity, but accepting the 
status quo is not in our DNA.  Here 
we publish our gender pay data 
and some of the initiatives we have 
underway for improving our gender 
balance going forward.

Rightmove is people.  A diverse 
Rightmove is important to us and  
we recognise that a diverse team will 
provide a wide range of perspectives 
that promotes innovation and 
business success. Drawing on what 
is unique about individuals adds 
value to the way we do business and 
helps us anticipate and provide what 
our customers want from us and 
what home hunters want from the 
Rightmove platforms. 
We have achieved a nearly 50:50  
male : female balance of employees 
at Rightmove. However, we have

Understanding Rightmove’s 
gender pay data
The gender imbalance across some of our teams is what strongly 
influences our gender pay gap. Typically women are under-represented 
in more highly paid leadership and technology roles and men in 
customer experience.

Operational Leadership
Operational leadership roles at Rightmove are predominantly held by men. When 
looked at through the lens of the Hampton-Alexander review we are encouraged 
to see that we are ahead of the FTSE 250 female leadership representation 
averages.  In April 2017 37.5% of the Rightmove Board were female, with one 
female and two male executive directors. Notwithstanding this, we continue to 
focus on this area throughout the organisation.

Product & Technology
As a sector, technology notoriously struggles with gender balance.  Similar to 
other companies in our industry we have fewer women in our highly paid technical 
roles. We have now achieved an equal gender split within our technical team 
leader positions which bodes well for our internal talent pipeline.

Customer Experience
Our customer experience team, 
based in Milton Keynes, typically 
attracts over three  female 
applicants for each 
male applicant.  As a 
result the team is 
comprised mainly 
of females.  We 
have implemented 
measures that we 
believe will change 
the structural 
imbalance of 
applicants 
over time.

Taking action to balance our teams
We are committed to a number of actions to balance teams in a fair and transparent way.
Balance for all
• We have developed maternity and 
paternity workshops to support 
Rightmovers through the changing 
dynamic of family and work 
responsibilities and their return to work 
after a career break
• We recognise that balancing work and 
life commitments can make people 
shy away from taking the next step 
in their career.  New flexible working 
arrangements have been rolled out for 
all employees

Addressing imbalance
• We are developing a mentoring 
programme to support career 
development. We aim to exceed the 
Hampton-Alexander review target 
of 33% of the leadership team being 
female by 2020
• We are creating an internal talent 
pipeline to promote the next 
generation  of leaders
• We have launched a graduate 
programme in technology to attract 
the best new talent to help create 
balance in our technology teams over 
the longer term
• We have reviewed all job specifications 
and updated the format of our 
recruitment days in order to guarantee 
universal appeal and attract the 
best talent
