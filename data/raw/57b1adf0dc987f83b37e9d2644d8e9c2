A Constellation of Leading Teaching Communities            Welcome to The Constellation Trust  Our Trust includes primary, secondary and an alternative provision school working together to provide the best learning opportunities for the pupils within our network of schools. Each school serves its own community and has its own unique identity. Together we benefit from working in partnership, share good practice and have a joint central service support team.  Our focus is on continual school improvement to ensure that all children are afforded the best possible opportunities to achieve and exceed their potential. Our schools are at differing stages on the journey to being judged or sustaining the Ofsted judgement of "Outstanding". As a collective we have the capacity to support each other. Our Teaching School, Blueprint Alliance adds to our capacity and the expertise available to Trust schools. Training our own staff through our School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) provision has ensured we recruit and retain high calibre teachers who enjoy working within our organisation.  Our Trust prides itself on providing a friendly, caring, family of schools where everything we do is for the benefit of the children and families that we serve. We encourage pupils to have a ‘love of learning’ so that they become life-long learners and achieve to the very best of their abilities.  The Constellation Trust is a forward thinking and innovative organisation where a passionate and dynamic team work together to maximise opportunities in the best interest of our pupils. Together we made a difference.  I look forward to welcoming you to The Constellation Trust.
