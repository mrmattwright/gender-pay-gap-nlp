The Councils Current Employment Profile – April 2017 
 
All workforce information has been taken from the Councils HR information system, Trent. 
The information collated below is a snapshot of the workforce, as at April 2017, giving 
comparative data (Where possible) to previous years to identify any trends across the 
periods.

Employee numbers had been falling since 2007; however in April 16 the headcount had 
increased by 10 and the FTE by 2.13 this was the first rise in over 5 years. The most 
recent information shows both Headcount and FTE reducing again, headcount is at the 
same level as in April 15, the FTE is lower at 301.12. 
 
 
 
The table below gives a breakdown of Council numbers showing head count and (FTE),

2. Gender and Work Patterns 
 
We have a full time workforce of 251 (74%) employees and 88 (26%) part time employees. 
The percentage of full time and part time workers has remained the same since 
December. 
 
The gender split is 60.2% female and 39.8% male, which is a 1.2% change towards 
female since last year.  
 
The figures for last April were a full time workforce of 257 (73.6%) employees and 92 
(26.4%) part time employees. The gender split was 59% female and 41% male; the gender 
split had increased over the last two years to April by 3% 
 
 
The proportion of male full time workers had been falling since 2013 from 40.1% to 35.8% 
in April 2016 a drop of 4.3%; this has continued for the current period with the drop now 
standing at 4.7% for the current period (this is due to changes in overall numbers and not 
to increase or decrease in male full time staff).  
 
Male part time figures which had been decreasing (dropping by 2.8% to 2.1% in April 
2015) had significantly increased back to 5.2% (this is nearly the same level as April 
2013), however this has now started dropping again and is currently at 4.4%.  
 
Both female part time and full time figure have increased this period, this is mainly due to a 
reduction in the number of staff as opposed to any increase in female staff members. 
 
 
 
 
The figures for local government (source office for national statistics) are full time 
employees 64%, part time employees 36%, male part time 9% and female part time 27%. 
 
 
The tables below show information on male and female full time and part time working 
since 2014.

4. Length of Council Service 
 
Staff numbers have reduced by 10 since last April; this is the same amount as in April 
2015. 
 
There have been significant changes in the first three groups on the table (the 3 groups 
with 10 years or less of service), with -17, +18 and -15 respectively. Part of this is due to 
staff moving between groups, (most notably the less than a year and the 1 to 5 year 
groups) and a number of fixed term contracts coming to completion. 
 
 
The average length of service is 10.9 years (down from 11.4 in April 16). This will be the 
first year it has reduced, previously it remained the same for 2 periods in a row and before 
that it had been increasing by 6 months each year. 
 
 
The majority of our staff (52%) has between 1 and 10 years’ service. This is a 3% 
decrease since April 16 (55%), the figure had been steadily dropping over the previous 
four years, 62% (2012), 58% (2013), 56% (2014) and 54% (2015 April), until the slight rise 
in April 16, it has now started reducing again at approximately the previous 2% to 3% drop 
each year. 
 
 
Out of all the groups the 1 to 5 years group is the largest with 25.66% of the workforce, 
this is an increase of 7.04% from last April’s figure of 18.62%.   
 
 
The figures in brackets show the change (in head count) in that group from the previously 
reported period.

since 2011/12). It had been increasing year on year since 2011/12 when it was 4.9% to a

7. Turnover  
 
Our turnover rate for this period is 14.7% this is a 5% decrease since last period (2015/16) 
when the figure was 19.7%, the rate had been generally increasing since 2009/10 mainly 
due to the financial conditions and requirements to cut costs and reduce budgets.  
 
Our current ratio is similar to that from 2014/15 when we had the same number of staff 
(339). 
 
The national average for turnover for local government is 13.6% (Source: Office for 
National Statistics).

Our gender split is 60.2% female and 39.8% male, this is a change of 1.2% (increase in 
females and decrease in males) over the period. The latest nationally reported statistics for 
local government (source: Office for National Statistics) are 53% for females and 47% for 
males.

The percentage of females in the top 5% of earners has increased since April 16 and is 
currently 4.4% higher at 41.2 as opposed to 36.8% last period. This is due to more female 
staff now in the top 5%.   
 
The average council salary is £24,539, the average female salary is £22,357 and for 
comparison the average male salary is £27,796. The gender split of the workforce will 
have an affect on these figures; more females (60.2%) as opposed to males (39.8%) will 
reduce the female salary figure.

The number of ethnic minority staff in the top 5% of earners increased to 5.8% from 5.5% 
last period, however there are no additional staff in this group the increase is down to 
changes in overall staff numbers. 
 
The overall percentage for the council has decreased to 6.7%. We have 25% of staff that 
have declined to specify their ethnic origin this period; this is an increase of 3% from last 
period (22%), which was an increase of 2% on the previous year (20%). 
 
The latest ethnic figure for Local Government nationally is 8.4% (source: National 
Statistics) we are currently at 7.0%. The Hastings minority ethnic community is currently 
6.3% (source: National Statistics) of the local population, for comparison the figure for the 
south east is 9.6%.

over the period.
