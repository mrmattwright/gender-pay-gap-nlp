FAIR, UNBIASED, EQUITABLE
WERE FOUNDED AND ON WHICH WE 

THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH WE 
BASE OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS

Thomas Franks Limited are very proud of our reputation and founding principles 
as a fair and principled employer, since our inception in 2004.  Women continue 
to be very well represented at every level of the organisation, including in our 
craft teams, food service staff, operational teams, head office support, senior 
management and on the Board. We are very proud of the fact that women 
make up 69% of our Thomas Franks Team.

As a fair employer, we continue to strive to ensure that all of our recruitment 
processes are fair and equitable and that training and development opportunities 
are accessible to all levels, with our development policies being at the very 
heart of everything we do. 

BELINDA EVANS
DEVELOPMENT CHEF

We have committed in 2018 to developing our own innovative and creative 
chefs with the launch of the Thomas Franks Chef Academy and we are striving 
to  ensure  that  great  talent  continues  to  be  represented  throughout  the 
business structure regardless of gender, with supported training programs and 
apprenticeships, alongside encouraging more flexible working hours to meet 
the needs of modern family life and to make work accessible for women (or 
men) who make the decision to return to the workplace. 

Whilst hospitality remains a service sector which has a reputation for unsociable 
working hours and demanding expectations, we have female staff at every level 
who succeed and through development, continue to push back the boundaries 
of this traditionally male dominated workplace. 

We are committed to continuing with this trend towards greater equality of 
both achievement and opportunity. In Thomas Franks, we have always paid 
equal rates of pay, regardless of gender or age and we will always strive to do 
so. We will continue to work hard to ensure that diversity, equality and fairness 
is applied in every aspect of our business life.
