We welcome the opportunity to report our gender pay gap under The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  EQUALITY  With effect from April 2017 The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 require any business with more than 250 staff to report its gender pay gap. As a business we are fully supportive of this and encourage all efforts to ensure that there is gender equality in all businesses throughout the UK.  When deciding on remuneration for staff, we will never take into account gender and will determine pay based solely on the job role.  The Gender Pay Gap is the difference between the average earnings for men and women for example; 'Men earn 17% more than women each year'.  The report includes:   Our mean gender pay gap  Our median gender pay gap  Our mean bonus gender pay gap  Our median bonus gender pay gap  Our proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  Our proportion of males and females in each quartile band  Gender breakdown by grade  Our future plans for gender pay   How to View Our Report  We are required to publish information on the gender pay gap, why it exists and what we intend to do to close it. We must also provide a written statement detailing that all the information presented is correct.
