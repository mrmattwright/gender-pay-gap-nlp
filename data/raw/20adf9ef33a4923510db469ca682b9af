Gender Pay Figures  The information below shows our mean and median pay gaps, the bonus pay gap, the proportion of men and women in each quartile pay band, and the proportions of our employees who received a bonus in the year to 5th April 2017.      Pay and Bonus Gap                  Mean    Median      Gender Pay Gap    7.3%    0.0%      Bonus Gap    2.1%    10.2%            Proportion of employees receiving a bonus          Women    4.4%      Men    3.6%            Proportion of men and women in each Quartile Band              Lower Quartile    Lower Middle Quartile    Upper Middle Quartile    Upper Quartile      Women    79.7%    81.1%    85.4%    75.3%      Men    20.3%    18.9%    14.6%    24.7%       Understanding the Gender Pay Gap  Colten Care Ltd has more female employees (80.4%) than male employees (19.6%), which is broadly representative of the health and care sector as a whole.  The company applies equal pay across each of its job groups.  Despite a disparity in numbers of male and female employees we have no median pay gap and the mean pay gap of 7.3% is significantly lower than the ONS mean pay gap of 17.4%.  A smaller proportion of men than women work in positions where a bonus was payable in April 2017.  The mean or average bonus paid overall is very similar between men and women illustrating that our bonus processes are gender neutral.  The difference in the median bonus is due to a much smaller number of men earning bonus compared to women, and the bonus paid at the median for men being in a middle management technical role, with the job paid at the median for women being at a slightly less responsible, operational role.  The proportion of women and men across the pay quartiles is reasonably even, except for the Upper Middle Quartile where the proportion of women increases to 85.4% (against the overall average of 80.4%), and in the Upper Quartile where the proportion of men increases to 24.7% (against the overall average of 19.6%).  At the census date there was a higher proportion of men in trades’ positions and in technical support functions, such as IT, Property and Facilities Management.  Colten Care Ltd has policies and initiatives in place which demonstrate a continuing commitment to equality.  I confirm the data reported is accurate.
