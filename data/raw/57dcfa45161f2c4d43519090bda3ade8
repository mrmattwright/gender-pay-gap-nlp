Swann-Morton Limited has calculated the required figures and at the “snapshot” date of 5 April 2017, our gender pay gap data was as follows:  The mean gender pay gap is 36.6%  This means the difference between the average hourly pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage.  The median gender pay gap is 33.3%  This means the difference between the median hourly pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage.  The mean gender bonus gap is 36.6%  This means the difference in average bonus payments received by men and women, expressed as a percentage, and reflects the mean gender pay gap since our bonus payments are salary-based.  The median gender bonus gap is 33.3%  This means the difference in median bonus payments received by men and women, expressed as a percentage, and reflects the median gender pay gap since our bonus payments are salary based.  The proportion of both male and female employees eligible for a bonus is 100%.

Explaining the gender pay gap As an engineering and manufacturing company, the routes of progression through the company have traditionally begun in production and technical areas.  Historically, these areas have been almost exclusively male, and this is still the case today, not only at Swann-Morton but throughout our industry sector.  This is the crucial factor that needs to be taken into consideration when seeking to understand our gender pay gap.
Band A above includes all our directors and senior managers, the majority of whom are men who began working at the company in technical and production roles and progressed into management. Reducing the gender pay gap Swann-Morton Limited is proud to be an equal opportunities employer and does not discriminate on the grounds of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability.
We strive to pay employees equally for the same or equivalent work regardless of their sex or any of the other characteristics set out above.
We recognise that our gender pay gap is above average and wish to address this. Annual pay audits are carried out by the directors with the aim of ensuring equal pay for equal work.
We will try to encourage more women into the company’s technical roles through our apprenticeship scheme.  To this end we will continue to ensure that all departments throughout the company offer an inclusive working environment.
We will also consider whether there are other areas into which we could extend our apprenticeship scheme to encourage female apprentices to apply for employment.
We will keep our recruitment, pay, progression and retention structures under review to ensure that they are fit for purpose, now and in the future.
