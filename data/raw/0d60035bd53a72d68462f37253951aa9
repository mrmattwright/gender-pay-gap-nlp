The College undertook a further Equality and Diversity survey in March 2016 for employees as well as holders of joint appointments with the University of Oxford. The data is available here .  It was noted that the number of Fellows recruited in any one year was small. However, candidates were drawn from an international pool and the College served as a joint employer.  The College subscribes to programmes implemented both at University and national levels which are designed to boost recruitment of academic staff from specific backgrounds.
