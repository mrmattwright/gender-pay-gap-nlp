Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, and as an 
employer with over 250 employees, Yorkshire Causeway Schools Trust is required to measure and 
report on the gender pay gap in the organisation. The Trust is a public sector body and has a data 
capture date of 31 March in each year.  
 
The Trust comprises one secondary academy and five primary academies at 31 March 2017. 
 
Under the Regulations, there is a requirement to report on the following six measures  

1.  The mean gender pay gap, expressed as a percentage 
2.  The median gender pay gap, expressed as a percentage 
3.  The mean bonus gender pay gap 
4.  The proportion of males receiving a bonus payment 
5.  The proportion of females receiving a bonus payment 
6.  The proportion of males and females in each quartile band 

 
The Trust has not paid any bonus payments over the period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 and 
therefore there is no requirement to report on measure 3, 4 and 5 above.  
 
In relation to the other calculations the data is based on 484 employees at the data capture date, 
made up of 94 male employees and 390 female employees. 
 
The calculations are as follow:

In our quartiles we have a higher proportion of women in the lower, lower middle and upper middle 
quartiles. The overall pay gap is therefore due to a higher number of women in junior positions. 

All staff move through pay scales for their grade based on performance, which is monitored 
regularly. Earnings are based on performance in role irrespective of gender. 

 

Further Analysis 

By separating the employees into support staff and teaching staff, the gender pay gap can be 
analysed further. 

Support staff numbers at the data capture date are 268, 55% of the total number of employees. Of 
these support staff 34 are male (15%) and 234 (85%) are female.  

Teaching staff total 216. Of these 72% are female and 28% male

A Mean Pay Gap of 9%. 

 

Teaching Staff Median Pay Gap

A Median Pay Gap of 7%. 

The pay gap is higher for support staff than for teaching staff suggesting that there are a higher 
number of female than male staff in lower paid support roles.  

Yorkshire Causeway Schools Trust is an equal opportunities employer. The Trust supports the fair 
treatment of all staff irrespective of gender. 

These figures provide a baseline to identify pay gap trends and take appropriate action where 
necessary.
