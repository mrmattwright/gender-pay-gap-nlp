There are no differentials at any of the pay quartiles.         As part of the Equality Act 2010 Regulations 2017 employers with 250 or more employees are required to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female staff based on a series of calculations to provide a fair and accurate summary of pay.  Councillor Baggy Shanker, Cabinet Member for Finance and Governance, said:  “I welcome the new Gender pay reporting legislation and this is a positive report which demonstrates our commitment to ensuring equality amongst our workforce.”  Christine Durrant, Acting Chief Executive, said:  “This is the first time we have had to report our figures in this way I am pleased we are very close to gender parity in our pay.
