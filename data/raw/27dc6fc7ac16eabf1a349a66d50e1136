All public-sector organisations must publish a set of figures and information about their gender pay gaps by 30th March 2018 based on the reference date (snapshot date) of the 31st March 2017. The set of figures required include: The difference in the mean pay of full-pay males and females, expressed as a percentage The difference in the median pay of full-pay males and females, expressed as a percentage The difference in mean bonus pay of males and females, expressed as a percentage The difference in median bonus pay of males and females, expressed as a percentage The proportion of males and females who received bonus pay The proportion of full-pay males and females in each of four quartile pay bands  Close      Wiltshire Council in context       Wiltshire Council in context       Wiltshire Council had 4499 relevant staff employed on the snapshot date of 31st March 2017 across a range of services including (but not limited to) adult care, children’s services, education, environmental services, housing as well as support functions such as business support, finance, HR and information technology. In common with public sector organisations as a whole, 69.69% of the workforce is female and 30.31% are male. Wiltshire Council is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, disability or caring responsibilities. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). As a result of this, Wiltshire Council: Carries out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals Provides regular job evaluation training for those involved in carrying out job evaluation Evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure The council uses job evaluation schemes such as the Greater London Provincial Council (GLPC) and Hay schemes to assess the value of jobs across the organisation ensuring equal pay for equal work across roles.  Salaries are paid according to grade band and incremental annual progression within this band occurs irrespective of gender. Wiltshire Council is therefore confident that any gender pay gap does not stem from paying males and females differently for the same or equivalent work.  Any gender pay gap identified is therefore the result of the roles in which males and females work within the organisation (which is largely down to social factors such as females tending to take up part time roles due to caring responsibilities) and the salaries that these roles attract.  Close      Wiltshire Council pay gap data and analysis       Mean and median gender pay gaps       The figures set out below have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. Mean and median gender pay gaps The mean and median pay gaps demonstrate the difference between the mean (average) and median (midpoint) basic annual earnings of males and females expressed as a percentage of the mean or median basic annual earnings of males. Male per hour Female per hour Pay gap Mean £14.43 £13.31 7.81% Median £12.86 £12.00 5.36% The mean gender pay gap for Wiltshire Council is 7.81%.  This means that the average hourly rate for females is £13.31 compared with an average hourly rate for males of £14.43. The median gender pay gap for Wiltshire Council is 5.36%.  This means that the middle hourly rate for females is £12.00 compared with males at £12.68. The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17.4%. Wiltshire Council’s mean gender pay gap is significantly lower than the whole economy figure. The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 ONS ASHE figures) is 18.4% and for the public sector it is 13.1%. Wiltshire Council’s median gender pay gap is significantly lower than the national figure and public sector figure.  Close        Bonus payments       Bonus payments refer to any remuneration in relation to productivity, performance or incentive. Wiltshire Council does not provide performance related pay or bonus schemes.  However, the council does provide the payment of £150 in voucher form to employees achieving 25 years’ service (exclusive to the council) as a long service payment.  This payment is regardless of gender and the only criteria is time served. Bonus payments data for Wiltshire Council is as follows: Pay gap Mean bonus gender pay gap 0.00% Median bonus gender pay gap 0.00% Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment 0.59% Proportion of females receiving a bonus payment 0.53%  Both the mean and median bonus pay gaps are 0% as all those in receipt of a long service award received the same amount of £150 regardless of gender. The proportion of males receiving a bonus payment is 0.59% compared with females at 0.53%. This equates to 23 females and 11 males who received the long service award of £150.  Close             The table shows the proportions of male and female employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands. This shows Wiltshire Council's workforce split into 4 equal parts based on calculated hourly pay rates.         The quartile split       The quartile split for each of the 4 quartiles is broadly in line with our workforce demographics of 69.69% female and 30.31% male.  However, there are slightly more females in the first 3 quartiles and fewer females in the 4th quartile (the upper pay quartile) when compared with the overall workforce.  For there to be no gender pay gap, you would expect to see the workforce demographics (69.69% female and 30.31% male) reflected in each of these quartiles.  Close        Quartile percentages with upper quartile split       As the number of females in the upper quartile is fewer than the workforce split and the other quartiles higher, this suggests that females are predominantly in lower paid roles and the opportunity to take up higher paid roles reduces with higher paid roles made up of predominantly males. This may largely be down to social factors.  Females are more likely than males to have had breaks from work for caring responsibilities that have affected their career progression.  They are also more likely to work part-time, and many of the jobs that are available across the UK on a part-time basis are relatively low paid. In analysing the data further to consider the upper quartile, this quartile has been split in order to understand at what point females begin to significantly reduce.  Close             The table shows that when the upper quartile is split the number of females in the upper half reduces further to 60.14%, further demonstrating that the more senior (and higher paid) role, the less likely these roles are to be undertaken by females.           In analysing the data further to understand how the split of females and males compares to our workforce demographics, the table below shows the proportion of staff by grade and gender across Wiltshire Council's main grades evaluated under the GLPC and Hay job evaluation schemes. With the exception of grade L (XWL), the grades above grade K (XWK) broadly reflect that of Wiltshire Council's workforce demographic (69.69% female and 30.31% male) until grade O (XWO) where this reduces significantly to 55% female and 45% male with the number of females continuing to reduce across the senior (hay graded) roles.  This confirms that identified above with the pay quartiles that females are less likely to undertake higher paid roles.    Addressing the gender pay gap       Addressing the gender pay gap       Although low compared with the national statistics, Wiltshire Council has a gender pay gap as the majority of the workforce is female (69.69%) and predominantly a large proportion of these are employed in the lower quartile pay bands, with fewer employed at the more senior levels.  As Wiltshire Council has a predominately female workforce, small fluctuations in the male workforce can have significant impact on the gender pay gap data and results.  For example, if Wiltshire Council employed more males in the lower pay quartiles this would reduce the gender pay gap further. Wiltshire Council’s gender pay gap could be largely reflective of society.  Across the UK as a whole, males are more likely to be in very senior roles towards the top of an organisation’s structure while females are more likely to be in less senior roles.  Although organisations and society are becoming increasingly flexible, females are more likely to have had breaks from work for example to bring up children or take lifestyle choices that support a caring role away from work, and as a consequence can be in roles which attract a lower salary or lack opportunities for career progression. While Wiltshire Council’s gender pay gap is relatively low, comparing favourably with national statistics, and could be in part a result of society and culture, the council is not complacent and is committed to taking action to reduce the gap. To date, the steps that Wiltshire Council has taken to promote gender diversity in all areas of its workforce include the following: Flexible working and family friendly policies Job evaluation practices Apprenticeships and learning development programmes Equalities groups Recruitment information  Close        Flexible working and family friendly policies       The council currently has a suite of flexible working and family friendly policies and arrangements for employees to promote equal opportunity such as maternity leave, paternity, shared parental leave, adoption leave, childcare vouchers, carers leave, flexible working, homeworking and a range of contract types.  These arrangements are available to all eligible staff and are published on the internal HR website and available as part of the recruitment process. In order to raise greater awareness of these benefits they will now be promoted on the HR website, at the point of recruitment and at new starter induction programmes and there will be a stronger focus on them within the regular communications out to employees on HR related policies and procedures.  The council is in the process of developing an HR communications plan detailing targeted campaigns to focus on specific employment policies and HR topics and the family friendly policies and flexible working arrangements will be included. In addition, the council will use data analytics to monitor employee take up of all family friendly policies and flexible working arrangements, rather than just employees returning from maternity leave.  Close        Job evaluation practices       The council uses robust job evaluation schemes such as GLPC and HAY to ensure roles are graded consistently and jobs evaluated as like work and equivalent work are paid equally.  All new jobs and jobs undergoing review continue to be evaluated using these methods to ensure these robust practices continue across the council.  Close        Apprenticeships and learning development programmes       Wiltshire Council provides apprenticeship opportunities to both new recruits and existing staff to support career progression.  The council provides ‘upskilling’ opportunities for existing staff to enable them to gain a qualification or skills to equip them ready for career progression should an opportunity arise.  As this is a relatively new approach since April 2017, the focus will be on promoting the programme to employees and highlighting the opportunities available. In addition to apprenticeships the council has recently launched a ‘career is my asset’ programme hosting a range of e-learning opportunities for employees to select and attend as they wish. As these programmes continue to develop, the council will monitor data on registration numbers split by the nine protected characteristics.  Close        Equalities groups       The council is firmly committed to the principles of equality and inclusion in both employment and the delivery of its services. The council consults on equality and diversity work across the organisation and continually monitors the effects of employment policies and practices.  The council also has a number of staff networks including the carers and disability network, LGBT network and the BME network which provide an opportunity for issues to be raised and initiatives implemented. The council will build upon these networks in gauging interest in introducing an equalities focus group specifically for women to understand barriers to recruitment and promotion within the workplace.  Close        Recruitment information       Wiltshire Council will continue to use recruitment and induction information in a way that promotes the council as an equal opportunities employer.  The council is aware of the potential for unconscious bias within its recruitment and interviewing process and is currently reviewing these practices and process following results of a recent staff survey which highlighted some wider equality issues. In addition to the measures noted above, Wiltshire Council will develop a process to monitor starting pay both in recruitment and promotion for males and females to assess whether there are differences in the starting pay of different genders.  This will be included in the current process for reporting equalities data.  Close      In conclusion       In conclusion       Wiltshire Council’s mean gender pay gap is 7.81% and the median gender pay gap is 5.36%.  This is significantly lower than the national pay gap of 17.4% and 18.4% respectively. Wiltshire Council is committed to taking action to further improve the pay gap and reporting the progress it is making to reduce the gender pay gap, and will publish an updated report and data on an annual basis.
