This is our report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017:  Mean gender pay gap at NCHA is 19.8%.  Median gender pay gap at NCHA is 23.4%.  Mean gender bonus gap at NCHA is -21.7%.  Median gender bonus gap at NCHA is 0%.  The proportion of male employees in NCHA receiving a bonus is 9% and the proportion of female employees receiving a bonus is 13%. Pay quartiles by gender:     Quartile   Men   Women  Description     A  23.8%  76.2%  Includes all employees whose hourly rate places them at or below the lower quartile.     B  27.5%  72.5%  Includes all employees whose hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but at or below the median.     C  38%  62%  Includes all employees whose hourly rate places them above the median but at or below the upper quartile.     D  47.5%  52.5%   Includes all employees whose hourly rate places them above the upper quartile.   The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. What are the underlying causes of our gender pay gap?  We have identified the following issues that are contributing to the gender pay gap:  Women are under represented in more senior roles at NCHA. Our workforce gender split is 67% women and 33% men. However women occupy only 59% of managerial roles and represent only 52.5% of the upper quartile of our pay bands.  Women are disproportionately over represented in the lowest quartiles (quartile A & B). If there was an even distribution of women across our pay quartiles then we’d expect to see 10% fewer women in quartile A. Gender pay gap is different to equal pay Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. NCHA is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. As such we use a gender neutral job evaluation scheme to grade roles and determine pay. Our gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract. Across the UK economy, men are more likely than women to be in senior roles (especially very senior roles at the top of organisations), while women are more likely than men to be in front-line roles at the lower end of the organisation. Women are also more likely than men to have had breaks from work that have affected their career progression, for example to bring up children. Women are also more likely to work part time, part time work is often concentrated at lower ends of the pay spectrum. This pattern from the UK economy as a whole is reflected in the make-up of NCHA’s workforce, where the majority of front-line staff are women, while the majority of line manager and senior manager roles are held by men. For example 82% of part time staff at NCHA are women but only 18% of roles in the upper quartile of pay (quartile D) are done on a part time basis. How does NCHA’s gender pay gap compare with other organisations? The vast majority of organisations have a gender pay gap, and our pay gap is just above the UK average, and we are advised, likely to be average for the Housing sector. The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17.5%. The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 ONS ASHE figures) is 19.2%. What is NCHA doing to address the gender pay gap?  While NCHA’s gender pay gap is around the UK average we are not complacent about this, and we are committed to doing everything that we can to reduce the gap. To date, NCHA has taken the following steps to promote gender diversity in our workforce:  Enhanced maternity provision to encourage women taking maternity leave to return to work.  Terms and conditions that support work life balance including paid urgent/domestic leave, flexible working and benefits aimed at improving health and wellbeing.  Anonymising applicant data to reduce unconscious bias in recruitment.  Training all managers about unconscious bias.  Monitoring to understand:  the proportions of men and women in managerial roles at NCHA; the proportions women leaving the organisation and their reasons for leaving; the numbers of men and women in managerial roles. This is not a quick fix and it may be several years before we reduce the gender pay gap. In the meantime, we are committed to reporting on an annual basis the impact on reducing the gender pay gap. However NCHA is committed to reducing the gender pay gap and will over the next two years:  review and simplify our pay arrangements  review terms and conditions to see what if any impact this has on the gender pay gap  review how we will increase the representation of women in higher paid roles  work with staff and trade unions to achieve this Published December 2017           Contact Us    Office Locations    Feedback, compliments and complaints    Enquiry / feedback form    Social media    Text messages      About Us    Latest News    Corporate accountability    Corporate plan    Mission and values    Equality and diversity    Executive team    The Board    Regions of operation    Service standards    Pelham Homes    Gender pay gap    Modern slavery act statement    Dementia Plan    Homes for Cathy      Work with NCHA    Current Vacancies    Recruitment Policy    Apprenticeships and other work opportunities    Diversity Champions    Staff Testimonials      Volunteer for us    Training and Skills    Contact us    Find a course    Live and Learn programme    Tenancy skills    Work experience      Publications    Annual reports    Magazines    Performance      Pelham Architects    Housing Development    Staff login           Your online account          Tweets by NCHASalesTeam                  What our customers say                     Tweets by @NottsCommHA        Nottingham Community Housing
