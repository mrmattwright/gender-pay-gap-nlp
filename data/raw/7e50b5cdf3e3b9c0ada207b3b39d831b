We are therefore confident that there is equal pay between both genders for equivalent roles.   Equal Opportunity Employer  UKAD is fully committed to principles of equality of opportunity. UKAD strives to ensure that employees, representatives, partners and job applicants irrespective of their age, gender, disability, race, ethnic origin, nationality, colour, parental or marital status, dependency, pregnancy, religious belief, class or social background, sexual orientation or political belief, will receive fair treatment, equal opportunities and will not be unlawfully excluded.  As at 31 March 2017, 51% of staff were male whereas 49% of staff were female with two of our most senior employees (including the Chief Executive) being female. UKAD acknowledges that we have more males in senior positions than females.  All individuals who work on a casual worker agreement are paid a fixed rate therefore there is no gender pay gap to report.  In line with the 31 March 2017 snapshot date, the following information demonstrates UKAD’s Gender Pay Gap.   The hourly gender pay gap  The below details the mean and median hourly pay gap for employees at UKAD.   Hourly pay difference between males and females (in favour of males)     Mean  Median    0.9%  3.1%       The bonus gender pay gap  The below details the mean and median bonus pay gap for employees at UKAD.   Bonus pay difference between males and females (in favour of males)     Mean  Median    13.4%  6.4%      The difference between the hourly pay gap and the bonus pay gap is because males were scored more highly than females in equivalent roles when their performance was assessed. For future years this aspect will be the subject of review and moderation when performance related pay is assessed.   The proportion of males and females receiving bonus payment    At UKAD, all employees who are in post on 1 December and still in post on 31 March, are entitled to receive a performance related pay bonus of up to 7% of their earnings for that financial year. The bonus percentage that is awarded is dependent on a how an individual performs in their performance development plan (appraisal). All employees entitled to receive a performance related pay bonus in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 received an award.  Female and male relevant employees who were not in post on 1 December and 31 March therefore were not paid performance related pay bonus during the 12-month period ending with the snapshot date, have not been included in the bonus calculations, as per Gender Pay Gap Reporting Regulations. Individuals who work on a casual worker agreement i.e. UKAD Doping Control Personnel and National Trainers do not qualify for performance related pay bonus.   Pay quartiles  The table below details the proportion of males and females in each of the four salary quartiles.    A higher proportion of males in the higher quartile can again be attributed to there being more males in senior positions. However, the above demonstrates that there are more males than females in the lower middle quartile and fewer males than females in the upper middle quartile.
