The company is required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act  2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.   This Gender Pay Gap Report is based on data as at the 5th April 2017. These figures have been reached using the mechanisms that are set out in the gender pay gap legislation.  All roles within GTA are benchmarked to market using up to date salary information.  When evaluating roles the final outcomes provide a score from which we assign an internal grade which are common across all functional areas.  I am pleased to be able to include information showing analysis across each grade within this publication and I’m encouraged that there are generally small differences between male and female pay at each grade.  At GTA Travel we encourage applications from all gender, disability and ethnic groups and promotion and hiring decisions are always made on the capability and skill of the applicants. Please  see below our company’s equal opportunities statement and recruitment policy statements.  Equal Opportunities Statement  The Company is committed to ensuring that ALL employees are treated fairly and with dignity and respect. No employee shall be treated less favourably on the grounds of their sex, sexual orientation, race, religious belief and marital status or on the grounds of disability without justification.  This statement has been written to protect both employers and employees.  This statement applies, but without limitation, to the following: promotion, training, placement, transfer, dismissal as well as remuneration, grievance and disciplinary procedures and decisions.  Employees should be aware that in certain circumstances should they be guilty of discrimination they may be personally legally liable for their actions.  Recruitment General Principles   All employees involved in the recruitment process should ensure that they have appropriate training. Employees who do not feel adequately trained to conduct recruitment and selection processes should discuss this with their line manager, Talent Acquisition or their HR representative. Employees involved in the recruitment process must be fair and open to all candidates without bias, on the grounds of gender, marital status, pregnancy, race, disability, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, religious or cultural beliefs, age, irrelevant criminal record or trade union activity.  Recruitment and Selection Procedure Purpose  This procedure forms the basis for the implementation of the Recruitment Policy. The procedure has been designed to provide a framework which promotes good practice, adopts a proactive approach to equality and diversity issues and supports GTA’s operational requirements and strategic aims. All employees involved in the recruitment and selection of employees should be aware of and adhere to this procedure. In addition, all recruiting managers must act in accordance with this procedure.  Whilst we encourage a diverse range of applicants, we are limited to the pool of candidates available to us and this often lends itself to a gender bias at more senior levels.  Like many other companies in the UK, our results show a pay gap due to the disparate number of males within senior roles compared to women (64% of males) and the reverse at the lower earning end of the spectrum (68% of females).  Roles at senior levels within GTA Travel often require extensive overseas travel which can discourage women with families to apply.  Within this document, I have also included pay gaps per quartile which indicate that there are much smaller gaps between male and female pay when we drill down into the various levels of pay.  Our median pay gap figure per quartile slide 8 shows that women earn more than men in 3 of the 4 quartiles.  As these more granular pay gaps are much lower than the overall pay gap, we know that the unequal distribution of men and women in senior roles is the main driver for our gender pay gap.  We are confident our gender pay gap is not the result of a systemic equal pay issue, because our pay practices and design include regular gender checks and balances. We have carried out analysis to better understand the causes of our pay gap. Our analysis of pay and bonus suggests any pay gap at different levels is predominantly driven by the structure of our workforce. The driving factor behind our gender pay gap is a higher proportion of men in our senior roles and in certain parts of our business which attract higher market value.
