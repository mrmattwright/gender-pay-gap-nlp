The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women. Companies are also required to publish details of the proportion of men and women in the company who receive bonuses and the breakdown of men and women in different pay quartiles. Snapshot: April 2017 The School is a registered charity and company limited by guarantee under the name of The American School in London Educational Trust Limited. The School supports the fair treatment of all employees irrespective of gender through our transparent recruitment process, pay and professional development. Combined American School in London gender pay gap Some members of the teaching and administrative employees at the School are employees of The American School in London Foundation (the “Foundation”), which is based in the United States and are seconded to The American School in London Educational Trust Limited (the “Trust”) under an agreement between the two companies. We feel that it is a fairer reflection of the operations and pay of the American School in London, to include employees who have been seconded to the School from the Foundation.  Median pay gap Mean pay gap Lower quartile Lower middle quartile Upper middle quartile Upper quartile The American School in London  18.3% 4.3% 46% M 54% F 39% M 61% F 30% M 70% F 46% M 54% F This table shows that the median pay for women is 18.3% higher than for men, and that the mean pay for women is 4.3% higher than for men. Gender pay gap figures for the Trust only  Median pay gap Mean pay gap Lower quartile Lower middle quartile Upper middle quartile Upper quartile Trust 29.3% 7.1% 51% M 49% F 36% M 64% F 41% M 59% F 34% M 66% F  This table shows that the median pay for women is 29.3% higher than for men, and that the mean pay for women is 7.1% higher than for men. This is because the Trust employs more women teachers than men. All teachers, whether employed by the Trust or the Foundation, are paid according to the same pay scale.  Median bonus pay gap Mean bonus pay gap Proportion receiving bonus payment Trust 175% 43% 5% M 3% F This table shows that the median bonus pay for women is 175% higher than for men, and that the mean bonus pay for women is 43% higher than for men. Only 5% of men received a bonus, and 3% of women. This is because bonuses are restricted to a few employees only—our housekeeping staff—based on their attendance. For year ending April 2017, the mean annual bonus paid was £1,245. Supporting statement I can confirm that the above information has been prepared from our payroll data on the snapshot date and fairly presents the gender pay gap information for The American School in London Educational Trust Limited.
