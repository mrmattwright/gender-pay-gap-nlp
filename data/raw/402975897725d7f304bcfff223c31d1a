Tapi’s Gender Pay 
Gap

At +9.3% our mean gap compares favourably 
with both the retail sector (+16.4%) and the UK 
(+17.4%) as a whole.

Our median gap at +5.2% also fares well 
against the comparable markers for our sector 
and the UK.

Whilst the fact that both these figures infer that 
men across our company earn more than 
women this is in a greater part due to a 
disproportionately larger percentage of males 
in the company, who also occupy the more 
senior roles.

Tapi is acutely aware of this disparity and is 
actively seeking to address this gap.

(Data for Retail and UK have been taken from the estimated ASHE gender pay gap 
tables 2017, as published by the Office for National Statistics)

Tapi’s Bonus Gap

Our bonus pay gap of 31% mean and 
66% median is reflective of more men 
filling senior positions, particularly at 
store level.

Our commission based structure within 
our retail sales team, leads to higher 
earning potential among senior store 
staff.
