This is the first year of employers having to report on gender pay gap and we will do this every year. Gender pay gap reporting is not the same as paying men and women equally for doing like-for-like work – we are confident that we do this – but is about looking at the distribution of men and women through all pay levels of the organisation, the hours they work, and the effect this has on average hourly rates of pay.  Why is this important?  It is important that we have a diverse workforce that brings as wide a range as possible of skills, experience, and knowledge to the work we do. We want to encourage a balance of men and women in the workplace, and we want to take into account new attitudes to work that many people have – for example: parttime vs full-time working, career plans, secondments or career breaks. When we recruit new employees we always look for the best candidate for the job – irrespective of gender – but we have to watch that the way we structure our jobs and hours of work do not encourage or discourage either men or women more favourably.  What we were asked to look at  For gender pay gap reporting we are asked to look at: • The balance of men and women across our employees overall, and in four equal-sized groups when ranked by pay (“quartiles”); • The difference (as a percentage) between the average pay men and women receive (the “mean gender pay gap”); • The difference (as a percentage) between the median pay men and women receive (the very mid-point of the pay rates – the “median gender pay gap”)  Employers are asked to do separate calculations in terms of ‘ordinary’ pay (which includes allowances, some of which do not apply to everyone), and ‘bonus’ pay. Because we do not offer bonuses we only report on ‘ordinary pay’.  Key findings  Our mean gender pay gap is: 15.4%  The average hourly rate paid to women is 15.4% less than men. The Scottish average is 15% less.  Our median gender pay gap is: 21.4%  The median hourly rate paid to women is 21.4% less than men.

There are proportionally more jobs in our lower pay brackets which are also part-time. There is a better gender balance in our more senior roles.  What we’re doing to encourage gender balance in the workplace  The majority of our lower-paid roles are property-based and part-time/part-year. Whilst rates of pay do not vary whether an employee is part-time/part-year, this type of working may have appealed in the past more to females than males. A review of the business model for property operations has proposed more properties to open for longer ‘seasons’ with the potential consequence of attracting employees looking for year-round employment. In turn this may see a more balanced workforce of females and males, with the consequence of addressing the median gender pay gap and the lower quartile challenges.  We have introduced a number of new training interventions to support recruiting line managers as they are required to make recruitment decisions based on suitability for the job (against stated job criteria as opposed to gender, or any other protected characteristic). These include mandatory online learning modules on Unconscious Bias and Equality & Diversity, and refreshed face-to-face Recruitment training for managers who have not attended such a module within the six months prior to recruitment interviews.  We are exploring the best way to open and promote career paths and succession planning for our workforce, so that individuals who already work for us can see a route for their career development through roles at different levels in the same or different job families, and so that individuals new to us are attracted by the potential journeys we can take them on. This will broaden our appeal in the diverse marketplace where we know many people are seeking not a ‘job for life’ but a ‘career’ moving through different levels of responsibility and accountability in a way that suits their aspirations. For example, we are establishing a gardener apprenticeship scheme, and the operational re-focus on visitor service/experience (with clarified roles at various levels) will be, for the first time in the Trust, identifying a clear career path in this discipline.  We continue to operate our ‘family-friendly’ policies to support individuals who wish to blend family or caring responsibilities with work. Our Flexible Working policy makes sure that decisions about the granting of different ways of working (e.g. compressed hours, moving to part-time) are based on business needs and not on factors such as gender (or other protected characteristics). The uptake of Flexible Working will be monitored and specifically analysed against gender and pay to measure impact.  We are introducing an alternative pay model (to that in force at the time of the data collection for this report) which will give more clarity about how jobs are ‘sized’ for pay, and also more flexibility for managers to recruit against market conditions and progress pay on the delivery of objectives and corporate behaviours. To ensure that gender inequality does not become a factor for this new pay model, a robust governance structure will be enacted which includes monitoring of pay on entry and pay progression against gender, and senior sign-off for non-standard rates or mounts.  The Trust takes very seriously its equality and diversity, and is always developing new ways to encourage people to be part of our workforce – whether as an employee or a volunteer. We want people to recognise us a great place to work – irrespective of gender (or any other protected characteristic) – but we know that there are some issues we need to address, and that these may take some time. The Trust has embarked on a transformational journey to make sure that we can continue to be a leader in conservation and heritage, and ‘doing the right thing’ for our workforce is very high on our agenda.
