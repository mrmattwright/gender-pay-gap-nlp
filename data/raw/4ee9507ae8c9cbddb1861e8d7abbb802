Welcome to our first  
UK Gender Pay Gap Report

MESSAGE FROM DAVID WARREN,  
OUR INTERIM CEO AND GROUP CFO
At London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), our vision is to 
be the most trusted global markets expert. Our values of 
Integrity, Partnership, Innovation and Excellence are an 
integral part of this ambition and drive the way we 
behave as individuals and as a global company. 

We are committed to improving diversity and inclusion, 
not only within the Group, but across the financial 
services industry and in the communities in which we 
operate globally. We firmly believe that diversity is a  
key driver of innovation, as well as individual and Group 
development, and we welcome the UK Government’s 
commitment to gender equality and the new UK  
reporting requirement.

The Executive Committee and I, as Interim CEO and 
Group CFO, are in agreement that while progress has been 
made, our gender pay figures need improvement and we 
are committed as a team to focus on diversity as a 
strategic objective. While we are pleased with the steps 
taken so far to focus on these issues, we acknowledge 
that there is still more work to be done to achieve the 
results we would like to see. We are determined to 
improve representation at senior, middle and junior roles 
through attracting and recruiting diverse high calibre 
employees; providing support and opportunities to 
promote an inclusive environment and enable all 
colleagues to achieve their potential.

WHY DOES OUR PAY GAP EXIST? 
While we do not differentiate pay between men and women for equivalent roles, there is an 
under-representation of women in senior roles, as shown by the data in our report. This under-
representation directly impacts the headline gender pay figures, particularly in the upper quartiles  
as outlined opposite, whereas in the lower and middle quartiles the pay gaps are significantly less,  
and in some cases negative.

Our mean pay gaps are higher than our median pay gaps because of the distorting impact of the  
very highest earners, the majority of whom are male. The pay of these individuals skews the  
overall ‘average’ figures and because bonuses at LSEG tend to increase with seniority, the impact  
is compounded.

Our figures shown on this page include awards paid out under our Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”),  
a three-year scheme designed to align the interests of senior business leaders to the long-term 
performance of the Group. Our figures reported here include 2013 LTIP awards that were paid out 
during this April 2016 to April 2017 reporting period which, due to an extremely strong corporate 
performance and the doubling of our share price over the period, paid out well. As most of the 
recipients were senior male business leaders, this significantly exacerbates the pay gap.

We are increasing our representation of females at business leadership levels through a number of 
initiatives as detailed on pages 3 and 4 and expect to see an improvement in our figures in the 
coming years. With an increased number of senior females, there will be a knock-on effect for bonus 
and LTIP awards. However, it will take time to see improvements, especially in respect of LTIPs, where 
the impact will take a minimum of three years to materialise.

How we are addressing the  
Gender Pay Gap

LSEG’S COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY
In 2016, LSEG’s Executive Committee formed the 
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Committee. The D&I 
Committee is chaired by our Group Chief Risk Officer and 
comprised of Divisional Business Heads to enhance our 
focus on diversity and inclusion and its impact on Group 
performance. Gender is one key area of focus of our 
diversity programme. The D&I Committee oversees our 
investment in developing diversity in the Group 
including, importantly, our female talent and succession 
pipeline. These initiatives have the support and focus of 
colleagues throughout the Group.

HM TREASURY’S WOMEN IN FINANCE CHARTER
As part of our commitment to diversity, LSEG was amongst 
the 72 initial signatories of HM Treasury’s Women in 
Finance Charter, setting a stretch goal as a Group to 
increase female representation for senior management and 
for our overall population from 30% to 40% globally by the 
end of 2020. Since our commitment to the HMT Women in 
Finance Charter in 2016, our female representation both 
overall and at senior management level has increased from 
30% to 33%. We are working hard to achieve our 40% goal 
by 2020 and are also confident that our initiatives will 
enable us to drive real change within our organisation.

Our goal
To increase our female representation 
both overall and at senior 
management level from 30% to:

PROVIDING THOUGHT LEADERSHIP  
IN THE INDUSTRY:
In February 2018, we launched the FTSE Women  
on Boards Leadership Index Series, which increases 
exposure to companies based on the strength of their 
gender diversity at the board level in addition to how 
well they manage their wider social impact.

“This is another 
demonstration of our 
commitment to promote 
strong stewardship 
practices and market 
standards.” 
 
Mark Makepeace  
CEO of FTSE Russell

How we are addressing the  
Gender Pay Gap continued

1. Attract
Attracting female talent to LSEG  
by promoting our strong culture  
and career opportunities
We partner with specialist agencies to target females 
seeking flexible working, internships and returning mothers. 
In addition, our Women’s Network (WIN) leads a career 
outreach programme for female school and college students.
50% of our September 2018 graduate intake is female.

2. Recruit
Introducing an equal opportunity  
and selection process
Over 50 companies in the UK attended our 2017 partner 
recruiter event, designed to maximise our candidate pool, 
increase the number of females being hired and aligning the 
work of all our external partners.

In 2017, we included at least one female in the selection 
process for all senior manager and graduate placements and 
we are aiming to achieve this for all positions recruited 
across the Group in 2018.

At LSEG, we believe that 
diverse teams create 
opportunity, mitigate risk 
and are a catalyst for new 
ideas. 

As such, we strive to be an employer  
of choice for the diverse talent that we 
work to recruit, develop, mobilise and 
retain in a highly competitive market. 
We strive to understand the root cause 
of the gender imbalance and recognise 
there are multiple factors to address. 
The D&I Committee oversees our 
investment in developing our female 
talent and succession pipeline and 
these initiatives have the support and 
focus of colleagues throughout the 
Group. Some key examples of our 
initiatives are shown opposite:

4. Retain
Encouraging long-term commitment  
to LSEG at all stages of our employees’ 
careers
We are a corporate member of ‘Citiparents’, providing all 
colleagues free access to their career, family and wellbeing 
resources and events.

We are also conducting a phased culture change programme 
to promote flexible working across LSEG

3. Develop
Developing and encouraging women  
to achieve their potential
We provide a comprehensive range of insight, awareness  
and education programmes to promote an inclusive 
environment. For example, 60% of participants on our  
‘Early Career’ development programme are female. 

We also provide access to role-models, career support  
and progression opportunities across LSEG. In 2017,  
over 500 colleagues in five countries were involved  
in a WIN-sponsored mentoring scheme to aid the  
career progression of our female talent. 

DRIVING CHANGE WITHIN LSEG
We recognise that to enable and reinforce real change 
both within our organisation and the industry as a whole, 
a cultural shift is essential. To drive this within LSEG, we 
have introduced global mandatory training designed to 
reduce unintended discrimination and increase inclusion 
at all levels. For example, ‘Unconscious Bias’ awareness 
workshops have been completed across the Group and we 
are conducting a phased launch of a culture change 
programme to promote flexible working across LSEG.

‘Open Mindset’ training was attended by 100% of  
our Executive Committee and managers reviewing pay 
decisions in 2017 to reinforce understanding and drive 
cultural and behaviour change from the top of  
the organisation.

In 2018, we are launching Futures, a career framework 
and core capability model to provide a transparency of 
next steps and career conversation skills for all line 
managers. We are also initiating a female progression 
programme which will not only aid career development, 
but also address any unintended barriers to 
advancement and promotion.

female talent at LSEG

We are proud of all of the talented women 
working at LSEG, working to support our 
strategic ambitions and in doing so, 
gaining industry recognition for their 
achievements and serving as role models 
to colleagues at LSEG and across the City. 
Recent award recognition includes:

Diane Côté, Group Chief Risk Officer, named as one  
of Financial News’ ‘100 Most Influential Women in 
Finance’ in 2017 for the fourth consecutive year.

Anoushka Babbar, Head of Regulatory Strategy, 
Information Services Division, won the ‘Young 
Achiever’ award at the Asian Women of Achievement 
Awards in May 2017.

Maryse Gordon, Senior Business Development 
Manager for UnaVista and Vice Chair of WIN in New 
York, selected for the ‘Rising Star’ award at the 2017 
Women in Finance Awards.

Elizabeth Neal
Head of Legal, London Stock Exchange plc

Ayuna Nechaeva, Head of Russia, CIS and Mongolia, 
Primary Markets, listed as one of Management 
Today’s ‘35 Women Under 35’ in July 2017.

Vidumini Ranasinghe, Head of Strategic Account 
Management for MilleniumIT, named ‘Business and IT 
Leader of the Year’ at Sri Lanka’s inaugural 2017 
Women in IT Awards.

“Liz is an outstanding example 
of a leader who works flexibly 
while providing high quality 
commercial advice and a 
seamless service to her 
clients.” 
 
Catherine Johnson 
Group General Counsel

Case Study:
Flexible working at LSEG

Liz Neal has been named in the 2018 Timewise  
Power 50 awards, a roll-call of the UK’s top flexible  
and part-time workers.

Liz, who is included in the ‘Power Part Timers’ category, 
joined LSEG in 2005. She switched to a four-day working 
week after a period of maternity leave, and achieved 
promotion to her current role on that basis. This has  
helped her play a major role in promoting a wider choice  
of working patterns across LSEG – in fact a number of 
other members of the legal team are now also working 
part-time or flexibly.

Liz commented: “I’m honoured to have been included  
in the Timewise 2018 Power 50 awards. Working 
part-time has made it possible for me to balance a busy 
and challenging Group role with the other important 
commitments in my life, whilst still enabling me to 
progress in my career. I am pleased to be a real example  
of LSEG’s commitment to initiatives like these which 
promote and support our diverse workforce.”
