GENDER PAY 
GAP REPORT 
2017

Published March 2018

INTRODUCTION

Pembroke aspires to be an inclusive community, and seeks to recruit and 
retain the brightest academic minds, as well as professional and support 
staff  who  are  encouraged  in  their  personal  development  and  treated 
fairly. The Governing Body has set out an Equality Policy for the College, 
and requires equitable treatment of all staff regardless of their gender or 
other protected characteristics.  

Today Pembroke publishes its gender pay gap statistics for the first time, 
in  line  with  the  requirements  of  The  Equality  Act  2010,  and  I  confirm 
that these are accurate. This report also includes some analysis of the 
statistics, and information about how the College is working to address 
the gap which currently exists.

GENDER PAY GAP REPORTING

The Equality Act 2010 requires all 
organisations of 250 or more employees to 
report on their gender pay gap, as well as 
the proportion of the workforce who are 
male and female in each pay quartile. There 
is also a requirement to report on relative 
sizes of bonus payments, but as Pembroke 
does not pay bonuses there is no data 
included here on the latter point.

The statistics in this report are calculated 
using a snapshot of data taken on 5th April 
2017. On that date Pembroke had 335 
employees, of whom 173 were male 
(52%) and 162 female (48%). 

To take into account variations in working 
times the statistics presented are based 
on each employee’s calculated hourly rate 
of pay. Both mean and median gaps have 
been calculated: the mean gap compares 
the mean average hourly rate paid to men 
and to women, and the median takes the 
middle pay rate in the male distribution and 
compares to the middle rate in the female 
distribution. Both mean and median pay 
gaps are then expressed as a percentage of 
the male mean and median hourly pay rates 
respectively.

STATISTICS
Pembroke’s gender pay gap 
on 5th April 2017 was:

MEAN
24.1%

MEDIAN
20.9%

The actual numbers of male and female 
employees in each of the quartiles of hourly 
pay rates was as follows:

Since 2015 six new Tutorial Fellows have 
been appointed, and in four cases the first 
choice candidate was female.  In 2018 
two male College Officers retire (Bursar 
and Development Director) and their 
replacements are one male and one female. 
This means that for the first time ever, 
three of five of the permanent College 
Officer postholders will be female. 

We continue to encourage personal 
development and aspirations across our 
workforce and we have invested significantly 
in management training for members of 
our team.  In particular, we have worked 
hard to identify the next generation of 
potential managers and five individuals 
have successfully completed Institute of 
Leadership and Management training - 
four of whom are female.  Ensuring that 
we retain talent and that we support 
flexible working patterns are key planks 
of our strategy to ensure a diverse and 
professional community.

ANALYSIS

The main reason for the gender pay gap 
at Pembroke is the relatively large number 
of female support staff who are paid in 
the lower quartile of hourly pay rates, and 
the relatively large number of male senior 
academics and officers who are paid in the 
upper quartile of hourly pay rates.  

Pembroke College recruits openly and 
ensures that all applicants are considered 
fairly, regardless of their gender (or other 
protected characteristics).  Staff who are 
involved in recruitment will normally be 
expected to undergo unconscious bias 
training.  The Academic Director, who is 
female, sits on all academic appointment 
panels, has taken part in extensive 
recruitment and unconscious bias training 
and is a member of the Chartered Institute 
of Personnel and Development.

While Pembroke’s Governing Body is 74% 
male, the College currently has a female 
Master and a female Academic Director.  

NEXT STEPS

Pembroke’s Governing Body will review the 
detail behind these statistics during Trinity 
(summer) Term 2018 to determine what 
additional measures will be put in place to 
support a reduction in the College’s overall 
gender pay gap.  Statistics will be calculated 
annually, in line with the requirements of 
The Equality Act 2010 and the College 
would like to see a narrowing at the time of 
the 2018 snapshot and report.
