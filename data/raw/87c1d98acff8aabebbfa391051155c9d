RPC GROUP GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

01    INTRODUCTION

‘‘

We are pleased to publish our gender pay gap report for April 2017. The UK 
government introduced legislation this year which requires all companies with  
250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap. The regulations provide  
an opportunity to communicate our commitments and the initiatives we are  
taking to increase female representation throughout the organisation.

As a business we aim to promote diversity. Our culture and our everyday  
operations are gender neutral, however, the industry which we are within is largely 
male dominated and females are underrepresented, especially in engineering roles.  
As an organisation, we aim to make RPC* a more diverse and inclusive place to work.  
I can confirm that the results set out below are accurate.

02    WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?

The gender pay gap is the measure of the difference between men’s and 
women’s hourly earnings in the organisation. This includes base pay, allowances 
and any other bonus and incentive pay paid in April 2017. The gender bonus pay 
gap is the difference in all incentive pay received by men and women in the  
12 months up to April 2017. This includes all bonuses and long-term incentives.

The gender pay gap in the UK should not be confused with ‘equal pay’ or  
‘pay equity’. These are legal requirements to pay men and women the same  
for performing the same work, and have been in place in the UK for over  
40 years. We believe in the principle of equal pay - RPC* is an equal 
opportunities and equal pay employer in the UK and across our global markets.

Mean and median compared

Mean

The mean is calculated by adding up the total pay of 
employees and dividing by the employees in the list.  
This calculation is completed separately for men and 
women and the totals are compared. While useful, this 
‘true average’ is easily skewed by a small number of high 
or low earners. Reporting both mean and median figures 
provides a more rounded understanding of the GPG.

Median

The median is the number which is in the middle  
of a ranking of pay from lowest to highest. This is broadly 
understood by statisticians to be the best view of  
‘typical’ pay, as extremes of low and high pay do not 
affect the median.

Gender pay gap quartile figures

Gender pay gap quartile figures calculate an organisation’s 
figures to show the proportion of male and female 
employees in four pay bands. To do this, employees are 
ranked from highest to lowest paid, then divided into  
four equal parts (‘quartiles’) to work out the percentage  
of men and women in each of the four parts.

The graphic above shows that RPC* has a predominantly male workforce 
and that the proportion of females is lower in the upper quartile than in 
the lower quartile. The composition of our workforce is the reason for our 
gender pay gap and can explain the majority of the pay difference.

04   HOW CAN WE INCREASE FEMALE REPRESENTATION?

Females only represent 21% of the overall workforce at RPC*. We need  
passionate and talented individuals with a diversity of views that drive  
our innovation. We are committed to achieving an increase in female 
representation in the following ways:

Increasing female graduate and apprentice applications

RPC* invests in staff and provides a range of appropriate training – this starts  
at the very beginning of our employee’s careers. We want to build our pipeline 
of women and this starts by increasing female representation at the Apprentice 
level by making our brand better known to female school leavers. We have had 
31 apprentices go through the academy since 2013 – only two of whom have 
been female. However, we are already improving this. In total this year, of the 
46 apprentices hired across the RPC Group*, 15% are female. This also applies 
to our graduates – we need to ensure we are attracting top female graduate 
talent by partnering with universities and colleges to create a brand and culture 
that is attractive. Launching in 2018, our International Graduate Development 
programme will look to develop an effective recruitment strategy using multiple 
sources and will aim to further build our employer brand.

Overall gender balanced recruitment

Ensuring we attract the right talent is crucial and retaining our commitment  
to gender balanced recruitment is important to us. We believe that achieving  
a stronger gender balance will bring benefits, and we continue to review how  
we can deliver stronger female representation through recruitment and 
accelerated development.

Training and development of our existing staff

We want to give our employees the right skills to progress through the 
organisation and believe that there is no perceived glass ceiling for advancement. 
Our talent development programmes are significant in making this happen. 
We are building the next generation of our leaders through five programmes 
including Silver, Gold and Platinum relating to individual level in the organisation. 
The development programmes focus on identifying high potentials and creating 
a talent pool to get people ready to attain the next level.

At RPC* we are entrepreneurial, customer focussed and fast growing, factors 
which are supported and enabled by workforce diversity. We are committed 
to delivering on the initiatives set out in this report to build our future talent 
pipeline. Please see the statutory reporting requirements below:
