Coast is committed to providing equal opportunities and diversity in 
employment.  We value the differences that a diverse workforce 
brings to our organisation.  

Coast fully supports the Government’s commitment to tackling 
gender inequality and we’ll be publishing calculations every year to 
show the pay gap between our male and female employees.  We’ll 
also be explaining the reasons for the gap and what steps we’re 
taking to reduce it. 

We are confident that there are absolutely no inconsistencies in the 
way we pay our male and female employees for the same role.  
Those on the same, similar or equivalent roles are paid equally, 
however we have identified a pay gap which is driven by the nature 
of our business. 

Coast is a brand which designs clothes for women who want to look 
beautiful, feel amazing and stand out in their own inimitable style.  

As a result, we find that that the majority of people who want to work 
for the brand are Coast customers themselves and therefore women.  
Whilst we welcome men to work for the business, we do not attract 
many applicants.  This number is further diminished by the fact that 
our Warehouse/Distribution Centre is outsourced and this is an area, 
which tends to see more men applying for roles.  

Below shows our total population divided into male and female 
employees.

In our London Head Office we see a larger representation of males 
than we do in the stores.  Head Office roles are generally higher paid 
than retail store positions and this has contributed to a gender pay 
gap in our business.  

At Coast, we have 3 core Executives of which two are male (our

The below chart shows our gender split in each quartile of earnings.  
It shows that across all levels in the company we employ a much 
higher proportion of females than males, but the males that we do 
employ tend to be in head office roles which are higher paid than 
store roles.

The disparity here, further highlights how the majority of our male 
population work within Head Office roles where the standard pay 
rates and opportunity to earn bonus is significantly higher than in 
retail roles.

When we separate the Gender Pay Gap figures by Retail and Head 
Office we see that the retail figure is far healthier than Head Office:

Whilst we are satisfied that there is an explanation for the Gender 
Pay Gap within our business, we are committed to ensuring we 
continue to offer the same opportunities for the female and male 
applicants and employees of Coast.  

Senior Manager Succession Planning

We are investing in leadership development of our Senior Manager 
teams, which are heavily female biased in order for them to provide 
succession for our executive team.

Developing our Attitudes to Flexible Working

All our employees have the opportunity to request to work flexibly 
and research shows that flexible working helps support the work / life 
balance of employees.  We already have a large number of employees 
working on flexible agreements and we will be identifying role models 
to demonstrate the value uncovered by a flexible working approach. 

Raising Awareness and Helping our Managers Learn 

We are an equal opportunities employer. We continually look for 
ways to attract men to work in our retail stores and will endeavour to 
increase our representation of men across all areas of the business.  
We will be reviewing how and where we’re advertising our vacancies 
in order to attract more male employees and we plan to conduct 
equality and unconscious bias training to our team leaders and those 
who have recruitment responsibility, especially in retail stores.

The new reporting is raising some very positive debate across our 
industry which my team and I are 100% supportive of.  We are proud 
of what we have done here at Coast and what we will continue to do 
to promote both diversity and equality in the workplace.
