With this Code of Conduct we would like to summarise the most important and imperative standards and provide the employees with a guide for orienting their actions. The most important drivers and first point of contact for all questions in connection with this Code of Conduct are our executives. We expect our executives to actively promote the principles of our mission statement and this Code of Conduct as part of their performance as a role model and communicate this to their employees and ensure they abide by it.  This Code of Conduct is part of the Ensinger risk management system and applies to all group companies and branches of the Ensinger Group. The regulations contained in this Code of Conduct do not create any rights in favour of third parties.

Particularly in the case of public officials, strict standards are to be applied. Gifts of money are prohibited in any case. Standards according to state and federal legislation must be complied with.  4. Business secrets The business secrets of partners are treated confidentially by the Ensinger Group and its employees.

Ensinger is committed to acting in a responsible and ethical manner. We have a zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking ("Modern slavery").  Modern slavery is a crime and violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slaver, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.  Ensinger's prohibition on modern slavery applies to all person's working for the Group or on its behalf in any capacity. The company will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim or indication that a supplier is engaging directly or indirectly with human trafficking or slavery.  If a supplier is found in violation of this or any other policy or principle within Ensinger's code of conduct, Ensinger will take remedial measures to address the violation.
