These were not part of a bonus scheme, but the payments fall into the ‘bonus’ category for this report. Proportion of employees receiving extra ‘bonus’ payments: 0.4% of women, 0% of men. Women’s ‘bonus’ payments were therefore greater than men’s (mean and median). Commentary Bravissimo is a company that is predominantly run by women.  95% of our employees are women, our CEO is a woman, six of our eight leadership team members are women, and the vast majority of our management roles are filled by women.  Given that we are a women- led company, the gender pay gap numbers above might seem surprising.  The reason for the large gap is that in many of our roles, employees are required to work directly with our customers, fitting them in bras and swimwear.  The law allows employers to specify gender for this type of role for reasons of privacy and decency, and because of this, these roles in Bravissimo are only done by women.  77% of our job roles fall into this category and are ‘women only’, with the other 23% able to be done by either men or women.  There are roles requiring bra fitting at all pay levels of the business, but the greatest number of these roles are at the lower pay levels.  The roles that men are eligible to do are also at all pay levels of the business, but there are fewer roles in the lower pay levels.  The significant gender pay gap in the overall results is not because we employ fewer women in management and leadership roles, it is because we don’t employ men to do bra fitting.
