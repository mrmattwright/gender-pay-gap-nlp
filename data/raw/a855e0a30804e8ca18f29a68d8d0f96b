We consult regularly as part of the development process and seek mutual benefits where this is possible. On many sites animal farming can sit side-by-side with a solar generating plant. The area enclosed by our sites also create havens for wildlife to live undisturbed, including endangered flowers and insects. Some sites are so suitable for bees that we even make our own Lightsource BP honey!            Sustainability, social responsibility and long-term business success  Lightsource BP takes its role as an industry leader very seriously. We wholly believe that sustainability and social responsibility is crucial for long-term business success. Over the last six years, we have crafted a set of guiding principles by which we conduct our developments and foster our long-term relationships with local communities and all our partners.            Environmental impact assessments  Careful consideration is given to the way in which our solar projects are constructed. Environmental impact assessments play a key part in ensuring our projects integrate harmoniously into their surroundings.            ISO 9001 Quality Management  Lightsource BP adheres to the ISO 9001 standard, which sets out the criteria for a quality management system and is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus, the motivation and implication of top management, the process approach and continual improvement.
