All employees of Police Mutual are employed by PM Central Services Plc.  The new regulations have been implemented to eliminate the gender pay gap in the UK and will help employers to identify the gaps in their organisation so they can take an appropriate action to close their gender pay gap. Approximately 9,000 UK employers across the private, public and social sectors are required to produce their own reports.  You can view our Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 by downloading it here .      What is a gender pay gap?   It’s the percentage difference between average hourly earnings of men and women.      What else is included in the report?   The report provides the results of six calculations that must be published under the regulations.  Our report also provides further information to help understand the reasons for our gaps and sets out our commitments on how we plan to address our gender pay gap.          0345 88 22 999  Click for call charges  Mon-Fri 8.30am - 5.30pm  Send us a message  Arrange a call back      More information    About us Member Eligibility Our History Police Mutual People  Corporate Governance Our purpose, vision, values How we manage the Life Fund Giving us feedback or making a complaint      You may be interested in   News & Views                         About Us  Disclaimer  Accessibility  Privacy Policy  Security  Terms Of Use  Legal  Our Responsibilities  Jobs                © Police Mutual Assurance Society Limited              www.policemutual.co.uk uses cookies to help your user experience and get the best out of the site.
