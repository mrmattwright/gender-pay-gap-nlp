The Gender Pay Gap looks at the difference in the average pay of men and women in an organisation.  This is different from Equal Pay which is where men and women are paid the same pay for the same work.       April 2017  January 2018        Average (Mean) Pay Gap between Men and Women  25%  16%    Median Pay Gap between Men and Women  17%  7.7%     At Aldwyck Housing Group, on the 5 April 2017, the average difference in pay between men and women was 25%.  This means that the average salary for men working at Aldwyck Housing Group was 25% higher than the average salary for women.  Since April 2017 Aldwyck Housing Group has been taking measures to reduce its Gender Pay Gap and has, as of January 2018, reduced the difference between the average salary for men and women to 16%.  A 9% reduction.  We now pay the UK Living Wage which has improved the salaries of our lower paid, and predominantly female employees, as well as seeking more women for senior posts.  We’ll continue to improve the diversity across all levels of the organisation and we’ll evaluate all roles across the business to make sure we are encouraging and maintaining our commitment to diversity.  Why does Aldwyck have a Gender Pay Gap?  Aldwyck operate in many different sectors and markets, and has a diverse range of employees with a host of very different skill sets and experiences.  In April 2017 we worked in Care and Support settings, with roles that are mostly lower paid and which tend to attract more women.   Since then we no longer provide care services and consequently our gender profile changed.  However, we remain a complex business delivering very different services, from Investment and Development through to Corporate Finance, and this means that we have a very broad range of roles and salaries.  Across the Group many of our senior roles are held by men.  We’re working hard to address this and to improve diversity at all levels of the organisation.  What else is Aldwyck doing?  In April 2017 Aldwyck introduced a new approach to pay and reward.  Our annual pay review no longer increases salaries by a flat percentage.  We now benchmark and review our salaries by the services they support and provide, and the level at which they operate in the organisation.  We also focus on the roles rather than the people in the role.  This has meant that in April 2018 we have been able to award many of our less senior roles with a higher salary increase than those in the top jobs.   The Executive Team will receive a 1% increase to their salary, compared to 2.5% for some of our front-line colleagues.  This year we’ll be awarding employees a corporate performance bonus based on Aldwyck’s success and adding to this next year with an individual performance award.  If Aldwyck does well then our employees do well too.  Other Gender Pay Detail  Aldwyck is required to publish our gender pay gap differences by the mean amount, the median amount, and the quartiles.  This gives a good indication of how men and women are paid throughout the Group.       Quartiles:  April 2017      Top 25% of the organisation  58% Men | 42% Women    Next 25% of the organisation  47% Men | 53% Women    Next 25% of the organisation  32% Men | 68% Women    Bottom 25% of the organisation  30% Men | 70% Women       Aldwyck also provides a bonus to those staff in Sales who deliver specific housing development projects and house sales.  As at April 2017 the average bonus pay gap between men and women was 30%.  This was because three men and ten women received a bonus (based on sales achieved by each employee) – meaning their average bonus was significantly lower while in reality the bonuses provided were broadly equal.
