Construction is a predominantly male industry, although we are seeing some young females entering the industry at apprenticeship level.  Most construction operatives are not paid by the hour, but receive a piecework payment for the value of the work they do. Some can earn the equivalent of £35 per hour, and this affects the calculation of the average hourly rate for males.  Many of our female employees work part-time, and in more clerical roles although there are a now a few women progressing into more senior, managerial roles. Gender is not a barrier to progression in Jelson, and the company is considering ways in which it can attract more females into senior roles, such as publicising of promotional opportunities for women and promoting our flexible working policy.  Bonus payments are only made to monthly paid salaried staff. All site operatives are paid weekly. Bonus payments tend to reflect the level of responsibility of the employee, and with a greater number of males in more responsible positions, the differences reported are to be expected. Again, promoting opportunities for females is under consideration.
