We see this as a positive step in highlighting the issues we, along with many others, face in promoting the great benefits and opportunities in the sector we work in, regardless of gender.  SYSTRA Ltd is committed to fair and equal treatment and reward for our employees irrespective of gender. We are confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work, but is a direct result of our current workforce, together with the skills pool and pipeline of available talent that we have to recruit from, being predominantly male, both historically and currently although we are seeing gradual changes in this regard.  SYSTRA Ltd is committed to ensuring that our recruitment and development activities focus on narrowing the current gender pay gap differential.  Pascal Mercier  Managing Director SYSTRA Ltd.    GENDER PAY GAP EXPLAINED  What is a gender pay gap?  – The gender pay gap data does not look at equality of pay for men and women doing the same work but a comparison between median hourly pay, mean hourly pay and bonuses for all men and women within an organisation.  Mean gender pay gap  – The difference between the average hourly pay rate for all men and the average hourly pay rate for all women in an organisation, shown as a percentage of the average hourly rate for men.  Median gender pay gap  – The difference between the mid-point number in the list of hourly pay rates for all men and the mid-point number in the list of hourly pay rates for all women in an organisation, shown as a percentage of the mid-point number from the list of hourly rates for men.  Mean bonus gap  – The difference between the average amount of bonus paid to all men and the average amount of bonus paid to all women, shown as a percentage of the average bonus paid to all men.  Median bonus gap  – The difference between the mid-point number in the list of bonuses paid to all men and the mid-point number in the list of bonuses paid to all women, shown as a percentage of the mid-point number in the list of bonuses paid to all men.  Quartile pay distribution  – The proportion of men and women in each 25% quartile of an employer’s pay structure. The hourly pay rates for men and women are ordered from lowest to highest and divided into four equal sections with the number of men and women in each quartile being calculated as a percentage of the total employees within the quartile.  OUR PAY GAP DATA  Our data is published in line with the Gender Pay Gap regulations introduced in 2017 and is based on a snapshot date of 5 April 2017.        Median  Mean    gender pay gap  8%  23%    gender bonus pay gap  53%  51%          proportion of women & men receiving a bonus payment  50% Female  51% Male     Proportion of women and men in each pay quartile, ordered from lowest to highest pay:     upper quartile  15% female  85% male    upper middle quartile  31% female  69% male    lower middle quartile  39% female  61% male    lower quartile  44% female  56% male     WHAT DO WE THINK IS THE MAIN CAUSE FOR THE GENDER PAY GAP IN SYSTRA?  We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. We have a salary structure which we apply and regularly review all of our roles and the salaries we pay against.  However, the Engineering and Transport Planning sectors face a significant shared challenge to inspire more females to enter into the sector and to encourage them to develop careers in technical and engineering roles, which tend to be more highly paid.  SYSTRA Ltd believe that we are already making good progress in this area and this is reflected in our split of males to females in each quartile as the gap is slowly closing. We need to encourage a more diverse workforce before people make their career decisions and then we can focus on providing development and career progression suitable for all, which we are already doing.  Whilst we currently have more males than females across the organisation this reflects the historical balance of those entering relevant professions, and therefore particularly impacts the more senior, highly paid roles. However, we are aware of this and extremely committed to changing this trend.  We still receive a very low proportion of female job applicants (17%) compared to male applicants and whilst we recognise there is a problem not only within the industry but within SYSTRA Ltd we also know the benefits that can be achieved through an equal diverse workforce at all levels across the organisation. We will therefore continue to aim for this, however difficult the challenge!  TAKING ACTION TO CLOSE THE GAP  We remain committed to doing what we can so that the industry and SYSTRA Ltd can achieve all the benefits that we know exist from having a diverse workforce. To try and achieve this and to promote SYSTRA as a place where women can continue to come to succeed and to close our gender pay gap we plan to:   Roll out a development programme to support career progression across senior management and technical roles, taking into account the needs of women and other under-represented groups at all levels.  Continue to attract and hire more women into our business through inclusive bias-free recruitment practices.  Continue to provide Equality and Diversity training to all members of staff and promote the importance of this to SYSTRA Ltd.  Continue to review our flexible and agile working practise, to best support the effective management of work and non-work life to the benefit of both the business and our people.  Promote the benefits and opportunities of careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Encourage more of our employees to become STEM ambassadors and join us in the challenge to close the gender pay gap that exists within our industry.
