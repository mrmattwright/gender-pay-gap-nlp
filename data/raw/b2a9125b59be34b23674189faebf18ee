MIDKENT COLLEGE GENDER
PAY REPORT
In line with new government regulations 
MidKent College has published its gender 
pay gap data.

For the figures as at 5th April 2017 
MidKent College reports a Mean gender 
pay gap of -14.01% and a Median gender 
pay gap of -20.83%, based upon the 
reporting principles as set out in the UK 
Government’s methodology.

In analysing this information, MidKent 
College has found that it is driven by the 
following factors:

From a total workforce of 699, over half 
are Support Staff (including managers) 
(69.5%) compared to 30.5% Lecturers. 
The majority of Support Staff are women 
(69%) and there is an exact 50/ 50 
percentage gender split for Lecturers. 
Therefore, the combined pay gap figures 
could be viewed as misleading as they 
combine the very different Lecturer’s 
single pay spine and the multiple grades 
used for Support Staff and gender 
compositions for each separate group. If 
looking at Lecturers, the mean pay gap is 
only -1.14%. For Support Staff, the mean 
pay gap is -14.10%.

Similarly when assessing Median Pay 
for MidKent College, for Lecturers there 
is 0% difference between the Median 
hourly rates for men and women with an 
hourly rate of £18.46 for both genders. For 
Support Staff the Median pay differential 
drops to -12.82%. Median Hourly rate for 
Men £11.78 and for women £10.27.

50% of all Lecturers are male with an 
average hourly rate of £17.60, in contrast, 
69% of all Support Staff are females 
employed predominantly on Support Staff 
Grades A to C which gives us an average 
hourly rate of £12.12.

This replaced previous multiple pay scales 
for lecturing staff. For Support Staff, our 
Equal Pay Audits, starting with the first 
audit in 2016, have highlighted that we 
need to continue to review the multiple 
pay grades, both in terms of their length 
and the number of grades used across the 
College to ensure that they are both fit for 
purpose and support equal pay in terms 
of gender, disability and ethnicity. We also 
need to implement appointment and 
salary criteria progression to aid consistent 
decision making across the College.

Bonus Pay
MidKent College did not make any bonus 
payments to any staff employed on the 
5th April 2017 in the preceding 12 months.

Pay Quartiles – Gender breakdown
As part of the gender pay report 
organisations are required to report 
the gender breakdown for all four pay 
“Quartiles”. These quartiles are created 
by listing the hourly pay for all staff from 
lowest to highest and then dividing the 
list into four equal parts.

The MidKent College HR team will remain 
focused on reducing the pay gap across 
all areas of diversity. In particular, we will 
continue to maximise opportunities for 
women in higher graded support roles, 
by reviewing our current and future 
recruitment campaigns and progression 
processes. 

In respect of hourly pay quartiles 68% of 
staff in the lower quartile are women

79% of staff in the lower middle quartile 
are women

58% of staff in the upper middle quartile 
are women

47% of staff in the upper quartile are 
women.

The College will continue its supportive 
approach to encouraging flexible and 
part time working for all staff. This is 
aligned to good employment practices as 
recommended by Advisory, Conciliation 
and Arbitration Service (ACAS) and 
the Chartered Institute of Personnel & 
Development (CIPD) In particular we 
have a good track record of female staff 
returning from maternity leave and 
accessing flexible or part time working.

MidKent College is committed to its 
policy to pay staff at least the “Living 
Wage” of £8.75 an hour as opposed to the 
“National Minimum Wage” of £7.83 (WEF 
1st April 2018). As such Support Staff pay 
scales have already been adjusted to take 
account of this and the minimum support 
staff hourly rate is £8.90 with effect from 
1st February 2018. 

MidKent College did not make any bonus 
payments in the specified 12 month 
period covered by this report.

Female Support Staff are well represented 
up to senior positions, however, there is 
a bigger concentration of women in the 
lower two pay quartiles when compared 
to the overall representation. Work 
continues to promote gender progression, 
for both Lecturers and Support Staff.

GENDER PAY 
Mean Pay
Comparison of Mean pay at the College 
shows that women are paid 14.01% less. 
Hourly rate for women £13.38
Hourly rate for men £15.56

When reviewing each job individually, 
within both Lecturers and Support Staff 
pay grading, males and females are 
paid the same pay for doing the same 
role, with any differences accounted for 
by the length of service in the role. The 
framework for Lecturers pay is formed 
of a single pay spine introduced in 2013. 

Median Pay
Comparison of Median pay at the College 
shows that women are paid 20.83% less. 
Hourly rate for women £12.01. Hourly rate 
for men £15.17
