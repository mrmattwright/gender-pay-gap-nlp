U.K. Gender Pay rePort  
ebiquity associates Ltd., for 5th april 2017

In april 2017, the Government introduced new gender pay gap transparency regulations, which are designed to encourage large 
UK employers to take informed action to close their gender pay gap where one exists. this is the first time we have published 
gender pay data under these guidelines. 

“We are committed to building a diverse company that 
reflects the clients and the industry we serve, and gives 
everyone the opportunity to fulfil their potential. We know  
that diversity – in all its dimensions – is crucial to our ability 
to attract the best talent and to grow our business.” 

 Michael Karg, Ceo 

We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing 
equivalent jobs across our UK business. However, our analysis for 
2017 shows that we did have a significant gender pay gap. 

this was primarily due to employing significantly fewer women 
in senior positions and significantly more women in our data 
processing centre in newcastle where the average salary is lower, 
reflecting both the local labour market and the nature of the work. 

our UK workforce was 47% male/53% female at the time of reporting.

We do not consider that the predominance of women in our 
data processing centre – where they are well-represented at all 
levels – is a cause for concern. But, we do recognise the need to 
address the gender imbalance among our senior client leaders 
and executive management in London.

We recognise that we have gender pay gaps, and that this 
needs to change. We are committed to ensuring that everyone at 
ebiquity has an equal opportunity to thrive. We aspire to being a 
truly diverse company not just in regard to gender.

The Gender Pay Gap

the gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay 
between all men and women in a workforce. It is different from 
equal pay, which deals with the legal requirement to pay men and 
women the same for the same work or work of the same value.

Q: What is the mean pay gap?  
a: the difference in the average hourly pay for women, compared to men, within a company. 

Q: What is the median pay gap?  
a: the median is the middle point of a group. If you separately lined up all the women in a 
company and all the men, the median pay gap is the difference between the hourly  
pay rate for the middle woman compared to that of the middle man.

Taking action

Gender pay gaps are an issue 

nationally. The office for  

National statistics reports that  

on hourly pay women earn 

The first step towards achieving that change is to further understand the underlying  
causes of the gender pay gaps that we have identified and in particular of the under-
representation of women in senior roles. We will be conducting a Diversity Audit in H1 2018 
in order to develop a detailed action plan. Both the findings and this plan will be reviewed by the Board.

on average 18.4% less

1. “Hourly Pay” includes all forms of ordinary pay and is calculated according to the definition in the Regulations.
2. “Bonus Pay” includes any variable cash compensation (bonuses, commissions, performance pay) and other incentives including shares and options.

Further analysis

ebiquity UK (overall)

We have conducted further research into specific areas of 
the business to see how they compare to our overall UK 
headline reported data. 

Within our London office, we identified:

•    a 14% gap for mean hourly pay and 8% for the median 

for our Consulting/Client Service teams;

client Leaders, consulting and  
client Services

our teams in Media, analytics and tech in London show a 
gender pay gap both within the Consulting teams and the 
more senior Client Leadership group. the gender pay gap 
in our Consulting and Client Service teams is consistent 
with the national average; we are not content with this, 
but it is within the realm of being addressable. the gap is 
more marked at the senior end, and the lower median gap 
in the Consulting and Client Service category indicates 
that the gap results from an under-representation of 
women in the top-quartile of this group, which is further 
demonstrated in the Client Leader category. our Client 
Leadership group had a gap which contributed to the 
overall Gender Pay Gap, resulting primarily from this group 
being disproportionately male (25 men and 10 women). 
It is this area – ahead of participation in the executive 
Management of the company – that requires focus.

executive Management

While our executive Management group is predominantly 
male within this group female pay rates were well-
positioned within the range of their peers. 

Data Processing

Within our data Processing group we identified a mean 
gender pay gap of -4% and a median gender pay gap at 
0%. our data processing operation, predominantly based 
in newcastle – which has a disproportionately female 
workforce – shows a negligible gender pay gap in favour 
of women as a result of a relatively even distribution of 
men and women across all four quartiles of hourly pay.
