We are unique in the range of services we offer and, as one of Worthing’s largest employers, we can offer career opportunities in a wide range of care related work. As part of our recruitment process you will be sent a link to our online personality profile site.   Working with you    Rewards and benefits  We offer all our staff competitive salaries and a minimum of 20 days annual leave per year rising to 25 days after 5 years service or immediately for more senior grades. In addition we provide a pension scheme, occupational sick pay and free employment related checks.  Career planning  During your employment with Guild Care you will be encouraged to improve your skills and experience through training and development opportunities.  We provide courses in line with ‘Skills for Care’ standards, together with Health and Safety Training (including Moving and Handling and Fire Safety), and are currently developing additional courses in Dementia Care and End of Life Care.  We work closely with Northbrook College to facilitate the provision of QCF (Quality Credit Framework) qualifications in Health and Social Care, which have now replaced NVQ qualifications in the Care Sector.  Supportive colleagues  There is a strong team spirit in Guild Care and you will be well supported by your colleagues as you face the challenges of your new role. Each service has a well developed management team that will help you to excel within your role. Our values help us all to ASPIRE and can be read in full in Vision, Mission and Values.  Listening to you  We will give you plenty of opportunities to make your voice heard within an organisation that welcomes and values comments and suggestions from its staff. Guild Care is committed to an open approach to the management of the organisation and supports this commitment through wide access to information via the in-house website and a monthly newsletter for staff, as well as direct feedback mechanisms to the Chief Executive and a Staff Forum.  Supporting you  Probation and induction  All new staff have a six month induction and probationary period. During this time you will be given plenty of opportunity to access training and information relevant to your new role. All managers work closely with new recruits to ensure that they successfully complete their probationary periods.  Supervision  New staff receive regular supervision during their probationary period and either monthly or bi-monthly supervision thereafter. Supervision at Guild Care is a dynamic two-way process based on a shared agenda.  Appraisal  You will also receive an annual appraisal which will be used to identify your personal development plans and set clear targets and goals for your work.
