We’re leaders in driving innovation and change in our industry, and that starts with employing the best people.  We do all we can to provide development opportunities, access to career paths and flexible working patterns so we continue to attract the people who will continue to make our business successful now and in the future.  Our goal is to ensure that we are not bound by the traditional constraints that prevent the people we need from joining our business. By widening access to opportunities for example, by focusing on initiatives such as strengths-based recruitment and our apprenticeship scheme, we are confident that we will attract a better balance of male and female employees throughout our business and that our gender pay gap, will reduce still further.

Gender pay gap figures are therefore reported both separately and as part of phs Group.  The reasons for our gender pay gap  We are committed to providing equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of gender, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity/paternity, sexual orientation or disability.  We have a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work. We make sure that this happens by carrying out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals, providing regular equal pay training for all managers and other staff members who are involved in pay reviews and by evaluating job roles and pay grades as necessary, to ensure a fair structure.  This helps us to be confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Our gender pay gap is explained by the different roles that women and men work in within our organisation and the different salaries that roles in these different sectors attract.  In the UK as a whole, men are more likely than women to be in senior roles (especially very senior roles at the top of organisations).  It is still also the case that women are more likely than men to have had breaks from work that have affected their career progression, for example to bring up children. They are also more likely to work part time to manage childcare, and many of the jobs that are available across the UK on a part-time basis are relatively low paid.  The UK pattern is reflected in the make-up of our own workforce but our policies, such as shared parental leave, are helping to make it easier for those who want to change their own personal circumstances to do so.  The table depicting pay quartiles by gender shows our workforce divided into four equal-sized groups based on hourly pay rates. Band D includes the lowest-paid 25% of employees (the lower quartile) and Band A covers the highest-paid 25% (the upper quartile).
