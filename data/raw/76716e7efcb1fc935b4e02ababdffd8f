We are committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. We have a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). As such, we:  carry out pay and benefits audits as required; and  evaluate job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure.  We are therefore confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work, rather the gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation. Across our sector, men are more likely to be in IT-related and senior roles, which attract higher rates of pay. Women are also more likely to work flexibly and many of the jobs that are available across the UK recognise the attraction this has to candidates and in retaining existing staff. This pattern from the UK economy is reflected in the make-up of our workforce, where most senior management roles are held by men. We have a good representation of women across the brands which can be seen above in the table depicting pay quartiles by gender. This shows that our workforce divided into four groups based on hourly pay rates, with:  Band A including the lowest-paid percentage of employees (the lower quartile) and  Band D covering the highest-paid percentage of employees (the upper quartile).  For there to be no gender pay gap, there would need to be an equal ratio of men to women in each Band. COMPARISONS How does our gender pay gap compare with that of other organisations? The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the 2016 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17%, while in the Travel agency, tour operator and other reservation service and related activities industry it is 24%.     2017 Travel Republic  2016 ONS Travel agency, tour operator and other reservation service and related activities   Mean gender pay gap  30.20%  24%   Median gender pay gap  26.94%  24.1%  *source= Sic07 Industry (4) SIC2007 Table 16.12 Gender pay gap 2016: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/annualsurveyofhoursandearningsashegenderpaygaptables WHAT ARE WE DOING MOVING FORWARD? At Travel Republic we recognise that having a balanced and diverse workforce is something we are proud to have but this can be a complex journey and is not one single process or project. We will continue to regularly undertake reviews of pay, bonus and commission policies as well as undertaking training for managers on recruitment and ensure that our advertising and attraction methods are not biased towards any gender. We are committed to doing everything that we can to reduce the gap. However, we also recognise that our scope to act is limited with individual’s career and life choices. A new Head of People and Culture role at Group level has been created and will help ensure that People and Culture remain at the forefront of employees, managers and Directors agenda. We recognise that it may take several years before we see an impact on the gap within our business but we are committed to working towards this both in our business and the wider industry. I, Andy Washington, CEO, confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
