Gender Pay Gap Report for  

 

March 2018 

 
PURPOSE OF THE REPORT 
 
The purpose of this report is to share the Trust’s Gender Pay Reporting data for the pay 
period including 31 March 2017.  

BACKGROUND/CONTEXT 
 
New regulations that took effect on 31 March 2017 (The Equality Act 2010 - Specific 
Duties and Public Authorities - Regulations 2017) require all public sector organisations in 
England employing 250 or more staff to publish gender pay gap information.  
 
The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) 
earnings of all male and all female employees. It is expressed as a percentage of earnings 
and it is a measure of disadvantage. 
 
The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay.  Equal pay is about ensuring men and 
women doing similar work or work that is different but of equal value (in terms of skills, 
responsibility, effort) are paid the same.  A gender pay gap could reflect a failure to 
provide equal pay but it usually reflects a range of factors, including a concentration of 
women in lower paid roles and women being less likely to reach senior management 
levels. 
 
Closing the gender pay gap is not just about achieving gender equality but also about 
boosting the economy given the cost of the under-utilisation of women’s skills to the UK 
economy, and the impact on productivity. The Government anticipates that reducing the 
gap at workforce level will help to narrow the gap at a national level. 
 
Additionally, nationally there is demand, by regulators and the public, for a move to greater 
pay transparency. The Government believes that increasing transparency around the 
differences in pay between men and women will make employers more accountable and 
encourage them to scrutinise their own recruitment, remuneration, reward and staff 
development practices and ensure that steps are being taken to close any gender pay 
gaps identified by the reporting process. Over time it is anticipated that reporting might be 
extended to race, disability or age. 
 
Gender pay gaps are the outcome of economic, cultural, societal and educational factors. 
Whilst also reflecting personal choice, the outcome of the choice is strongly influenced by 
matters outside individual control, and it is still the case that women’s choices are more 
constrained than those of men. The key influences, which are complex and feed into each 
other include unpaid caring responsibilities, part-time working, differences in human 
capital, occupational segregation, undervaluing of women’s work and pay discrimination.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
The Trust is required to publish six gender pay gap measures: 
 

  Mean pay gap – the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay (excluding 

overtime) of male and female employees 

  Median pay gap – the difference between the median hourly rate of pay (excluding 

overtime) of male and female employees 

  Mean bonus gap – the difference between the mean bonus paid to male and female 

employees who received a bonus in the relevant pay period 

  Median bonus gap – the difference in the median bonus pay for male and female 

employees who received a bonus 

  Bonus distribution by gender – the proportions of male and female employees who 

received bonus pay 

  Pay distribution by gender – the proportion of male and female employees in the 

lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands. 

 
The measures are calculated using a ‘snapshot date’.  For public sector organisations this 
is the pay period which includes 31 March 2017.  The figures must be calculated using the 
mechanisms set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation. The dates used for our 
data was 31 March 2017 for the pay data.  For the bonus pay data the period of 1 April 
2016 to 31 March 2017 was used.     
 
The Trust is required to publish the information within one year of the snapshot date (i.e. 
by 30 March 2018) and by the same date every subsequent year.  It must be published on 
the Trust’s website in a way that is accessible to staff and the public, and retained on this 
for a period of three years.  The report must also be uploaded to the Gov.UK website in 
the prescribed format (see Appendix 1). 
 
There is no legal requirement to publish any accompanying narrative or commentary to 
explain what the figures mean, what the Trust believes are the factors behind the gender 
pay differences and what the Trust intends to do to close the gap.  However guidance 
produced by ACAS and the Government Equalities Office emphasises the importance of 
employers producing a supporting narrative.  
 
TRUST DATA and ANALYSIS   
 
The Trust’s Gender Pay Gap Data for average hourly rates and median rates see below:

Avg. Hourly Rate 

£20.5751

Median Hourly Rate 
£14.8896 
£12.0675 
£2.8221

This shows that male staff earns on average £6.69 per hour more than female staff, and 
as a percentage male staff earn 32.51% more than female staff.  
 
The median hourly rate for male staff is £2.82 per hour higher than female staff, and that 
the median hourly rate for male staff equates to 18.95% higher than that of female staff.

The Trust’s workforce totals 6446 of which 5209 (80.8%) are female and 1237 (19.2%) are 
male. The distribution of pay by gender is broken down into quartiles as below. Quartile 1 
reflects the lower pay and quartile 4 the highest level of pay. 
 
It can be seen below that in quartiles 1, 2 and 3 of the female group the percentages are 
very similar and the 4th higher earner quartile it is lower.  However, in the male groups 
quartiles 1, 2 and 3 are lower but in the higher earner quartile 4 the male group is 
proportionately twice as large as the other groups. In short quartile 4 as a percentage of 
the whole female workforce shows 21.13% (1101) and as a percentage of the male 
workforce 41.3% (511).

This disproportionality in quartile 4 accounts for the wide gender pay gap in both average 
and median pay rates.    
 
The percentage of male and female staff who receive bonus payment, the average 
amount each group receives and the median each group receives can be seen below.

Bonus payments include things that relate to profit sharing, productivity, performance, 
incentives and commission. These are generally received in the form of cash or have a 
monetary value.  For example we have included Clinical Excellence Awards, incentives to 
cover short notice nursing shifts and incentives for covering blocks of nursing shifts (bank 
staff).          
 
It can be seen that the percentage of bonus payments is relatively proportionate between 
male and female staff.  However, the average bonus payment which male staff receive is 
much greater than the average bonus payment which female staff receive. In terms of the 
median payments these are similar with male staff having a much high median bonus pay 
opposed to female staff. 
 
On analysis of this data it would appear the major outlier is the Clinical Excellence Award 
Payment which only our Medical Consultants are eligible to apply for. If these payments

were removed from the data used then the above table would show that male staff receive 
10.86% more in bonus payments than female staff.  The median would reflect a negative 
value showing that female have a 50% greater median pay than male staff.  See below.

Clinical Excellence Award Payments are awarded to Medical Consultants.  Our Medical 
Consultants are 82.96% (185) male and 17.04% (38) female.  Those Medical Consultants 
who currently receive Clinical Excellence Award Payments is 28.64% of male staff (53) 
and 31.57% of female staff (12).  The in-depth data supports this, with the payments which 
male staff receive significantly higher than the payments which female staff are receiving.   
 

 

KEY AREAS OF FOCUS 
 
Whilst an overarching Trust position is helpful and meets our legal requirements, to be of 
real benefit it will be necessary to undertaking a much more in-depth analysis and deep 
dive into our data. 
 
It will be beneficial to expand the way we analyse the equality data we hold on our staff in 
relation to all protected groups (Equality Act 2010) and to explore if there are any other 
existing or potential inequalities which effect different equality groups.   
 
An action plan to address identified inequalities will be developed.  This action plan will 
form part of the wider Trust’s Equality and Diversity action plan and link to the Equality and 
Diversity Strategy.  
 
Progress against these actions will be monitored by the Trust’s Equality and Diversity 
Lead and progress reported to the Workforce Sustainability and Transformation 
Committee, the Quality and Safety Committee and to Trust Board annually as part of the 
agreed Equality and Diversity Strategy reporting system. In addition, each year onwards 
we will be required to publish our data on the Government website and our own website.
