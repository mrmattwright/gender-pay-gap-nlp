INTRODUCTION

Under new legislation that came into  force in April 
2017, UK employers with  more than 250 
employees are required to  publish their gender 
pay gap.

Gender split of CPM
employees:

What is the
gender pay  
gap?

The Gender Pay Gap looks at the overall  pay of 
men and women, without taking into  account 
their roles or seniority. This  means that the 
Gender Pay Gap does  not provide any insight into 
Equal Pay,  which is the requirement to pay men
and  women equally for work of equal value.

At CPM we are continually  looking at ensuring 
that all our employees are  paid fairly for the 
work that they do.

CPM is committed to  championing the 
influence of women  in leadership as we 
understand that  inclusion and diversity leads 
to greater  business success.

We are a business that encourages women 
into all roles and as this report shows, we have 
a positive female to male ratio, which is helped 
by flexible working practices including a large 
portion of part-time roles. This is rare within 
the sales industry which is predominantly male 
dominated and we are proud to have bucked 
this trend.

‘Having a diverse workforce based on opportunity and
meritocracy is something that is deeply important to
me personally but also to CPM. As someone who has
progressed through the business,
I am passionate
about creating opportunities and giving more women
the confidence to progress their careers. We are
proud to be involved in the ‘Omniwomen’ initiative
which focuses on supporting women in leadership,
amongst many
development
programmes’.

Legislative requirements

All UK companies with 250 or  more 
employees on 5 April 2017  are 
required to publish specific  gender pay 
information:
• Mean and median gender pay  gap
• Mean and median gender  

bonus gap

• Proportion of males and  
females receiving a bonus

• Proportion of males and  females 

by quartile pay band

Figures for each legal entity with  at least 
250 employees on 5 April 2017 must be
calculated  and reported separately

The mean and median gender pay  gap is 
based on hourly rates of  pay as at 5 April
2017

The mean and median gender  bonus 
gap considers bonus pay  received in the 
12 months leading  up to 5 April 2017

Pay quartiles look at the  proportion of 
men and women in  four pay bands 
when we divide  our workforce into four 
equal  parts

WHY ARE THERE  
DIFFERENCES?

The pay by quartile results overall, reflect our diverse and 
balanced mix of male and females across all levels within 
the business, and in particular a strong representation of 
women in management and senior leadership roles. 

CPM’s senior leadership team is made up of 59% women, 
with an equal split of men and women sitting on the Board, 
being led by a female Managing Director. We believe this 
demonstrates our ability to attract, develop and retain a 
healthy gender split at all levels within the business. 

We also believe in offering choice and equally 
have a significant number of part-time employees. 
These are typically female and often in more 
junior roles which explains the higher number of 
women within the lower quartile pay band. 

As at April 2017, 20% of our female senior 
leadership team, including our Managing Director, 
were on Maternity Leave therefore salaries have 
been excluded which has negatively skewed our 
overall pay gap figures when combining all 
quartiles.  

Proportion of males and females by  pay
quartile

This is the percentage of male and female  employees in 
four quartile pay bands,  (dividing our workforce into 
four equal parts).

This shows that when breaking down our workforce into pay quartiles, we have a very small gap and in 
some quartiles, the gap is negative which means favourable to women. This demonstrates our equal mix 
of women and men at most levels within the business.

Mean and median gender pay gap

The mean gender pay gap is the difference  in average
hourly rates of pay that male and  female employees 
receive. This gives an  overall indication of the gender 
pay gap by  taking all hourly rates of pay and dividing  
by the total number of people in scope.

The median gender pay gap shows the  difference in 
the midpoints of the ranges of  hourly rates of pay for 
men and women by  ordering individual rates of pay 
from lowest  to highest and comparing the middle
value.

At  CPM, our mean  gender pay gap for hourly 
pay is 13.5%  meaning that  when taking into 
account all level of employees, the hourly rate 
is 13.5% higher for men. 

The median gender pay gap for hourly  pay is 
6.9%.

Mean and median gender  
bonus gap

The mean gender bonus gap is the  difference in 
average bonus pay that male  and female 
employees receive.

The median gender bonus gap shows the  difference 
in the midpoints of the ranges of  bonus pay received 
by men and women.

The bonus pay gap has been affected by a 
predominantly male dominated senior executive 
team with global responsibilities, where bonuses 
form a significant part of  the overall 
compensation package.  

The calculation of the bonus gaps excludes anyone who 
did not receive any bonus pay in the 12 months leading 
up to the snapshot date of 5th April 2017 and does not 
take account of individual circumstances, which may 
have impacted the actual bonus payment an individual 
received (including whether an individual was working 
part-time).  We have more women working part-time.

OMNIWOMEN UK

To underscore our  
commitment to a  
gender inclusive  
environment, we  are 
part of the
omniwomen initiative.

In the UK we have supported an  Annual 
Summit since 2015, a forum  where our future 
female leaders  find inspiration and
mentorship.
Our goal with this event and its  subsequent 
follow up sessions,  known as basecamps, is to 
foster  an environment where women feel  they 
do not need to conform to  “traditional” 
leadership stereotypes  to be successful, but 
instead can  be themselves, bringing their own  
leadership skills and attributes to  our
companies.

We believe in programmes and initiatives that attract  the best 
talent and foster a culture that gives our  people the opportunity 
to succeed.

The Omnicom People Engagement  
Network (OPEN)
The umbrella group for all official  Omnicom 
ERGs and D&I activities.  It’s important to us 
that our people  encompass diverse 
backgrounds,  experiences and perspectives 
and so OPEN, and its respective groups, work  
to foster an inclusive and engaging  work 
environment as well as increase networking 
and business opportunities.  Not only is this 
the right thing to do,  but it encourages fresh 
ideas and  thoughts that stimulate creativity 
and  provide outstanding innovation.

At CPM we are proud of our Talent initiatives 
and the focus we place on investing in our 
people, based on merit and equal opportunity. 
We support this through a range of internal 
development practices and programmes, 
including our award winning management and 
leadership programmes.  
We currently promote 60% of our managers 
from within and it is our goal to increase this to 
70%. In 2017, promotions to management roles 
were made up of 64% women which reflects the 
support and opportunities we provide for all our 
employees. 
This in addition to actively supporting those 
people with different needs and preferences 
through flexible working practices and part-time 
working. 

Omniwomen
Founded 2014, is dedicated to promoting  networking 
and career opportunities for, and  developing the skills 
of, Omnicom’s future  female leaders. There are 
chapters all over  the world, including New York, China, 
the UK  and Germany, to name a few!

OPEN Pride
Founded in 2016, promotes awareness,  acceptance 
and advocacy by creating  opportunities for 
leadership, visibility,  community involvement, 
networking and  business. Through its global chapters,  
OPEN Pride works to foster an inclusive and  engaging 
work environment for Omnicom’s  LGBTQ+ 
community and its allies.

Diversity and Flexible Working 

Career Development 

Recruitment and Attraction 

As we move forward, particularly within a 
world of increasing diversity and a change 
in work expectations, we will continue to 
look at our diversity and flexible working 
practices . This extends to a review of our 
parental leave policy where we aim to 
provide men equal rights and 
opportunity, to encourage a more equal 
sharing of the responsibility for childcare. 

We will work with our female 
employees to understand the  
challenges they  face in progressing their 
careers and balancing careers and
families. Through mentoring and 
sponsorship programmes we will 
continue to encourage, develop 
confidence, and provide support and 
development for all. 

Our new Recruitment strategy is already
under-way to ensure from the start of the 
journey, we are attracting and selecting a 
diverse and high calibre of employee. 
Our new systems, processes and 
training will ensure our recruitment 
and hiring practices are free from bias.
