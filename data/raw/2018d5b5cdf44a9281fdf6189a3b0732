HEFCE: Gender pay gap 

 
Introduction 

Gender pay gap legislation introduced in April 2017 requires all employers of 250 or 
more employees to publish their gender pay gap for workers in scope as of 31 March 
2017.  

A range of factors can affect the pay gap, including the proportion of men and 
women in roles at different levels of seniority.  

HEFCE is committed to the fair treatment and reward of all our staff, irrespective of 
gender. 

A summary of our gender pay gap data is at Annex A.  

HEFCE’s gender make-up  

HEFCE has a predominantly female workforce. As of 31 March 2017, of our 353 
members of staff, just over two-thirds (67 per cent) were female, and one-third (33 
per cent) male. 

HEFCE’s gender pay gap 

Our pay gap is in large part a consequence of a higher proportion of women 
occupying roles in lower quartile pay bands. Over half of our female staff (54.6 per 
cent) are in the bottom two pay quartiles, as compared with 40 per cent of males.  

A higher proportion of men are located in the top pay quartile: 35.7 per cent of male 
colleagues, as compared with 19.7 per cent of female colleagues. 

In terms of absolute numbers, we have more women (47) than men (41) in the top 
pay quartile. There is an equal distribution of men and women on the HEFCE 
Executive, including a female Chief Executive. 

We considered whether any gender pay imbalance might be attributable to 
differences in relation to starting pay, but found that this is not the case. Between 
2015 and 2017 a similar percentage of men and women (59 per cent and 55 per cent 
respectively) were appointed at the minimum of the relevant pay band.  

Female colleagues earn a higher median hourly rate than male colleagues across 
half of the HEFCE’s own pay band structure. This structure is linked to our job 
evaluation system and ensures all employees doing work of the same value are 
located in the same pay band.  

Bonus pay 

HEFCE’s performance payments are dependent on individual and team performance 
level and are awarded irrespective of gender. The bonus gap figures show that there 
is no pay gap between men and women using the median measure, and a small gap 
in favour of men when using the mean calculation (2.75 per cent). A slightly higher 
proportion of women than men received a bonus in the 12 months ending 31 March 
2017.

What we are doing to eradicate our gender pay gap: 

  We have regularly reviewed our recruitment processes and methods to 

ensure best practice is followed, for example the introduction of competency-
based interviewing and extensive recruitment training for panel members. 

 
  HEFCE offers employees flexibility and flexible working across the 

organisation, with a long-standing and active work-life balance commitment. 

.  
 

In the last two years all those who took maternity leave returned to work, 
mainly on reduced hours. We also offer occupational maternity and shared 
parental pay that is above the statutory minimum. 

  
  While public sector and government pay policy has significantly limited our 

ability to improve pay and reward, all pay bands are linked to the job 
evaluation system.  

 
HEFCE will close on 31 March 2018. Its employees will transfer to two new 
organisations, the Office for Students and UK Research and Innovation, on 1 April 
2018. We recommend that both of these organisations take a snapshot of their 
gender pay gap on 1 April 2018 and assess possible actions available to them.
