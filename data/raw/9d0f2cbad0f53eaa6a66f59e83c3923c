1. Introduction

1.3  The mean and the median
These calculations make use  
of two types of averages:
n	a mean average – this involves adding up  
all of the numbers and dividing the result  
by how many numbers were in the list;

n	a median average – this involves listing all  
of the numbers in numerical order and then 
finding the middle value.  

The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration 
Service (ACAS), a Crown non-departmental 
public body of the government, has produced 
guidance on Managing Gender Pay Reporting, 
which states:

‘Using these two different types of average 
is helpful to give a more balanced overview 
of an employer’s overall gender pay gap:
n	Mean averages are useful because they 
place the same value on every number 
they use, giving a good overall indication 
of the gender pay gap, but very large  
or small pay rates or bonuses can 
“dominate” and distort the answer.  

n	Median averages are useful to indicate 
what the “typical” situation is ie, in the 
middle of an organisation and are not 
distorted by very large or small pay  
rates or bonuses.’ 

1.4  This report
The following report represents the University’s 
first publication in what will become an annual 
series of gender pay data reports, together  
with contextual information and explanation, 
and a summary of the action which is being 
taken to address the gender pay gap.

1.1  Composition of the workforce
The University of Birmingham employs 
approximately 7,500 staff, 52% of whom  
are female. Broadly, one-third of all staff are 
academics, one-third are professional services 
staff and the remaining third are professional 
services support staff. The University does  
not outsource its facilities services, such as 
cleaning, catering and security, to third parties 
and staff who are employed directly by the 
University provide all these services. University 
staff enjoy terms and conditions of employment 
considerably above the norm for the local 
economy, particularly in respect of holiday, 
pension and sick pay.

The University is representative of wider  
society in that some of its disciplines have 
tended to attract men rather than women,  
both as members of staff and as students, for 
example, in physical sciences and engineering. 
Some of these trends are beginning to change: 
students on the medical degree programme  
are now more likely to be female than male; 
eventually these doctors will build their careers 
in the NHS and in research, and will help to 
achieve a balance of men and women staff 
teaching our medical programmes.

1.2  Duty to report on gender pay
From 6 April 2017, employers in Great Britain 
with more than 250 staff are required to publish 
data relating to pay in their organisations by 
gender. They must use specified formulae 
(based on weekly working hours) to calculate 
that data and must publish the figures for all  
of their employees annually. 

Qualifying employers must publish  
the percentage difference in the:
n	mean pay of men and women; 
n	median pay of men and women; 
n	mean bonus pay of men and women; and,
n	median bonus pay of men and women.

They must also publish the proportion of men 
and women who received bonus pay and the 
proportion of men and women in each of four 
quartile pay bands. 

For public authorities, which in this instance 
includes universities, the annual snapshot date 
for the gender pay data is 31 March; therefore 
the gender pay data at 31 March 2017 must 
be published by 31 March 2018.

2. Context

The University of Birmingham is strongly 
committed to removing barriers to equality  
in the workplace. Our Equality Scheme for 
2016–2020 – ‘Advancing Equality, Valuing 
Diversity’ – sets out the ambitious actions  
we are taking to embed equality at the heart  
of our vision and mission as a modern,  
global university.

As an institution whose core aim is to  
promote the growth and spread of knowledge, 
we recognise that we have a moral and ethical 
duty to ensure all members of our institution 
progress and thrive and that a diversity of 
leadership shapes and inspires the learning 
experience of our students.
 

The Equality Scheme 2016–2020 is built 
around four objectives:

n	Inclusion: We provide an environment 
that is accessible, welcoming and safe 
n	Attainment: Everyone can flourish and 

succeed to the best of their abilities 

n	Flexibility: We support different  

ways of working and learning 

n	Embedding: The active promotion  

of equality informs our culture  
and behaviour

Equality Scheme actions in 2018 will focus  
on the implementation of positive action 
measures to accelerate the number of women 
in senior academic posts, as detailed in section 
6. Action to address the gender pay gap is  
part of a much wider programme to promote 
equality and diversity within the University, 
further information about which can be 
obtained at www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/
birmingham/about-us/equality/index.aspx

3. Equal pay

3.1  The difference between gender  
pay gap and equal pay
Whereas the gender pay gap shows the 
differences in average pay between all men  
and all women in the workforce, equal pay 
describes the pay differences between men 
and women who carry out the same or similar 
jobs or work of equal value. The existence of  
a gender pay gap is not therefore a measure  
or indication of unequal pay where men and 
women are carrying out the same or similar 
work. Typically, a gender pay gap will show  
that women are under-represented in the 
higher levels of an organisation.

3.2  How we measure equal pay 
The University grades jobs using the Hay  
job evaluation methodology to ensure equal  
pay for work of equal value. Job evaluation 
helps us to ensure that: 
n	our jobs can be benchmarked against  
jobs in other organisations to ensure  
our pay is competitive to attract and  
retain high calibre staff; 

n	we are consistent and fair in grading  

and pay of staff to support staff 
engagement; and, 

n	we comply with our legal obligations 

regarding equal pay for work of  
equal value. 

The Hay methodology is the most well-
established and widely used job evaluation 
scheme with high credibility in both the  
public and private sectors. 

Our equal pay data show that we are broadly 
meeting our equal pay obligations.

While men and women are equally likely  
to receive bonus pay, men’s bonuses tend  
to be larger than those received by women. 
Staff up to grade 9 are eligible for one-off 
payments in multiples of £250 up to a given 
maximum. The mean bonus for men was 
£4,600 compared to £1,565 for women  
(these reflect the relatively larger Clinical 
Excellence Awards, which are paid to relatively 
few staff); the median bonus for men was 
£1,000, compared to £500 for women  
(which reflects the experience of the large 
majority of staff in receipt of bonus payments).

Total

As the tables show, female staff make up 
52.2% of the University’s overall workforce. 
Female staff make up greater proportions  
of the lower two pay quartiles but the upper 
middle quartile has an even gender balance.  
In the lowest paid quartile, female staff 
represent just over 60% of the workforce 
whereas in the highest paid quartile, this  
is completely reversed with female staff 
accounting for less than 40%. The greater 
representation of female staff in the lower  
pay quartiles and their relative under-
representation at senior levels has an impact  
on the University’s gender pay outcome. This 
feature of the composition of the University’s 
workforce generally mirrors that of other 
universities across the HE sector.

The bonus pay gap highlights a different  
issue. The University employs a significant 
number of consultants and academic  
General Practitioners who are eligible to  
be paid Clinical Excellence Awards on the 
basis of their performance. The NHS, rather 
than the University, award Clinical Excellence 
Awards. In accordance with guidance 
produced by the University and Colleges 
Employer’s Association, the University has 
classified Clinical Excellence Awards as  
bonus pay for the purpose of gender pay  
gap reporting. This has contributed to the  
large overall mean bonus gap of 66%. This  
is because within our clinical population 
significantly more male than female staff are 
awarded Clinical Excellence Awards, which  
are determined and funded by the NHS. 
Without clinical staff, our mean bonus gap 
reduces to 45.1%, whereas the median 
remains the same at 50%.

5. Actions to address  
the gender pay gap

5.1  Summary of actions
Under the direction of the Executive Board and 
the Deputy Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Equalities, 
we are actively committed to a programme of 
sustainable change to address any imbalance 
in our structure and accelerate the rate of 
progress in closing the gap between the 
numbers of senior female and male academic 
and Professional Services staff. This will,  
in turn, help close the expected pay gap 
between women and men. 

Actions we will take, or are taking, include: 
n	Pay monitoring – further enhancement  

of the monitoring of gender pay,  
including bonuses, through the  
salary review processes; 

n	Gender targets – the University has 

introduced targets for senior academic  
and leadership roles, with the aim of 
achieving a minimum of 30% female 
representation in these posts. Progress 
against these targets will be included  
in the annual Equality Assurance report; 

n	Professional and personal development 
– our Emerging and Senior Leadership 
training will incorporate a module on 
Leadership in a Diverse organisation,  
in order to develop diversity competence  
at senior levels. We will continue to  
deliver and monitor the impact of our  
Senior and Emerging Leaders development 
programmes and the Aurora programme  
to support the long-term, development  
and career progression of our female staff;
n	Workload recognition – we are developing 

our mechanisms for recording academic 
workload to help us to continue to ensure 
equality, including for part-time staff (many 
of whom are women);

n	Publication of equality information –  

we will publish a comprehensive Equality 
Information Report, which covers all 
protected characteristics. The most  
up-to-date report is available at:  
www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/
university/quality/publication-of-
Information-report-2018.pdf; and

n	Equality action plans – each of our Colleges 
will have a local action plan stating how they 
will achieve our gender equality objectives; 

n	Accountability – a yearly, publically  

n	University Leadership Forum – we are 

enlarging our leadership forum to be more 
inclusive and representative of women than 
it has been hitherto.

available audit report will be produced  
at School, College and University level  
on appointments, promotions, pay and 
proportions of staff at different grades; 

n	Consultation – our Senior Women’s 

Network will continue to be utilised as 
experts and critical friends in developing  
our positive action strategy;

n	Athena SWAN – we have implemented  
a University-wide Athena SWAN review 
process to ensure that applications are  
well thought through and include robust 
action plans to develop a gender-positive 
culture (see overleaf for a more detailed 
report of these actions). We are setting  
up a working group with colleagues at  
the University Hospital Birmingham to 
embed Athena SWAN principles and 
practices in the NHS setting via  
Birmingham Health Partners; 

n	Family-friendly policies – we are extending 

our suite of policies to support working 
parents; and we have two workplace 
nurseries, which have been evaluated  
as excellent by OFSTED;

gender pay gap (continued)

5.2  Wider initiatives to promote  
gender equality

These initiatives are having an impact:
n	Since committing to the principles of 

Athena SWAN, our numbers of the most 
senior female academic staff, readers and 
professors, have increased significantly, 
(female readers increasing from 24% to 
34% and female professors increasing from 
18% to 25%)

n	Recruits to our Birmingham Fellows  

scheme – which aims to attract outstanding 
researchers and provides five years of 
protected research time – were 45%  
female in 2016/17, providing these  
early-career academics with an unrivalled 
start to their academic careers 

n	35% of women (and 19% of men) 

participating in our Senior Leadership 
Development Programme have 
subsequently been promoted

Within our academic Schools, 22 of the  
25 Science, Technology, Engineering, 
Mathematics and Medicine (STEM) Schools  
in the Colleges of Engineering and Physical 
Sciences, Life and Environmental Sciences  
and Medical and Dental Sciences hold Athena 
awards, in recognition of their individual work  
to create a culture of gender equality. Since  
the expansion of Athena to arts and humanities 
subjects, all Schools in our Colleges of Arts 
and Law and Social Sciences have active 
Athena SWAN teams consulting with their  
staff and students to identify and address 
barriers to equality.

5.2.1  The Making Space Project
2017 saw a new initiative with the aim of 
recognising and celebrating female success  
at the University and encouraging open 
discussion of gender issues as part of our 
institutional culture. At the heart of the project  
is a series of group portraits of female staff  
by the artist Liz Hingley, chosen to reflect the 
breadth of female contribution to the University 
and beyond. The exhibition placed images of 
inspirational women at the heart of our campus 
– the Aston Webb Building – acting as a 
counterpoint to the predominately white,  
male imagery that has historically existed in  
that public space. In addition to celebrating 
individual achievements, the project is designed 
to prompt discussion and action. One of  
the legacy projects from the exhibition is the 
development of the Senior Women’s Network.

5.2.2  Senior Women’s Network 
Following the success of the Making  
Space initiative, a Senior Women’s Network 
has been established. The aim of the network  
is to be a consultation group on issues relating 
to female progression and representation at 
senior levels in the University. The network  
will also provide opportunities for sharing  
ideas, experiences and strategies amongst 
those in leadership positions.

5.2.3  Athena SWAN Charter 
Since 2011, we have been members of  
the Athena SWAN Charter and have made  
a commitment to the principles of increasing 
the recruitment, progression and retention of 
female staff. As part of this commitment we: 
n	have compulsory training for all staff 
involved in recruitment and selection, 
including equality considerations and  
the impact of unconscious biases; 

n	actively encourage all staff to apply  

for senior roles, with promotions  
workshops held bi-annually in all  
five of our academic Colleges; 

n	run Emerging and Senior Leadership 

Development Programmes, with female  
staff accounting for 45.5% of attendees  
in 2014–2017; and 

n	participate in the Aurora Leadership 
Programme, a national women-only 
programme aimed at developing leadership 
skills for women in lecturer and senior 
lecturer posts.

5. Actions to address the  
gender pay gap (continued)

5.2.4  Parents and carers intranet resource
We have created a Parents and Carers intranet 
site to ensure our family-facing arrangements 
are accessible and in a single place. This site 
provides information on: 
n	Becoming a parent (pregnancy,  

adoption, IVF, surrogacy, maternity);

n	Managing work and child care (return  

to work, remission of duties for academic 
staff, childcare vouchers, University 
nurseries, flexible working, parental leave, 
buying additional leave, career breaks); 

n	The University’s Parents and Carers 

Network; and 

n	Caring for dependants (flexible working, 

compassionate leave, CAB on campus, staff 
counselling service, local carers resources). 

In addition to this resource, HR continues to 
provide a dedicated face-to-face service for 
staff wishing to discuss their leave options. 

5.2.5  Guidance on IVF and surrogacy 
We are aware of the particular difficulties  
faced by staff who are considering IVF and 
have introduced five days’ paid leave for IVF 
treatment and specific guidance for staff 
becoming parents through surrogacy. 

5.2.6  Fixed Term Contracts and Maternity Leave
Where staff have contracts that expire during 
or immediately after their maternity leave, we 
have waived the requirement that they return  
to work for three months in order to qualify  
for enhanced University maternity pay. This 
requirement was having a disproportionate 
impact on early-career staff, particularly in  
the College of Medical and Dental Sciences.

6. Conclusion

Although the causes of the gender pay  
gap are complex, the primary reason that  
has been identified for us is the under-
representation of women at senior levels  
within the University. The actions set out  
in this report outline some of the measures  
we have been taking – and the effect they  
are having – and will continue to take to 
achieve a better balance of male and female 
staff in senior positions. We are committed  
to ensuring that, in future years, we are able  
to demonstrate a reduction in our gender  
pay gap.
