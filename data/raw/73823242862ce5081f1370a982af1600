With a head office in Poole, Dorset, Care South is a not-for-profit care provider with residential care homes throughout Dorset, Devon, Somerset and West Sussex, each offering high quality, innovative care that can be adapted to suit individual needs. The organisation also provides a comprehensive home Care service in Dorset, Somerset and Bath & North East Somerset, to help people maintain their independence and live in their own homes.  Care South is a caring and innovative not-for-profit care provider with a robust and financially sound operation. We are at the heart of residential and home care in local communities across the south of England and dedicated to meeting the needs of individuals.  We aim to make people feel safe and well cared for – whether it be in one of our care homes or in their own home. In many cases this means people living with dementia and other related problems associated with ageing. This is the main focus of the charity and the trustees formulate their strategy for the future to ensure that it meets the need of those who need our services either in their own homes or in residential care.
