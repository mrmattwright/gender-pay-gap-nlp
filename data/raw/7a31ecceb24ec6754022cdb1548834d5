The Local Government Transparency Code sets out the information that Councils must publish either once a year or every three months. We aim to keep information for the current year and the previous two financial years online.  Making our data available to you  We strive to be open, honest and accountable in all that we do and are trying hard to make our information available to you. Below are links to the data we are currently making public.  Expenditure over £500  Find out about what we spend on goods, services and works.
