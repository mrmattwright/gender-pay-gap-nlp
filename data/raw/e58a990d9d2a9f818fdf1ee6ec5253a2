It also shows the mean and median differences between bonuses paid to our men and woman colleagues the year ending 5th April 2017.  The gender pay gap is a difference in the average pay and bonus of all men and woman across Renault Retail Group UK, although we are confident we have equal pay for work of an equal value, we do currently have a gender pay gap when we compare the overall average pay and bonuses for woman and men.      Proportion Of Employees Receiving A Bonus            Our data reflects that our workforce is largely populated by a male workforce. The current bonus pay gap is reflective of this showing that 92% of males receive a bonus as opposed to 78% of females. This is largely related to the fact engineering and sales type roles in the motor industry are typically and traditionally attractive to males and these roles have productivity and efficiency bonuses as part of their total compensation package. We are however on the brink of launching a new bonus scheme for 2018 linked to improving our customer’s experience. The bonus will be applicable to roles that are currently occupied by our female colleagues. Once in place it will mean that 97% of our female colleagues will be receiving a bonus.        Pay Quartiles                  The above charts illustrate the gender distribution across four equally sized pay quartiles. Whilst this does show that we are largely represented by a male workforce, this data does however illustrate that our efforts to encourage female representation across our business at all levels has provided us with the benefits of a diverse workforce. We are committed to continuing with our efforts and positively enforce equality throughout Renault Retail Group.       Understanding out data  The gender pay gap is a difference in the average pay and bonus of all men and woman across Renault Retail Group UK, although we are confident we have equal pay for work of an equal value, we do have a gender pay gap when we compare the overall average pay and bonuses for woman and men. This pay gap is because of the unequal distribution of men and woman across Renault Retail Group UK and our industry in general, not because of our pay policies and practices. Our policies and practices are designed to control potential pay imbalances and ensure equal pay for equivalent jobs regardless of gender.      Our Commitment  Renault Retail Group UK has worked to address this imbalance and continues to do so. We aim to encourage equal contributions from both woman and men in all areas of our business, at all levels and in all locations. We strive to ensure equal access to recognition, rewards and opportunities. We will continue to constantly review all of our processes and practices to foster equality throughout our business and ensure gender equality in all aspects of employment.  We support the UK government initiative in gender equality and the requirement for companies to publish their pay gaps and will continue to work to close ours.

A member of the Renault family for decades, Nicole is an intelligent voice recognition service we’ve developed
                    to help ease the navigation of our website. She’s constantly learning and developing her vocabulary, but you can
                    reach parts of our website using phrases such as:    “Show me new Renault Clio offers”  “Nicole I’d like to book an MOT”  “Nicole can you show me used Renault Megane’s”       Since Nicole uses some of the latest technology available, she isn’t compatible with all current web browsers.

                    uses voice recognition, you obviously need to have a microphone attached to your device. You may also be prompted by your browser
                    for permission to use the microphone, once clicking on “Ask Nicole”.  So what are you waiting for – Nicole’s here to help, just ask…    OK, got it                       Please plug in and allow access to your microphone, then reload the page to use this feature.
