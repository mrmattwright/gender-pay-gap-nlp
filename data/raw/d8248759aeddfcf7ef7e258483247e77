        Gender Pay Gap         Tweet            Gender Pay Gap Transparency is key to the diversity and inclusion strategy at Crawford & Company ® . We openly share the government’s ambition to see balance at all levels across both Crawford ® and other companies in the financial sector.  Government legislation requires any organisation that has 250 or more employees to publish and report specific numbers about their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our Company.  The gender pay gap is different from equal pay which concerns men and women being paid the same pay for the same work or work of equal value. Crawford is confident that there are no equal pay issues amongst its UK employees.  In line with government requirements, Crawford has reported on their gender pay gap and you can review the full results here.
