The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in median pay between men and women across an organisation.   Legislative requirements All UK companies with 250 or more employees on 5 April 2017 are required to publish specific gender pay information:  Mean and median gender pay gap  Mean and median gender bonus gap  Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus  Proportion of males and females by quartile pay band   The mean and median gender pay gap is based on hourly rates of pay as at 5 April 2017. The mean and median gender bonus gap considers bonus pay received in the 12 months leading up to 5 April 2017. Pay quartiles look at the proportion of men and women in four pay bands when we divide our workforce into four equal parts.
