We’re really looking forward to supporting and caring for you as members of our own family.            Responsible pet ownership, Medivet, and you  Just like you, Medivet believes in the principle of responsible pet ownership and the benefits of preventative healthcare. This includes regular appropriate vaccinations and regular flea and worm control for dogs, cats and rabbits. Medivet recommends microchipping as the best permanent means of identification for your pet.  In order to help you budget for your pet’s routine healthcare needs, and to also make the unexpected bills more manageable, we’re pleased to offer the Medivet Healthcare Plan. Please ask your local Medivet practice for more details.  Pet health insurance  Animals can become ill or get injured without warning. Medivet strongly supports the principle of insuring your pet against unexpected problems and the bills that can go with these. Please ask for details about insurance from any member of staff at your local Medivet practice. Please be aware that, unless we specifically arrange otherwise in writing, it is your responsibility to settle your account with us and then reclaim the fees from your insurance company. Please note that the Medivet Healthcare Plan is not an insurance policy.  Fees  Medivet constantly invests in improving the standards of our facilities, equipment, and staff to benefit our patients and clients, and while the National Health Service (NHS) can rely on significant public funding, Medivet relies solely on fee income to deliver similar advanced care for our patients.  Please ensure all fees are paid at the time of treatment as this helps to keep the level of fees as low as possible for all clients.  All professional fees, pet shop and medicine charges are subject to VAT at the prevailing rate. Fee levels are determined by the time and skill level required for a case as well as medicines, materials, laboratory tests, consumables and diets used. Fee levels will also have a contribution towards general overhead costs. Itemised fees are always available for every treatment. You are liable for any fees incurred in the diagnosis and treatment of your pet even if your pet is brought to us on your behalf by an agent, for example a relative or friend.  No medicines or pet shop items can be dispensed without payment being received at the time the items are collected. This does not include items dispensed as part of the Medivet Healthcare Plan, which are subject to the terms and conditions of the plan.  The veterinary surgeons and staff will be pleased to discuss likely costs at any time – please don't hesitate to ask.  Methods of payment  Accounts are due for settlement at our discretion at the end of the consultation or treatment, the discharge of your pet, or upon collection of medicines and other pet requisites. You may settle the account using cash or a credit/debit card – we accept Maestro, Cirrus, Solo, Mastercard, Visa, Delta and American Express. We also have an agreement in place with Braemar Finance who may be able to provide you with a payment plan. In some cases, we accept relevant vouchers that are valid and in date. We usually require, at our discretion, that a deposit of 50% of the estimated costs be paid at the time of admission to our clinic for any procedures or hospitalisation.  Estimates of treatment costs  We will provide written estimates as to the probable costs of a course of treatment. Please bear in mind that any estimate given can only be approximate as it is not always possible to predict how a pet’s illness will progress, and often a pet’s illness will not follow a conventional course. We will try to contact you on the telephone numbers you have given us if we believe the treatment costs are going to exceed the estimated costs. If, however, you are not contactable, we will treat your pet as is necessary for the prevention of pain and/or suffering.  Settlement terms  Should an account not be settled within seven days, then a reminder will be sent. This will include an additional accounting fee in respect of the administrative costs incurred. Should it be necessary for further reminders to be sent, further charges will be incurred. These however, may be deducted at Medivet’s sole discretion if payment is made promptly. After due notice to you, the client, overdue accounts will be referred to our debt collection agency and further charges will be levied in respect of costs incurred in collecting the debt (these include, but are not limited to, the production of reports, correspondence, court fees, attendance at court, phone calls, home visits, etc.).  Any cheque returned by our bank as unpaid, any credit card payment not honoured, and any cash tendered that is found to be counterfeit will result in the original account being restored to the original sum, with further charges added in respect of bank charges and administration costs together with interest at base rate + 3.5% PA on the principal sum.  All missed appointments will be charged for unless reasonable notice of cancellation is given. It is at Medivet’s sole discretion not to charge for a missed appointment.  Inability to pay  If, for any reason, you are unable to settle your account as specified, we ask you to discuss the matter as soon as possible with a member of staff. Please note that instalment payments or part-payments of any account may only be sanctioned with the express permission of an authorised partner after appropriate checks have been made and you will need to sign an acknowledgement of debt. The granting of permission for instalment payments rather than full payment at the time of treatment is at Medivet’s absolute discretion.  Ownership of records  Case records including radiographs, clinical notes, laboratory records and similar documents are the property of, and will be retained by, Medivet. Part of the fees charged will be for interpretation of such radiographs or laboratory reports. A summary of the history will be passed on to another veterinary surgeon taking over the case. Should you wish to obtain a copy of the case records or radiographs, Medivet will provide these on payment of an appropriate fee.  Out-of-hours policy  Medivet reserves the right to contact other practices to provide out-of-hours emergency and night care in areas where we do not have a Medivet 24-hour practice. This may mean sharing the out of hours’ duties with other vets in the area or utilising a third party provider to provide our statutory out-of-hours’ provision. Please ask at reception for the details of the emergency and night cover specific to your clinic.  Prescription policy  Prescriptions are available from this practice. You may obtain Prescription Only Medicines, category V, (POM-Vs) from your veterinary surgeon OR ask for a prescription and obtain these medicines from another veterinary surgeon or pharmacy. Your veterinary surgeon may prescribe POM-Vs only for animals under his or her care. A prescription may not be appropriate if your animal is an in-patient or immediate treatment is necessary. You will be informed, on request, of the price of any medicine that may be prescribed for your animal. The general policy of this practice is to re-assess every three months any animal that requires repeat prescriptions, but this frequency may increase or decrease depending on individual circumstances and the opinion of the veterinary surgeon. The standard charge for a re-examination for such purposes is the prevailing price of a consultation fee. There is a charge for providing prescriptions. Please ask a member of staff for the current prescription fee.  Competition terms and conditions   Closing dates for entries are always as stated and no late entries will be considered.

Medivet Gender Pay Gap report 2017   Mean gender pay gap: 28%  Median gender pay gap: 28%  Mean bonus gender pay gap: 73%  Median bonus gender pay gap: 42%  Proportion of males receiving a bonus: 58%  Proportion of females receiving a bonus: 81%   Proportion of males and females in each quartile band:   Quartile 1: Males 6% Females 94%  Quartile 2: Males 7% Females 93%  Quartile 3: Males 15% Females 85%  Quartile 4: Males 26% Females 74%    Supporting statement:  The salaries for our receptionist, patient care assistant, student vet nurse and qualified vet nurse roles are outlined in a salary grading schedule. This schedule is gender neutral and includes a number of different factors which are dependent on; level of experience, location of the practice, size of the practice, profitability of the practice and period of continuous employment within Medivet.  Below we have detailed the mean gender pay gap of each level of role:   Receptionist: -2%  Patient Care Assistant: -5%  Student Veterinary Nurse: 4%  Qualified Veterinary Nurse: -3%  Head Veterinary Nurse: -4%  Veterinary Surgeon: 4%  Support Staff: 3%   Vet nurses have the largest gender pay gap across the business. Statistics from the last RCVS factsheet in 2015, shows that there are only 271 registered male vet nurses in the UK, compared to 12,399 registered female vet nurses. Unfortunately, this demonstrates that there is a vast shortage of male veterinary nurses within the industry.  Consequently, there are a greater number of female vet nurses over male vet nurses within Medivet. Statistically, there are a greater number of more experienced female vet nurses over experienced male vet nurses, due to the lack of male vet nurses in the industry. Therefore, there is a greater varying level of length-of-service among female vet nurses. Which in this instance, despite having gender-neutral salary grading schedules, is why the data shows a negative gap. Therefore, the overall “mean hourly pay” of female veterinary nurses is 3% higher than males.  In conclusion, after breaking down the percentage gender pay gap between each job area, it showed that there is only a marginal difference in “mean hourly pay” between males and females. However, the overall “mean gender pay gap” for Medivet is greater due to the veterinary industry being female-dominated.  Arnold Levy CEO    Complaints and standards  Medivet is committed to providing an exceptional standard of service and care in line with both our Patient Charter and our Client Charter. As an Investor in People accredited practice, Medivet provides ongoing training to its staff regarding all aspects of companion animal practice.  We realise, however, that things can sometimes go wrong and there may be occasions when you feel your expectations were not met. When this happens we want to hear about it so that we can try to put things right.    A guide to making a complaint  We take complaints about our work, staff and levels of service very seriously, but we hope that before you make a formal complaint, you will give the practice concerned a chance to resolve the issue.  Most problems can be sorted out easily and quickly, often at the time they arise and with the person concerned. Please address your complaint to the lead vet responsible for the practice concerned. If you are unsure of their name, the staff at the practice will be able to provide you with this level of detail.  Only once a genuine effort has been made to resolve the matter at practice level will the complaint be considered by one of the regional or support centre partners. Therefore, if you would like to progress your complaint further, we kindly ask you to email us at enquiries@medivet.co.uk (you can send a letter* but an email is preferred) as soon as possible, ideally within a matter of days or at most, a few weeks.  Regretfully, we are unable to investigate complaints that have been made more than six months after the event.  To help us investigate your complaint, please include the following details:   What is the nature of your complaint?  Which practice are you making the complaint about?  When did the problem occur?  Who was involved?  What would you like the outcome to be?   What will we do?  We will acknowledge your complaint within five working days, telling you who is dealing with your complaint and when you can expect to receive a reply.  In most cases, we hope to give you a full reply within 15 working days, but if it is going to take longer, we will get in touch with you to let you know what is happening. We will then be in a position to offer you an explanation, and/or the results of our investigation.  When we look into your complaint, we will:   Find out what happened and what went wrong  Make sure you receive an apology, (where appropriate)  Identify what we can do to make sure the problem does not happen again   What should you do if you are still unhappy?  We hope that if you have a problem, you will use our practice complaints procedure. We believe this will give us the best chance to put right whatever has gone wrong, and it is an opportunity for us to improve our practice. This does not affect your right to approach our governing body, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), if you are dissatisfied with the result of our investigation.    * If you prefer to send a letter, please address it to: Medivet Veterinary Group, Unit 4 Mowat Industrial Estate, Sandown Road, Watford, WD24 7UY.
