It also understands the vital role it has in ensuring that groups or individuals within the college or whose learning is facilitated by one of our sub-contractors are not subjected to intimidation or radicalisation by those wishing to unduly, or illegally, influence them.  It follows equal opportunities guidance which guarantees that there will be no discrimination against any individual or group, regardless of faith, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, political or financial status, or similar.  The College embraces the belief that at the heart of a modern multi-cultural and multi-faith community is the acceptance of key British values which it is its responsibility to promote. In doing so, our learners will be able to grow as individuals and citizens in the community in which they live.  The five British Values are:   Democracy  The rule of law  Individual liberty  Mutual respect and tolerance of those of different faiths and beliefs   The College seeks to create an environment that:   Enables students to become valuable and rounded members of society who treat others with respect and tolerance, regardless of background  Celebrates difference and promote diversity  Encourages an understanding of the difficulties other cultures face where such values are not respected.   All of our partners work under similar policies adapted for their own delivery methods. Further details can be requested from your training provider or by contacting the Head of Partnerships at Eastleigh College.
