The College’s Single Equality Scheme (SES) is intended to respond to the spirit as well as the letter of the Equality Act 2010 and the Children and Families Act 2014.  We seek to ensure the elimination of discrimination, harassment and victimisation in relation to the protected characteristics identified in the Act.  We will work to advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations throughout our organisation.   The SES also aims to promote all other forms of equality and human rights that might be relevant to our work.  Leadership and commitment at all levels of the organisation are central to the success of the scheme.  In everything we do, we will consider how we can ensure that we do not discriminate against or disadvantage individuals or groups, and we will seek opportunities to promote equality and diversity wherever we can.  We recognise that the scheme is a work in progress, to be consulted on and refined as necessary and regularly reviewed.  The practical steps to be taken are presented as an Operational Action Plan.

We have a range of equipment, software and technology to help make learning more accessible and increase independence.

The support agreed may include one of our experienced support staff working with you, in or out of the classroom.  Talking to students helps us to understand what impact your circumstances can have on your learning and to put any reasonable adjustments in place that we are able.
