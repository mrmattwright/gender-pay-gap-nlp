To transform end of life and neurological care, we want employees to be supported with development, training and e-learning, and we want to attract, develop and reward a diverse workforce.  Here, we are publishing our gender pay gap data, which we will update on an annual basis. We feel that gender pay gap reporting is already helping and will continue to help tackle inequalities in the workplace.   What is the Gender Pay Gap?   The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 require Sue Ryder to publish data about our Gender Pay Gap.  In simple terms, it is the difference in average pay between all men and women in a workforce. It is not a difference in the pay paid for men and women doing the same job. It’s a broad measure of the make-up of an organisation’s pay versus employee gender.  It is influenced mainly by:   The volume of male or female employees earning lower salaries due to the nature of the work they do.  The composition of men and women in the workforce by seniority.    Our Gender Pay Gap   Our mean gender pay gap is 1.39%.  This shows us that, on average, the hourly rate men are paid is 1.39% higher than the rate women receive.  Our median gender pay gap is –4.14%.  This shows that the median pay point is lower for men. This is the difference if we line up all salaries and take the middle point.  Our mean bonus pay gap is -14.8%. Our median bonus pay gap is 0%.   Our proportion of men receiving a bonus is 1.2% and women 0.4%. This is only 13 people in total and includes no Directors.    Our pay quartiles   Sue Ryder employs mainly women (84% women, 16% men). The main deviation from this is 22% of men in lower quartile (A) and only 13.1% and 12.9% in (B and D).    What we are doing to improve   Although our pay gap figures are low, we still strive to completely eliminate any gender bias.   Sue Ryder is in the process of appointing a Head of Diversity and Wellbeing role who will champion equality throughout the organisation.  Sue Ryder employs job evaluation, which is an analytical process of determining the relative size of jobs. We are in the process of using this to create a job grading system that will include all of our jobs across the charity. This will help us to ensure pay for jobs of equal size in different parts of the charity are paid similarly and will aid us in paying the correct salaries in line with the jobs market. Our Job Evaluation Committee is made up of employees from all job seniority levels across the organisation.  Our recruitment processes involve a check for equal opportunities. The profile of applicants is checked against who we actually hire to ensure our hiring mirrors the applicant base.  Our learning and development processes are non-gender specific and designed to ensure all individuals have access to the same learning resources. All employees regardless of their gender profile are treated equally when identifying development needs and opportunities.  Internal opportunities for career progression are determined on a fair system of advertising roles and cascading those to all staff by a variety of channels.  Our pay review processes are robust and in many cases linked to non-gender specific performance indicators such as charity shop sales, or in our clinical roles to personal skills progression. Managers are advised that their decisions must not be biased by gender or any other discriminatory factor. These measures ensure that everyone, regardless of gender, is treated equally when it comes to pay progression.  In 2016 we changed our maternity pay to better support female employees who have children. We changed from paying statutory maternity pay to providing at least half pay for the first 26 weeks of maternity leave.  We welcome flexible working arrangements for all of our employees.   Sue Ryder is committed to addressing inequality when it is identified.  This report is deemed accurate by  Heidi Travis Sue Ryder CEO    How this data was compiled  The calculations have been made using data from the April 2017 pay period only in line with the legislation. Our pay periods are monthly.  The bonus pay published is from the 12 months ending with the April 2017 pay period. We do not typically pay a performance bonus however a small number – 13 employees (not Directors) – did receive a one-off lump sum payment.  The data examines the ‘full pay’ of our employees. The calculation uses employee’s hourly pay rate, which includes all relevant payments in the pay period, including basic pay, allowances (car, location, shift premiums etc.) and holiday or sick pay, in accordance with government guidance.
