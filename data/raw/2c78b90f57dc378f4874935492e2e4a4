inclusion across the sport of cricket from those playing the game, watching, volunteering, officiating, coaching and working. Since the launch of ECB’s first Inclusion and Diversity Strategy “One Game” in 2014, cricket has made good progress in making cricket a truly diverse and inclusive sport. It continues to be a priority workstream for us, with successes including:   A full house crowd at Lord’s in 2017 to see England win the ICC Women’s World Cup Final  Partnership with Stonewall to run the Rainbow Laces Campaign in 2017  Being identified as a Disability Confident Employer  Achieving listing in the Best Companies Top-100 Non-for-Profit places to work 2017  The annual delivery of Inclusion & Diversity Training to ECB employees  Collaboration with EHRC to train 400 female and South Asian coaches in 2015/16  World Cup success for the England Men’s Physical Disability team in 2015  The creation of four Regional Disability Cricket Talent Centres in 2013   Diversity Action Plan 2018-2020  ECB is proud to make a public commitment to progressing the diversity of the game, our employees and our Board. We support and commit to the goals of Sport England & UK Sport’s Governance Code to make sport an inclusive and diverse environment where everyone can thrive and be themselves.  Our 2018-2020 Diversity Action Plan reports on the progress the ECB has made in recent years before detailing ECB’s short and long-term goals and actions in relation to increasing diversity at Board and employee level, including our commitment to ensure a minimum of 30% of each gender on the Board by 2018.  This Diversity Action Plan will be applied to all levels throughout the business and to all aspects of diversity including gender, ethnicity, sexuality and disability. This is primarily focused at employees of the ECB, who lead and support the game and therefore need to role model best practice. We are also working on initiatives to increase diversity across the game.  Read our Diversity Action Plan  Gender Pay Gap report 2017  As a national governing body and a responsible employer, we’re committed to treating all our employees fairly and equitably across the organisation. We also welcome the UK government’s efforts to address the Gender Pay Gap by encouraging public and private sector organisations to be more transparent about pay for men and women.  We want to create an environment where women can develop their careers, fulfill their potential and shape the future direction of the sport.  This is our first Gender Pay report. It shows there is a gender pay imbalance within the organisation which is slightly below the national average.  There are several key factors behind the imbalance, including a higher ratio of men to women at all levels within the organisation and the inclusion of our centrally contracted England players in the overall calculation.  We are committed to tackling this as part of our broader plans to promote diversity in all areas of our business and be an employer of choice within the sports industry.  Read our Gender Pay Gap results  The Equality Act 2010 – Guidance for cricket  We recommend all cricket organisations make themselves aware of their responsibilities relating to the Equality Act 2010.
