SECTION 4:          INFORMATION THAT WE MAY WITHHOLD  All information covered by our Guide to Information can either be accessed through our website, or will be provided promptly following our receipt of your request.  Our aim in adopting the Commissioner’s Model Publication Scheme 2014 and in maintaining this Guide to Information is to be as open as possible. You should note, however, that there may be limited circumstances where information will be withheld from one of the classes of information listed in “Section 10 – Classes of Information”. Information will only be withheld, however, where the Act (or, in the case of environmental information, the EIRs) expressly permits it.  Information may be withheld, for example, where its disclosure would breach the law of confidentiality, harm an organisation’s commercial interests, or endanger the protection of the environment.  Information may also be withheld if it is another person’s personal information, and its release would breach the data protection legislation.  Whenever information is withheld we will inform you of this, and will set out why that information cannot be released. Even where information is withheld it will, in many cases, be possible to provide copies with the withheld information edited out. If you wish to complain about any information which has been withheld from you, please refer to “Section 8 – Contact details for enquiries, feedback and complaints”.    SECTION 5:          OUR CHARGING POLICY  Unless otherwise stated in “Section 10 – Classes of Information”, all information contained within our scheme is available from us free of charge where it can be downloaded from our website or where it can be sent to you electronically by e-mail. We reserve the right to impose charges for providing information in paper copy or on computer disc. Charges will reflect the actual costs to Active Stirling of supplying the information to you, e.g. photocopying and postage, as set out below.  In the event that a charge is to be levied, you will be advised of the charge and how it has been calculated.  Information will not be provided to you until payment has been received.  There is no charge to view information on our website or at our premises.   Reproduction Charges  We may charge for providing information to you e.g. photocopying and postage, but we will charge you no more than it actually costs us to do so. We will always tell you what the cost is before providing the information to you.   Black & white & colour photocopying       Size of paper   Pence per sheet       Black & white   Colour    A4  10p  20p    A3  20p  40p       Alternative formats       Format   Charge    Computer Discs  £1.00 per CD-ROM / DVD      Postage costs  Postage costs may be recharged at the rate we paid to send the information to you.

SECTION 8:          CONTACT DETAILS FOR ENQUIRIES, FEEDBACK AND COMPLAINTS  The Act requires that we review our publication scheme from time to time. As we have adopted the Model Publication Scheme 2014, this means we will review our Guide to Information from time to time.  As a result, we welcome feedback on how we can develop our guide further.

You may, for example wish to tell us about:    other information that you would like to see included in the guide;  whether you found the guide easy to use;  whether you found the guide to information useful;  whether our staff were helpful;  other ways in which our guide to information can be improved.

These rights apply only to information requests made in writing [1] or another recordable format. If you are unhappy with our responses to your request you can ask us to review it and if you are still unhappy, you can make an appeal to the Scottish Information Commissioner.           The Commissioner’s website has a guide to this three step process, and she operates an enquiry service on Monday to Friday from 9.00am to 5.00pm.  The Commissioner’s office can be contacted as follows:   Scottish Information Commissioner Kinburn Castle Doubledykes Road St Andrews Fife KY16 9DS  Tel: 01334 464610  e-mail: enquiries@itspublicknowledge.info Website: www.itspublicknowledge.info/YourRights  All enquiries, feedback and complaints relating to this Guide to Information, or any other aspect of Freedom of Information, Data Protection and the EIRs should be directed to:   Active Stirling No 23, 15 Borrowmeadow Road, Stirling FK7 7UW  01786 273555   foi@activestirling.org.uk  www.activestirling.org.uk    SECTION 9:          HOW TO ACCESS INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE GUIDE TO INFORMATION  If the information you are seeking is not available via the Model Publication Scheme 2014 (as described in this Guide) then you may wish to request it from us.  The Act provides you with a right of access to the information we hold, subject to certain exemptions. The EIRs separately provide a right of access to the environmental information we hold, while the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides a right of access to any personal information about you that we hold.  Again, these rights are subject to certain exceptions or exemptions. Should you wish to request a copy of any information that we hold that is not available under the Model Publication Scheme 2014 (and described in this Guide), please write to:   Active Stirling No 23, 15 Borrowmeadow Road, Stirling FK7 7UW  01786 273555   foi@activestirling.org.uk  www.activestirling.org.uk   Charges for information which is not available under the scheme: The charges for information which is available under Active Stirling Guide to Information are set out under “Section 5 – Our Charging Policy”.  If you submit a request to us for information which is not available in this Guide the charges will be based on the following calculations:  General information requests:     There will be no charge for information requests which cost us £100 or less to process.  Where information costs between £100 and £600 to provide you may be asked to pay 10% of the cost.  That is, if you were to ask for information that cost us £600 to provide, you would be asked to pay £50 calculated on the basis of a waiver for the first £100 and 10% of the remaining £500.  We are not obliged to respond to requests which will cost us over £600 to process.  In calculating any fee, staff time will be calculated at actual cost per staff member hourly salary rate to a maximum of £15 per person per hour.  We do not charge for the time to determine whether we hold the information requested, nor for the time it takes to decide whether the information can be released. Charges may be made for locating, retrieving and providing information to you.  In the event that we decide to impose a charge we will issue you with notification of the charge (a fees notice) and how it has been calculated.  You will have three months from the date of issue of the fees notice in which to decide whether to pay the charge.  The information will be provided to you on payment of the charge.  If you decide not to proceed with the request there will be no charge to you.    Charges for environmental information: Environmental information is provided under the EIRs rather than the Act.  The rules for charging for environmental information are slightly different.  We do not charge for the time to determine whether we hold the environmental information requested, or deciding whether the information can be released. Charges may be made for locating, retrieving and providing information to you e.g. photocopying and postage. In the event that we decide to impose a charge we will issue you with notification of the charge and how it has been calculated. The information will be provided to you on payment of the charge. If you decide not to proceed with the request there will be no charge to you.  Charges are calculated on the basis of the actual cost to Active Stirling of providing the information. Photocopying is charged at 10p per A4 sheet for black and white copying, 20p per A4 sheet for colour copying.  Postage is charged at actual rate for Royal Mail first class.  Staff time is calculated at actual cost per staff member hourly salary rate to a maximum of £15 per person per hour.   The first £100 worth of information will be provided to you without charge.  Where information costs between £100 and £600 to provide, you will be asked to pay 10% of the cost.  That is, if you were to ask for information that cost us £600 to provide, you would be asked to pay £50, calculated on the basis of a waiver for the first £100 and 10% of the remaining £500.  Where it would cost more than £600 to provide the information to you, however, we will ask you to pay the full cost of providing the information, with no waiver for any portion of the cost.   Charge for request for your own personal data  The charge is a standard fee of £10.00 plus any reproduction and postage costs (both on the same basis as for FOI requests).    SECTION 10:                  CLASSES OF INFORMATION   The classes of information that we publish  We publish all the information that we hold within the following classes.  Once information is published under a class we will continue to make it available for the current and previous two financial years.

SECTION 12 - GENDER PAY GAP REPORT - 5 APRIL 2017   OUR 2017 GENDER PAY GAP REPORT  Active Stirling as an employer is required to publish an annual gender pay gap report.  The gender pay gap is the difference between men’s average hourly pay and women’s average hourly pay combining all salaries within the Company.  The calculation is to include contracted, casual, relief and self-employed roles which is a total of 400 team members, of which 69% are women.  Out of 161 contracted team members, 70% are women of which 45% work part time hours.    Our gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 is below:  Our mean gender pay gap is 0.82% in favour of men.   This is the difference between men’s average hourly pay and women’s average hourly pay by combining all salaries within the Company.  Our median gender pay gap is 0.21% in favour of men.  This is the difference between the middle hourly pay of all men and the middle hourly pay of all women.  We don’t have any mean and median bonus gender pay gap calculations, as this is not applicable to us.  Men and women’s salaries were listed from highest to lowest and divided into four equal parts for higher and lower salaries.  Our proportion of men and women in each pay quartile is:   % of males         % of females Upper quartile                                            30.50%                  69.50% Upper middle quartile                                33.50%                  66.50% Lower middle quartile                                29.20%                  70.80% Lower quartile                                            29.40%                  70.60%  We are pleased to report that our pay gap of 0.82% (mean average) and 0.21% (median) are negligible and we consider the figures to be very positive when compared against other organisations and the UK average of 18.1%.  Our men and women’s salaries are spread equitably over all salary levels.  We are committed to equal pay for all team members and we carry out regular pay and benefit audits and use a job evaluate system to determine pay grades for job roles to ensure a fair structure.  I confirm the data reported is accurate.
