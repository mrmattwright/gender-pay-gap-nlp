Gender Pay Gap Report 

 

1.  Introduction 

University College of Estate Management (UCEM) is the leading provider of supported 
online education for the Built Environment, with over 95 years’ experience of providing the 
highest quality learning opportunities.  At any one time, it has over 3,500 students from more 
than 100 countries benefiting from its qualifications taught by tutors with extensive industry 
experience. 

UCEM helps to enhance Built Environment professional careers through its accredited 
property-related and construction programmes, offered at Postgraduate, Undergraduate and 
Apprenticeship levels. 

In accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, 
UCEM is required to carry out gender pay gap reporting.  It is important to highlight that 
gender pay gap differs from equal pay.  Equal pay deals with the pay differences between 
men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.  Gender 
pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women.  This report 
focuses on gender pay gap only, however UCEM supports equal pay for men and women at 
work. 

Within this report we publish the six calculations required under the Regulations: 

1.  Gender pay gap as a mean average 

2.  Gender pay gap as a median average 

3.  Bonus gender pay gap as a mean average 

4.  Bonus gender pay gap as a median average 

5.  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a 

bonus payment 

6.  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest 

to highest pay.

Gender Pay Gap Report 

 

2.  Gender pay gap data 

2.1  Pay data 
We collected our data on 5 April 2017, when our workforce consisted of 150 women and 150 
men.  The figures show that UCEM has a mean gender pay gap of 16.97% and a median 
gender pay gap of 19.30%. 

Although there is an even gender split in the reporting period, there were more women 
undertaking administration roles, which typically sit within the lower quartiles.  UCEM is a 
very flexible employer and almost half of our employee group have part-time status – this is 
both men and women.  Typically, a higher proportion of part-time men work in academic 
roles, whereas many part-time women, are located within student administration and support 
roles. 

In the lower quartile, there were 53 women and 22 men.  In the lower middle quartile, 
there were 39 women and 36 men.  This means that 61% of our employee group in the 
lower quartiles, were women. 

In upper middle quartile, there were 22 women and 53 men.  All employees within this 
quartile were in an academic delivery role, where the rate of pay is consistent, however this 
is our most fluid group of employees.  Due to the nature of our academic semester structure, 
employment is on a fixed-term basis with changes to this group, every six to seven months.  
Most importantly, the number of students enrolled on our academic programmes determines 
the demand for fixed-term employees with specific subject expertise.  These factors 
combined, may result in changes to the gender split during any reporting year. 

In the upper quartile, there were 36 women and 39 men.  Most employees within this 
quartile held senior professional or senior academic roles, typically with management 
responsibility.  Our Senior Leadership Team (SLT) also fall within this quartile, which 
consisted of three women and five men, all of whom worked full-time.  We note that if the 
holder of our Principal position were female, our mean gender pay gap would fall to 13.58%.  
Similarly, if UCEM were to employ more men in the lower pay quartile while keeping 
constant the total number of employees, this would also reduce the gender pay gap. 

Summary of the key reporting data: 

 

Women’s 

earnings are: 

Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay 

16.97% lower 

Median gender pay gap in hourly pay 

19.30% lower

2.2  Bonus data 
In the reporting year 2016-17, 89 employees (29.67%) received a bonus; 50 were women 
and 39 were men.  Bonuses at UCEM are linked to job performance, some being job role 
specific. 

The difference in the mean bonus payment was 34.41% however the difference in the 
median bonus payment was -20.87%.  This means that the median bonus payment for 
women was higher than the bonus payment for men.

Women’s 

bonuses are:

3.  Closing remarks and next steps 

We are pleased that our gender pay gap stands below the mean national average but we 
recognise the need to work to close this gap.  Since the reporting period, we have 
undertaken detailed work in relation to our pay structure and job levels, as well as 
undertaken a comprehensive pay benchmarking exercise.  This work in relation to our pay 
system will continue, with the development of a formal pay policy, which we will promote 
both internally and externally.  At the next pay review round and before final pay decisions 
are made, we will further consider how we can reduce our gender pay gap, by including a 
gender analysis within the data presented to department heads. 

UCEM is committed to applying its equal opportunities policy throughout the employment 
lifecycle.  At the recruitment and selection stage, we shortlist, interview and select individuals 
against clear person specification criteria.  In the future we are keen to see what work can be 
done to encourage more men into our varied and interesting administration roles, and we will 
continue to promote our many flexible ways of working, which has appeal to both genders.

In terms of equal pay, we will aim to build an equal pay review into our planning process and 
may extend the scope of this report in the future. 

Finally, UCEM will continue to set aside funds for staff development, including providing 
equal access and opportunity for both women and men, for management and leadership 
development to enhance career prospects, in the future.
