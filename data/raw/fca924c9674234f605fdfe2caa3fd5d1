 

MERCHANT TAYLORS’ SCHOOL CROSBY  

GENDER PAY GAP REPORT - APRIL 2018 

 

 

Merchant Taylors’ Schools Crosby employs in excess of 325 employees across our four schools 
and are committed to addressing workplace barriers to equality and providing all employee’s 
with equal opportunity.  

We are required by law to report on our Gender Pay Gap, which is a regulation under The 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 which came into effect on 
the 6th April 2017.  

The gender pay gap is defined as the difference in median pay between men and women, it is 
calculated  as  the  difference  between  median  male  and  female  average  earnings  based  on 
hourly rates and is expressed as a percentage of men’s pay. The median average gender pay 
gap according to the Office of National Statistics in April 2016 was 18.2%.   

For the purposes of this report this snapshot was taken on 5 April 2017, at this point Merchant 
Taylors’  Schools  employed  109  males  and  216  females,  meaning  32%  more  females  are 
employed than males.  Both the median and mean gender pay gap based on hourly rates must 
be reported, this is detailed below. 

The  mean  gender  pay  gap  at  Merchant  Taylors’  Schools  is  14.6%  which  is  the  difference 
between  females’  mean  hourly  wage  and  males’  mean  hourly  wage  and  is  reported  as  a 
percentage of the difference. 

The median gender  pay gap at  Merchant  Taylors’  Schools  is 23.68% which is calculated by 
ranking all employees from the highest paid to the lowest paid and taking the hourly wage 
from the person in the middle. The gender pay gap is reported as the difference between the 
middle paid female and the middle paid male reported as a percentage of the difference. 

It is important to note that the gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women 
differently for the same equivalent work. Rather, the gender pay gap is the result of the roles 
in which men and women work within the Schools and the salaries these roles attract.

At  Merchant  Taylors’  Schools  all  teachers are  paid on  the  same  scale  and  all  teaching  and 
support roles are open to both male and female applicants. No employees are paid below the 
National living wage. Some part time flexible roles continue to attract a large proportion of 
female  applicants  and  Merchant  Taylors’  Schools  are  keen  to  support  our  employees  by 
offering more flexible working patterns across the schools.  

Merchant Taylors’ Schools will continue to work with its employees to promote and safeguard 
equality of opportunity across all of our schools in our desire to enhance the quality of the 
working lives of all our staff. 

The accompanying table provides the required data for gender pay gap reporting purposes.
