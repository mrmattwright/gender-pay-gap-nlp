Please find the information below. Please note, at that time, Warrington & Vale Royal College operated as two separate Colleges, Mid Cheshire College and Warrington Collegiate.  Mid Cheshire College  The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women.  On 31 March 2017, Mid Cheshire College employed 290 members of staff, comprising 91 male staff and 199 female staff. Analysis of our data shows:   Mean gender pay gap was 6.30% The mean gender pay gap is the difference in average hourly rates of pay that male and female employees receive.    Median gender pay gap was 8.90% The median gender pay gap shows the differences at the midpoints of the ranges of hourly pay rates of men and women by ordering rates from lowest to highest, and comparing the midpoint.    Quartile breakdown (the percentage of male and female employees in four quartile bands) was:   First quartile                      25% male           75% female  Second quartile                 26% male            74% female  Third quartile                     36% male            64% female  Fourth quartile                   39% male            61% female   No bonus payments were paid to staff, and therefore there are no statistics to report for mean bonus pay gap, median bonus pay gap or proportion of males/females receiving bonus payments.   The most significant challenges we face are:   A higher proportion of women in lower paid positions, e.g. administration, catering  A high proportion of female staff, and an uneven distribution of men and women throughout the quartiles.   Our most significant successes are:   The College compared very favourably to the UK pay gap of 18.4% in April 2017 (Office for National Statistics)  Women well represented in senior levels in organisation.   Our commitments for the future:   Review recruitment processes and career progression opportunities  Opportunity for all staff to attend leadership development programme  Review of flexible working  Where appropriate, encourage both men and women to consider options for shared parental leave.   Warrington Collegiate  The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women.  On 31 March 2017, Warrington Collegiate employed 397 members of staff, comprising 142 male staff and 255 female staff.

The most significant challenges we face are:   A higher proportion of women in lower paid positions, e.g. administration, catering, invigilation  A high proportion of female staff, and an uneven distribution of men and women throughout the quartiles  Under representation of female staff in Engineering and Construction Lecturing roles, where there is a market premium.
