Our services are continually developing, as we look for the most effective ways to support people out of homelessness and set them up with the skills to sustain tenancies, access training and employment and build a positive support network.    Accommodation and Support     As well as undertaking carers assessments, our Carers Centre also offers a flexible support service that provides impartial advice & information. We can also signpost carers to specialist organisations depending on individual needs and circumstances.    Carers Support     Bullybusters is a help and advice service that aims to support victims of bullying and their families.  As well as a free & confidential helpline, the service also operates a full anti bullying initiative.    Bullybusters     Domestic abuse is widespread and can affect anyone. It applies to women and men of any age, race and social class. Local Solutions operates three specialist services to support victims of domestic abuse and their families.    Domestic Abuse     Liverpool Shopmobility supports people with mobility restrictions through the loan of mobility equipment. The service provides freedom and independence to people and allows them to easily access amenities in Liverpool City Centre including shops, cafes, museums and cultural events.    Shopmobility     Our adult social care services provide a wide range of support to enable people to continue to live at home and access the community around them. Our support packages are flexible and adapted as an individual’s care needs, objectives and goals change. We can provide planned services throughout the day and night.    Adult Social Care     Local Solutions offers a Fuel Debt advice service and delivers a Macmillan Benefit Advice Service in the Royal Liverpool and Broad Green Hospitals.

She was living alone, following a divorce from her husband who had previously managed all of the finances.  The Money Advice Service helped Verity to understand the bills and avoid falling into arrears again. They helped her to arrange an affordable payment plan and assisted her with a grant application to wipe out the arrears so that she could start afresh and manage her bills within her weekly income.                Shopmobility     Scott came into Shopmobility suffering with breathing difficulties and asked about the scooters. The staff trained him to use the scooter and then he took it out. When he returned 3 hours later he was so delighted that his breathing had improved.  He said he had been able to do all his shopping, had his lunch and was able to watch the street performers in the city centre.                AIMS     Peter, 19, was referred to the AIMS project when he was given an eviction notice from a young person’s hostel. Peter suffered with poor mental health due to the loss of his mother at a young age and was using cannabis and legal highs as a coping mechanism. His AIMS mentor mediated between Peter and hostel staff to develop a behavioural contract, so that Peter did not become homeless again.
