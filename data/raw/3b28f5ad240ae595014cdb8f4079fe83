Gender pay gap
Gender Pay Gap legislation (developed by the Government Equalities Office) introduced in 
April 2017 requires all employers of 250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap 
for workers in scope as of 31 March 2017.

MMO’s pay approach supports the fair treatment and reward of all staff irrespective of 
gender.

MMO’s gender pay gap
MMO’s pay system covers Civil Service grades ranging from administrative to managerial 
level. Grades vary according to the level of responsibility that staff have. Each grade has a set 
pay range with pay gaps in between grades. 

MMO’s Senior Civil Servants are covered pay arrangements which apply across the Civil 
Service.

Comparison of mean pay in MMO shows a gap in favour of men of 16%, against an 11% gap 
across the whole Civil Service*. Comparison of median pay in MMO shows a gap in favour 
of men of 14%, while across the whole Civil Service the gap is 12.7%*.

When pay is analysed by grade, average pay gaps are smaller or non existent  than the over-
all figure: in most grades there is no gap or the gap is in favour of women.

Bonus pay 
MMO operates a reward and recognition scheme based on performance, irrespective of 
gender. There is no gap between men and women in the median bonus figure and a gap of 
16% in favour of men when using the mean calculation.

Pay by Quartiles; hourly quartile
32% of people in the lower pay quartile are women, as are 33% in the upper quartile.

Work on eradicating the gender pay gap 
MMO and the senior leadership team are committed to fair pay irrespective of gender. 

We will continue to build on actions and initiatives including:

Support for women returning to work - through 
shared parental leave, jobsharing, compressed hours, 
part-time, and term-time only opportunities. We will 
enhance our communication during period of parental 
leave to ensure all vacancies are communicated.

Helping women progress in their careers - through 
development conversations with their line managers, 
development opportunities, and talent management 
schemes such as a Positive Action Pathway programme. 
We encourage and support attendance at the Women 
in Leadership Conference.

Supporting MMO’s Women’s network actively promote 
gender equality, run upskilling events, promote cam-
paigns and hold talks to inspire and support other 
women in the department

Reviewing our recruitment processes, focusing on how 
to attract women into the Senior Civil Service, 
anonymising the application process to reduce uncon-
scious bias and ensuring all interviewers have under-
gone unconscious bias training.

Monitoring pay - to identify pay differences and take 
targeted action where appropriate, within Civil Service 
pay controls.

Ensuring that gender equality is a central point in the 
creation of our departmental Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy.
