Why our people matter to us  Our people are essential to our success and growth. We recognise that we need a skilled and committed workforce – with a diverse range of experience and perspectives.  Our approach  We work to create diverse workplaces and develop talent – while upholding the rights of our workforce and giving them simple ways to raise concerns.  Diversity  Diversity is essential to our business. We aim to employ workforces that reflect the demographics of the communities where we operate.

We prohibit all forms of discrimination, and do not tolerate any form of harassment in the workplace.         UK Gender Pay Gap disclosure      Gender Pay Gap report            In 2017, the UK government introduced legislation requiring all UK-based companies employing more than 250 relevant employees as at 5 April 2017 to report on their gender pay gap.  This statutory disclosure is for Glencore UK Ltd., which had 348 employees (232 male, 116 female).  Across the Glencore group, we recognise that it is our people who are key to our success. Glencore UK wants to attract and retain the best people and a key part of that is ensuring everyone has equal opportunities, regardless of particular characteristics such as gender, race and age.  Our analysis shows that our pay gap relates to the structure of our workforce rather than inequality of pay.  In our sector, similar to many others, there has traditionally been a greater proportion of men than women pursuing careers and, as a result, 2/3 of our employees are men. This has led to a greater number of men than women in senior and other positions that attract a higher level of pay. We maintain our position to recruit and develop our people on merit. We are committed to supporting women going on and returning from maternity leave and have policies in place to support both.  Our approach We are committed to maintain a capable and engaged workforce in order to meet our business objectives. Our approach incudes:   continuing to support the development of talented people regardless of age, gender or race through local employment;  developing and strengthening of our trainee programmes and leadership training and advancement;  taking an equal approach to family-friendly practices, including flexible working; and  becoming an employer of choice in the marketplaces where our main offices and industrial operations participate.
