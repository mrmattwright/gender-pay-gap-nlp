Dow Jones International Limited, which is the London office of Dow Jones, falls into this category. The data in this report represents less than 10% of Dow Jones’s global workforce.       Mark Musgrave, Chief People Officer, said: “At Dow Jones we are committed to providing equal opportunities for all of us to thrive, regardless of gender, race, or background, and we are taking tangible steps to build a diverse and inclusive culture across our organisation.
