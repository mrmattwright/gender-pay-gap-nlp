So you can bet that every tin is crafted with over 200 years of knowledge, experience and passion.  Our head offices are based in Darwen, Lancashire, which we’re proud to say is the same town in which we started all those years ago. Today, we also have a manufacturing site in Hull and an ever growing network of over 140 Crown Decorating Centre’s located throughout the UK and Ireland.  The history of Crown Paints is an illustrious one, with key events scattered into our 200 year history and starting with the establishment of Dob Meadows Print shop in 1777.  The mid 1800’s saw the introduction of wallpaper manufacture with the production of Lincrusta and Anaglypta, some of the best known and oldest wallpaper brands today.  The first experiments into water based paints began in 1904, with the first batch of paint being sold less than 2 years later. It was then a further 60 years until the first paint was sold under the Crown brand name.  1970 – 1980 was a period of firsts for Crown Paints, with the introduction of Crown Solo one coat paint, Non Drip Gloss and Satin ranges and Crown Paints Matchpots®, offering consumers the chance to ‘try before you buy’ for the first time.  Crown Paints proudly holds the Royal Warrant. First awarded to us in 1949 as supplier to King George VI, the warrant has since been renewed by Queen Elizabeth II.  Our professional finishes, notably Crown Trade, Sandtex Trade and Sadolin are specified for some of the most prestigious buildings in the British Isles, whilst our household names brands, such as Crown have found favour with several generations of home owners.
