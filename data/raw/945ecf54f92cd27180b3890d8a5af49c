 
OUR 2017 GENDER PAY REPORT

We welcome the UK Government’s requirement for transparency on gender pay  
and are committed to creating a fair, diverse and inclusive place for people to work. 
We offer a fair benefits and compensation package, which is available to all colleagues 
relative to their role and level in the organisation.

PAY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN  

WOMEN AND MEN

PROPORTION OF COLLEAGUES  

AWARDED A BONUS

   The mean average hourly pay of men at Breedon 
is 2.3% higher than that of women.  This reflects 
the fact that we generally have more men in 
senior, higher-paid roles or in roles which benefit 
from shift allowances and other allowances for 
on-site working. 
   The median pay of men at Breedon is 5.08% lower 
than that of women.

   All Breedon employees received a bonus in the 
12 months to 5 April 2017.  The median bonus 
value awarded across the Group was the same, 
regardless of gender. 
   The mean bonus received by men was 
significantly higher than that of females, due to 
there being more men in senior positions where 
our incentive scheme generates higher bonuses.  
We are taking steps to encourage more women 
into senior management roles  
to address this disparity.

The above charts show the gender 
distribution across Breedon in four 
equally-sized, hourly-paid quartiles, 
each containing approximately  
560 employees. 

They indicate that women are 
relatively well represented in the 

middle-upper and middle-lower 
quartiles and less well represented 
in more junior roles and in the most 
senior management positions.   
We are taking steps to increase  
the number of women in our 
business and this will help us move 
towards a more even distribution. 

I confirm that the data reported  
is accurate.
