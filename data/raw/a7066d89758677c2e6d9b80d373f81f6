The Gender Pay Gap

INTRODUCTION FROM KENNY WILSON, CEO OF CATH KIDSTON:

Ensuring equality of 
opportunity is really 
important to us at Cath 
Kidston and to me 
personally. Central to the 
brand, and everything it 
stands for, is that people 
enjoy working for Cath 
Kidston. 

Cath Kidston’s motto is to brighten 

up your day, and we really do try to live and breathe 
this every single day, whether this is for the teams in our 
stores serving our customers or the team at our Head 
Office in West London. We not only want to attract 
people to work at Cath Kidston, but we want people 
to want to stay working with us. 

People often forget it but we are still 
a relatively small company with 1,800 
employees worldwide.

The majority of our customers are female and 
the team who work at Cath Kidston are 94% 
female. 

We do have a pay gap due in part to 
the fact that the majority of our female 
workforce hold roles in our stores which are 
lower paid than head office roles and many 
of these colleagues work part time or flexible 
hours. This causes the gap to increase. 1,182 
women work in our stores versus 42 men. Of 
these 42 men, four are in store management 
roles.

Our head office team is 

87%

13%

The Operating Board, which leads Cath Kidston, is 
54%

46%

The Commercial Director, Product Director, Creative 

Director, Marketing Director, Design Director and 

E-Commerce Director  are all women and sit on the 
Operating Board. We make sure that colleagues in 
our stores have every opportunity to apply for head 
office roles and are actively encouraged to do so.

We have 
two female 

Non-Executive 
Directors on our 

Main Board. 

We know that for lots of people 
working full time, five days a week just 
does not fit their lifestyle, their other 
commitments or what they want. We 
are proud that we offer flexibility across 

our teams, offering careers with a variety of roles 
and hours. Many of our store colleagues choose to 
work part time because it better suits them. We do 
this because it is what people increasingly want but it 
means the gender gap is increased.

Over the past 12 months we have increased even 
further our commitment to promote flexibility and 
opportunity for our team at Cath Kidston. We:

Introduced paid time off for emergency 
dependent care

Introduced Summer Working Hours for office-
based colleagues
 
Offer unpaid Parental Leave of up to 18 weeks
 
Introduced the opportunity to take a career 
break after 2 years of service 
 
Are committed to paying above the National 
Living Wage and our minimum rate of pay is £7.95 
per hour
