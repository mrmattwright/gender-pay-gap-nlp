As the UK average is around 18% (according to the Office for National Statistics), Brenntag UK fall well below this at 10.9% . Our business, and overall our industry, is heavily male dominated, as we can see from our gender split, with 72% of our workforce being male. Our Gender Pay Gap is strongly influenced by the demographic of our Operations teams, with 100% of our Yard Operators and Drivers being male; this accounts for around 40% of our total workforce. The Operations positions tend to be more labour intensive which doesn’t currently attract female applicants. Ultimately, this causes a Gender Pay Gap, although in our case a relatively minor Gender Pay Gap. Going forward, we can try and encourage more women to apply for these Operations roles, although, this is an issue which is seen throughout our industry. As an equal opportunities employer, Brenntag UK Ltd, do not discriminate based on gender. We believe in appointing the best candidate for the role based on merit. We would, of course, welcome applications from any gender for any role. We are also confident that female and male colleagues are paid equally for doing the equivalent jobs throughout our business.
