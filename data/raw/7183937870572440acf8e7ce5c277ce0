Work on eradicating the Gender Pay Gap 

The Company workforce is predominantly female; even in the highest paid quartile 82.63% 
of employees are female (compared to the Council’s 60%), showing that there is strong 
career progression opportunities for women. However, the mean gender pay gap of 4.32% 
shows that further progress is needed in this.  

Measures which are being used include: 

  Support for women returning to work – through shared parental leave, job sharing, 

compressed hours, part-time, and term-time opportunities.   

  The Company has also registered interest in participating in a national Women 

Returners scheme (though early days).  

  Encouraging men to take advantage of arrangements which enable them to fulfil their 

caring responsibilities, such as shared parental leave, part time working and 
compressed hours. 

  Continuous improvements for the recruitment process: the Company has updated its 
recruitment procedures and have anonymised the application process to reduce the 
potential for unconscious bias and ensures that at least one panel member has 
undergone training.
