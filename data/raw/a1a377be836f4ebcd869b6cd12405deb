Gender Pay Gap Report 2017/18 

This  paper  provides  a  summary  of  the  findings  from  the  trust’s  first  Gender  Pay  Gap  audit  which 
fulfils  the  legal  requirement  to  report  by  30  March  2018.  The  paper  provides  some  general 
conclusions  and  a  number  of  actions  to  address  the  findings  and  improve  performance  in  this 
respect. 

2.  Background 

 

All employers in Great Britain with more than 250 staff are required by law to publish their gender 
pay  gap  information,  covering  pay  and  bonuses  by  30  March  2018  and  annually  thereafter.  In 
January 2018, standard reports were introduced as part of the NHS Workforce Profile dashboard in 
ESR Business Intelligence, designed to provide the results of the calculations detailed in the gender 
pay  gap  reporting  requirement  based  on  the  data  in  ESR.  This  is  the  mechanism  that  NHS  trusts 
are likely to be using to review and report their data. 

A  gender  pay  gap  shows  the  difference  in  the  average  pay  between  all  men  and  woman  in  a 
workforce. Used to its full potential, gender pay gap reporting is a valuable tool for assessing levels 
of  equality  in  the  workplace,  female  and  male  participation,  and  how  effectively  talent  is  being 
maximised.  If  a  workforce  has  a  particularly  high  gender  pay  gap,  there  can  be  a  number  of 
underlying factors which are causing this and further investigation of the data helps identify some of 
these  factors.  Once  underlying  causes  for  gender  pay  gap  are  understood,  the  trust  may  take 
suitable steps to minimise it.  

It differs from an equal pay audit in that equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and 
women  who  carry  out  the  same  work,  similar  work  or  work  of  equal  value.  Pay  inequality  on  the 
grounds of gender has been unlawful since 1970. 

3.  Statutory Responsibility 

 

The trust is obliged to calculate, submit and publish the following information:  

  The mean and median gender pay gap  

  The mean and median bonus gender pay gap  

  The proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  

  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band  

  A  written  statement,  authorised  by  an  appropriate  senior  person,  which  confirms  the 

accuracy of the calculations.  

 

4.  Methodology  

 

Full explanations of how the data is calculated may be found in Appendix 1. The date range for the 
bonus pay* data is the financial year 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017; however the basic pay itself is 
a snapshot as at 31 March 2017.   

*Bonus pay primarily relates to Clinical Excellence Awards (CEA’s) at this trust.

The  overall  position  is  that  there  is  an  average  gender  pay  gap  of  34%  across  the  trust.  To 
understand this further, the data by pay-band was reviewed, as demonstrated in the following graph;

Female Male

 

The trust’s gender profile as at 31 March 2017 was 84% female and 16% male. 

The data indicates that the higher the pay-scale / seniority of a role the greater likelihood of finding a 
larger proportion of men in comparison to the overall gender profile of the trust.  
 
There is also a difference between the gender split of staff on personal salaries (which often attract 
higher pay); however numbers are low.  
 
The hourly pay comparisons in graph 2, demonstrate that the hourly rate for men tends to be lower 
than  women  across  all  Agenda  for  Change  (AfC)  bandings,  with  the  exception  of  Band  8d;  and 
whilst  the  gender  split  of  staff  on  personal  salaries  is  50/50,  there  is  a  marked  difference  in  the 
average hourly pay depending upon the gender of the employee.

The  profile  of  our  medical  &  dental  staff  workforce  is  58%  male.  Medical  &  dental  staff  generally 
earn higher salaries than the  majority of  AfC staff and there is a higher proportion of male staff in 
senior medical positions (69% of our Consultant workforce is male), as shown  within the following 
graph.

The proportion of males receiving a

The proportion of females receiving a 
bonus payment  
 
The  overall  position  is  that  there  is  an  average  bonus  gender  pay  gap  of  almost  37%  across  the 
trust and the median findings in table 2 suggest that men are likely to receive bonus payments that 
are higher than the average and women’s bonus payments are likely to be lower. This is likely to be 
due to not only the gender split of staff receiving  bonus payments but also the full time / part time 
profile of staff in posts that attract these payments, as bonus payments are not adjusted to account 
for part time workers.

The findings in table 3 are based on an assumption that all employees could be eligible for bonus 
payments.  However,  99%  of  these  payments  are  CEA’s;  only  available  to  Consultant  medical  & 
dental  staff.  A  manual  re-run  of  the  data  based  on  a  smaller  number  of  eligible  employees 
(Consultants  only)  demonstrates  that  the  proportion  of  men  receiving  bonus  payments  is  21.85% 
and women is 9.09%, a gap of almost 13%.

For  the purposes of this report, the pay information for the trust  is divided equally into 4  quartiles; 
Smaller  salaries  sit  in  the  1st quartile,  and  higher  salaries  in  the  4th.  The  question  is  looking  to 
understand what proportion of male/female employees fall into each pay quartile.  

We understand from Q1 that we have an average gender pay gap of 34% so as anticipated, males 
are over-represented in the 4th quartile. We do however see under-representation of men in the 2nd 
and 3rd quartiles.

6.  Conclusions 

 

The trust’s workforce is predominantly female, a similar position to most NHS Trusts. Pay-scales are 
set nationally, supported by local starting salary and pay progression processes which are designed 
to support equity and fairness. However, there is a gender pay gap across the workforce in relation 
to seniority of roles and pay, including CEA’s.  

The  gender  pay  gap  report  has  afforded  the  opportunity  to  perform  a  deeper  analysis  of  the  data 
upon which to base an action plan. In summary the following conclusions can be drawn; 

  Average  pay  findings  are  significantly  affected  by  the  medical  &  dental  workforce  profile, 

where women are under-represented, particularly in senior clinical roles 

  There  is  an  equal  gender  split  of  staff  on  personal  salary  pay-scale,  however  there  is  a 

marked difference in the average hourly pay. 

  As  the  seniority  of  a  role  increases,  so  does  the  likelihood  of  a  greater  proportion  of  men, 

which does not reflect the ‘whole Trust’ profile.  

  Almost  22%  of  our  male  Consultants  are  in  receipt  of  CEA’s,  in  comparison  with  9%  of 

female Consultants.  

  Men are under-represented in the 2nd and 3rd pay quartiles and their hourly rates are lower 

than women across all AfC bandings, with the exception of Band 8d 
 
 

7.  Ambition and Actions 

 

The  trust’s  ambition  is  to  be  a  fair,  inclusive  and  progressive  employer,  attracting  a  wider  pool  of 
potential  recruits  for  vacancies.  The  trust  strives  to  develop  a  workforce  that  feels  valued  and 
engaged  through  a  culture  committed  to  tackling  inequality.  A  number  of  projects  are  already  in 
place  to  support  this;  such  as  working  with  schools  to  promote  NHS  careers  and  address  gender 
stereotyping  and  the  development  of  work  experience  opportunities  aimed  at  young  men.  The 
following  recommendations  seek  to  begin  to  address  the  findings  within  this  report  and  support 
measurable progress in terms of reducing the gaps;
