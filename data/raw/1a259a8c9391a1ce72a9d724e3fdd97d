                    Gender pay gap reporting           Info        Gender pay gap reporting    Gender pay reporting legislation requires all UK organisations employing 250 or more people from April 2017 to annually publish their gender pay gap reports.   View all reports on the government portal  Read our full gender pay gap report   Our figures show, like the majority of other NHS Trusts, we have a gender imbalance.  On average (median) men are paid just over 16% more than the women in our organisation.  We take equality and diversity very seriously, and acknowledge we have some way to go to redress the gender pay gap within our Trust. However, we are putting in place gender equality action plans and new initiatives to ensure we tackle this imbalance as quickly as possible and in a fair and robust manner.  A positive, open and learning culture is extremely important to us, and will help us continue to deliver the highest quality of care.
