It also contains an in-depth look at a wide range of workforce metrics by protected characteristic, such as service area, salary band, staff group, applicants for jobs, disciplinaries, performance management, grievances, dignity at work cases, redundancies and leavers and staff development (training).      This report compares this years’ data with that from previous years’ to provide a greater insight into the pace of change within DCHS    Achieving a better understanding of our workforce, and their needs, is a priority for the Trust; DCHS is continuing to take action to improve the collection of accurate employee information, including communicating to staff why we need it and what difference it will make to them.
