Organisations with more than 250 employees are required to publish specific gender pay data by April 2018.  For Sodexo this meant publishing gender pay data for five legal entities in the UK:   Sodexo Ltd  Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Community Rehabilitation Company Ltd  Cumbria & Lancashire Community Rehabilitation Company Ltd  Tillery Valley Foods Ltd  Sodexo Remote Sites Scotland Ltd (Sodexo Energy & Resources)   Andy Rogers, Sodexo UK & Ireland HR director, said: “At Sodexo we believe achieving gender balance is not only the right thing to do, it also enables people and our business to perform better. This belief is supported by global internal research which found our own gender-balanced management teams outperform those that are not across a number of key performance indicators.  “Sodexo’s mission is to improve quality of life for people. Publishing our gender pay gap is one step on the journey to creating an inclusive culture where everyone can flourish.”         Download the Sodexo gender pay report      Download the report     Read the early adopter press release   Read the press release         Back to top        Back to top           Quicklinks   Contact  Sitemap  Legal & Privacy      Quicklinks   About us  A-Z of Services  Corporate Responsibility  Careers              © Sodexo 2016
