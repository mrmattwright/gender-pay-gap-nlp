Gender Pay Gap Report  Gender pay gap reporting legislation, set out in an amendment to the Public Sector Equality Duty, requires all employers with more than 250 staff to publish annually, from 2017, information on the pay gap between their male and female staff.  A gender pay gap differs from equal pay. Equal pay legislation relates to unequal pay – a difference in pay between a man and a woman, or a group of men and a group of women, doing the same or a similar job, or a job of equal value – unequal pay is illegal. The gender pay gap shows the difference in pay between all the men employed by an organisation and all the women employed by an organisation – everyone in every role. It is possible to have equal pay while still having a gender pay gap.  Below please find our first Gender Pay Gap Report for 31 March 2017:  Gender Pay Gap Report 31.03.2017  Equality Duty and Specific Duties  Within the Public Sector Equality Duty there are two individual duties – the Equality or General Duty, and the Specific Duties.  The Equality or General Duty of the PSED requires organisations providing public services to:   eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and other prohibited conduct;  advance equality of opportunity, and  foster good relations   The Specific Duties of the PSED require organisations providing public services to:   publish information to demonstrate compliance with the PSED at least annually, and to  prepare and publish specific and measurable equality objectives at least every 4 years   The reports below relate to the first of the specific duties:   Public Sector Equality Duty Report 2018 (PDF 2010KB)  Public Sector Equality Duty Annual Report 2017  (PDF 915KB)  Public Sector Equality Duty Annual Report 2017 (Word 669KB)  Public Sector Equality Duty Annual Report 2016  (PDF 1052KB)  Public Sector Equality Duty Annual Report 2016 (Word 686KB)    PSED 2015 (PDF 1583KB)  PSED 2015 (Word 1558KB)    Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) Compliance Summary 2014 (PDF 1564KB)  Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) Compliance Summary 2014 (Word 3136KB)    Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) Compliance Summary 2013  (PDF 809KB)  Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) Compliance Summary 2013  (Word 1864KB)    Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) Compliance Summary 2011-2012 ( PDF 441KB )  Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) Compliance Summary 2011-2012  (Word 911KB)   The documents below relate to the second of the specific duties:   Equality Objectives 2017  (PDF 523KB)  Equality Objectives 2017  (Word 247KB)    Bridgewater Equality Objectives 2012-16 v3  (PDF 363KB)  Bridgewater Equality Objectives 2012-16 v3  (Word 247KB)   NHS organisations (from April 2015) must use the Equality Delivery System 2 (EDS2) as part of their evidence towards compliance with the PSED.
