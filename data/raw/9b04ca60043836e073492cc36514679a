Expenditure over £500 Overview  Cumbria Constabulary and the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) are committed to transparency in all our dealings, including how and where tax payers’ money is spent. We believe that publication of this information will also improve value for money in the long term by allowing residents to challenge the Constabulary and the Authority on how it spends money. This includes costs, supplier and transaction information and is published monthly on the PCC's website. Any sole trader or body acting in a business capacity in receipt of payments of at least £500 of public money should expect such payments to be transparent.  The data sets also include grants to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector where they are over £500. Information has only been excluded from publication where:   disclosure of information would breach the Data Protection Act 1998  the information relates to the protection of vulnerable adults or children  the information is confidential or would attract an exemption under the Freedom of Information Act e.g. where disclosure could be prejudicial to the commercial interests of any person including the authority   Pay Multiple  The following figure is the ratio between the highest paid salary and the median average salary of the whole organisation’s workforce.
