Including Astonbrook and at the snapshot date of 5th April 2017, the group employed 913 staff. The number of employees at each company varied between a high of 90 staff to a low of 21 staff members. As is the norm in the care industry, the majority of employees are female. In Astonbrook Care’s case, 89% are females. This in some circumstances has affected the statistics as the number of males in a sample is disproportionate to females. In addition 71% of the employees are on a salary equivalent to the minimum wage rate or the appropriate Apprenticeship rate. The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap) imposes obligations on employers with 250 or more employees to publish information relating to the gender pay gap in their organisation. In particular, employers are required to publish six pre-determined differences between the average hourly rate of pay paid to male and female employees. These six are reviewed below.   The Gender Pay Gap as a mean average shows males earning 11.15% more than females. The female and male average hourly rates in the second and third quartile remain the same. Variations occur in the first quartile where females earn a higher average hourly rate. However, the variation is more noticeable within the senior positions of the company and this is reviewed in the Quartile section later.  The Gender Pay Gap as a median is influenced by the number of staff on the minimum wage. As commented earlier and as a consequence, the average for both females and males employees is the same. For that reason we are reporting a ‘nil’ variance.  The bonus system is skewed as it only includes six individuals. Five, all based in one department, are paid dependent upon monthly performances. Irrespective of gender, if the bonus is paid, the same amount is paid to them all. The sixth person is paid a bonus based upon annual performances. Centred upon the small sample the figures are weighted towards the Male gender because of the sixth person referred to above. The total monthly bonus cost for all six individuals is £740. The average bonus pay gap using the mean average is 34.38%. The average hourly rate for this one department puts them in the lower section of the fourth quartile. Their pay is above the minimum wage, but they are below average within the fourth quartile.  Using the same small group as above, but applying the median, the average is 25%. As above, this is reflecting the small sample and the different reasons for paying the bonus.  As a gender, the proportion of males receiving the bonus is 2% whilst for females it is 0.5%. It is influenced by the number of females employed compared to those being paid a bonus and equally with the few males employed compared to the number of females. What may be considered an anomaly is due to the small sample.  The department paying bonuses is predominantly female, like the rest of the company.  The proportion of Females to Males in each quartile is consistent for the first three quartiles.  The first quartile is influenced by the number of female Apprentices, whose wage is age related. The mix of ages show females earning on average a higher hourly wage than males. To remedy this the Company would have to attract more young male apprentices into the Caring industry. The second and third quartiles are the same. This is a strange coincidence and the statistics have been rechecked to confirm their accuracy. The main impact upon these two quartiles is the high number of staff on minimum wage. The minimum wage statistical population covers the first three quartiles.  However, the first three quartiles proportion of females to males remain consistent throughout.      Female  Male    First Quartile  89.23%  10.77%    Second Quartile  89.74%  10.26%    Third Quartile  89.74%  10.26%    Fourth Quartile  84.62%  15.38%    The fourth quartile shows the proportion of males in the higher salaried quartile increasing. Whilst the other quartiles are heavily influenced by standard job descriptions with standard salary ranges for a common role within the Caring industry, the fourth quartile includes employees who are on individual contracts. The data reflects two points of interest; this quartile remains heavily influenced by females in this sector and where roles are not necessarily linked to the industry, males are being marginally more successful, but they still remain in the minority. The highest paid person within the company is female. In summary the statistics are skewed based upon a number of factors which may be common to the Care industry. Based upon 913 employees, the vast majority of the employees are female, the vast majority of employees are on the Governments minimum pay scale and bonuses are predominantly paid to one department and is based upon a small sample.
