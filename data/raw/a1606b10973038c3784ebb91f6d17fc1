It is evident there are pay gaps between male and female employees however, the disparities can be explained by experience, job role and level of position within the company, particularly the low, but growing, percentage of women sales executives.    As a company we employ significantly more men than women. This is generally typical across the automotive industry however we have no prejudices with either gender when it comes to recruitment for the range of job roles across the organisation. The same ethos is adopted when it comes to promoting from within the company. We only require applicants to exhibit the relevant skills, experience and eagerness to join the ever-growing Trade Centre team.    With the recent opening of our flagship store in the West Midlands we now have more female team members than ever, including some of our leading sales executives. We are excited to forecast a rapid expansion throughout the UK and alongside this we aim to minimise the pay gap.    This report has been compiled by the company and submitted to the Government UK website as per regulations – Andy Coulthurst, CEO.
