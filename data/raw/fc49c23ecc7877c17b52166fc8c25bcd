Our approach to tackling gender pay equality aligns with our wider approach to diversity & inclusion, and being a responsible business â€“ not just to do things right, but to do the right things. It is an integral part of how we operate our business, and is underpinned by our vision and values.  We know that this proactive approach enables us to be a better firm. It helps us attract and retain the very best talent and deliver the best service and experience to our clients.  We are pleased with the progress we have made so far by lowering our gender pay gap over recent years. And whilst our gender pay gap compares favourably with similar organisations we recognise there is still some work to be done. We are committed to improve equality of opportunity.
