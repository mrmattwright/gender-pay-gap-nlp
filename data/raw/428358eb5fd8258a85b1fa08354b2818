We recognise the need to support our staff to meet the diverse needs of the population we are proud to serve.  There are big changes happening in our communities  We have a growing population and increasing numbers of young and old. We know that both our workforce and communities are highly diverse. Getting equality, diversity and inclusion right for our staff, patients, carers, patients, families and communities supports the delivery of our top objectives and goal to be an employer of choice.  The priority in 2016/17 is to develop our work plans and resilience for sustainability and growth in these areas. This will ensure our patients are cared for, and our staff work in, a culture that embraces and acts on equality, diversity and inclusion.  We will ensure we meet our statutory and national obligations and regularly update our website with information on our actions.
