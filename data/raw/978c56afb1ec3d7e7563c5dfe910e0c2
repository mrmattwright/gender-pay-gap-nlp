We currently employ more women than men in each pay quartile (see table).  All trainees and new staff are recruited under the same structure and their earning ability depends on their success and career progress. All employees are encouraged to grow and earn to their full potential. Any pay gap difference shown will be a result of differing roles & bandings, however all employees working in the same bandings will be earning the same rewards. Measures will take time to show, however through training, mentoring and support we will aim to reduce the pay gap figures so that it represents a more balanced and equal situation.  We strive to continually improve our gender gap and will publish the results annually as a requirement of the government initiative into equal pay.      2016-2017 Gender Pay Gap                  About Painsley Catholic College  Awards  Board of Directors  College Admissions  College Performance Reports  Disabled Access  Extra-curricular  Financial Statements  Gallery  Latest News  Leadership at Painsley  Newsletters  Ofsted Report  Prospectus  Pupil Premium  Rights Respecting School  SEND  Support Sessions  Vacancies    Latest News    Joint statement from the Board of Directors of The Painsley Catholic Academy and Holy Trinity Academy  Mar 26    Painsley Catholic College gains World Class School Quality Mark!
