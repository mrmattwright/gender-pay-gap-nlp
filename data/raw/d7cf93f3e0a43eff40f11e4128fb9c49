It is the Company's policy not to discriminate against our workers and those who apply for employment.  Our Equal Opportunities, Diversity and Inclusion Policy is designed not only to comply with the law but also to ensure a highly effective workplace for all of our employees. Our workers and applicants for employment shall not be disadvantaged by any policies or conditions of service that are not necessary for the operation of the Company. Buckingham Group Contracting Ltd intends to achieve this objective by:   Actively promoting equality of opportunities  Encouraging and assisting all categories of employees to develop their potential to the full  Providing training to all employees in Fairness, Inclusion and Respect via the 'Supply Chain Sustainability School' e-learning modules and 'Respect for All' within 'All Ways Safely' our behavioural safety programme  Striving at all times to promote best practice as well as work within legislative requirements   Gender Pay Gap & Bonus Statistics  Annual Gender Pay Gap reporting became a legislative requirement for all companies with 250 or more employees in April 2017. The following statistics are presented for the whole company and make no differentiation between roles, (e.g. administration, operational or technical), or locations (e.g. Construction Site or Office based).  Buckingham Group is committed to setting equal pay as defined by the Equality Act 2010. We are confident that our male and female staff are paid equally for undertaking equivalent jobs with due consideration of the variances between the skills and experience of respective people.  We work hard to ensure our policies and practices are fair, this includes formal reviews of recruitment, training, development, pay and bonuses.  Pay and Bonus Gap  The following table shows our mean and median gender pay gap as at 5th April 2017. Bonus figures are based on those employees eligible for bonus (which excludes some employees who joined or left the company during the reporting period), and the bonuses paid in 2017 that were earned between June 2016 and March 2017.   Proportion of Employees Receiving a Bonus   The Company's generous profit related bonus scheme is discretionary, open for all eligible employees (paid pro‐rata in the year of joining), and is based on a range of personal performance measures alongside achieving defined business targets.  The gender bonus gap for 2017 reflects positive company profit performance and the enhanced bonus criteria for senior managers who are predominantly male.  The Proportion of Male and Female Employees in Each Quartile Pay Band   Analysis of the data used in the preceding table demonstrates that our higher paid employees are generally operational, technical and site based personnel.  Buckingham Group is a ‘traditional’ contractor focussed on delivering projects in the heavy civil engineering, rail, demolition, and building sectors.  The nature of our business, with a focus on the delivery of construction projects across a broad geographic area, has historically attracted a larger proportion of male employees.  In parallel with the construction industry in general, this has changed too slowly over recent years and the business firmly supports initiatives to attract more women into contracting.  The Actions That we are Taking  Buckingham Group has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. In line with the construction industry in general, we are focussing our efforts on addressing the recognised skills shortages. In doing so, we are actively promoting our company and the industry through a number of key initiatives.  Attracting People  Buckingham Group promotes Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to young people in schools, colleges, universities and youth and community groups via our existing trained, experienced STEM Ambassadors and CITB Ambassadors. They are assisted by our HR and Training Department who support all our trainees, apprentices and graduates through a structured, managed, and monitored training programme to ensure that every individual reaches their maximum potential. Over the past three years we have recruited 79 trainees, apprentices and graduate trainees, of this total:   21% are female  20% have confirmed their status as BAME   Developing our People  We currently support:   9% of staff in educational training  17% of employees via NVQ training  13% of staff via Professional Body Accreditation (ICE, RICS, CIOB, ICES)   Retaining our People  Buckingham Group provides a wide range of employee support and benefits from Occupational Health and Wellbeing support to flexible working, childcare vouchers, holiday purchase, income protection, bike to work and retail discounts schemes.  In 2017 our employees voted the company one of the 'Sunday Times Top 100 Best Companies to work for'.  I confirm that the data reported above and supporting information is accurate and reflects the measures being implemented by the company to address and reduce the gender pay gap.
