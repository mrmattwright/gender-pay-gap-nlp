•  Gender pay differs from equal pay 

-  Equal pay deals with the pay differences 
between men and women who carry out 
the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal 
value – it is unlawful to pay people unequally 
because of gender

-  Gender pay shows the differences in the mean 

and median pay between men and women

•  This report covers Chelsea Football Club 
Limited, which has over 250 employees, 
including our first team players. Due to the 
composition of our businesses, some functions 
are excluded, for example, Chelsea Ladies. 
The Chelsea Foundation is also reported 
as a separate entity. To provide greater 
transparency in the spirit of the reporting we 
have also provided the data without these 
male players and coaching staff
