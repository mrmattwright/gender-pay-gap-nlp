Gender Pay Gap 
At Age Partnership we recognise that gender pay gaps exist across our sector, and even though our gap is in line with 
the average for financial services, we are strongly committed to reducing this further, with pleasing results having 
already been demonstrated.

The quartile information shows the gender pay distribution in four different sections of the business at Age Partnership 
during the period April 2016 â€“ April 2017.

We recognise that a gender pay gap exists at Age Partnership. As a forward-thinking, transparent business we are 
clear that whilst a gender pay gap exists, equal pay within all roles across the business also exists - something we are 
extremely passionate about.

All employees at Age Partnership who carry out the same roles are paid the same rate of pay, regardless of gender. 
This applies to all departments company wide.

The reason for our mean gender pay gap of 24.4% is due to a gender imbalance in the wider financial services sector, 
which has led to a higher percentage of males being employed in roles that command higher salaries at Age 
Partnership; this includes the senior team.

As of 5th April 2017 Age Partnership had a workforce composition of 61.9% males and 38.1% females. As a result of 
the focus to make Age Partnership an employer of choice regardless of gender, in 2017 we recruited 46.5% females 
and 53.5% males, seeing an improvement in our gender balance.

In spite of the Age Partnership mean gender pay gap being in line with the financial services, we continue to make 
strides to reduce it yet further, whilst still recruiting the most suitable people for the right role and department.

I can confirm that the data and information compiled in the document is accurate.
