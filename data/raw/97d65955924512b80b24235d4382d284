We seek to employ a workforce which reflects the diverse community at large, as we value the contribution of individuals irrespective of sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, race, colour, religion, belief, political opinion, ethnic or national origin, nationality, or any other non-job related consideration.  We will not tolerate discrimination in the workplace and aim to ensure that each employee feels valued, and has the opportunity to contribute fully to the success of the firm.  We aim to create an inclusive environment where leaders can capitalise on diverse styles and perspectives, and to develop an atmosphere where diverse teams work well together.  As part of our commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion we have been awarded the UK National Equality Standard .  Gender Pay Report 2017  Gender pay reporting legislation requires all employers with over 250 employees to publish on the Government's website and our own website, 6 statutory calculations every year to show the pay gap between male and female employees. The figures for all companies need to reflect a ‘snapshot‘ of pay data taken at 5 April 2017. Because the number of men and women performing different jobs varies, and different jobs have different salaries, a gender pay gap exists. We are committed to reducing our gender pay gap.

Diversity   In broad terms, diversity is any dimension that can be used to differentiate groups and people from one another.  It means respect for and appreciation of differences in ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, education, and religion.  But it's more than this.  We all bring with us diverse perspectives, work experiences, life styles and cultures.  As a source and driver of innovation, diversity is a "big idea" in business and in society.   Inclusion   Inclusion is a state of being valued, respected and supported.  It's about focusing on the needs of every individual and ensuring the right conditions are in place for each person to achieve his or her full potential.  Inclusion should be reflected in an organisation's culture, practices and relationships that are in place to support a diverse workforce.  In simple terms, diversity is the mix; inclusion is getting the mix to work well together.
