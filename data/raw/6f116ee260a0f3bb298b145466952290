VOCARE LIMITED – GENDER PAY GAP REPORT AS AT 31ST MARCH 2017 

 
We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Gap Reporting. 
 
This  involves  carrying  out  a  series  of  calculations  that  show  the  difference  between  the  average 
earnings of men and women in our organisation; it does not involve publishing individual employee 
data. 
 
Vocare  Limited  used  payroll  information  to  source  the  data.    This  was  cross-checked  against  data 
maintained in our human resources and rota management systems to ensure that all relevant staff 
were included correctly.  The report was compiled using a snapshot of data which was validated to 
ensure statistical comparability.  Bonus data included a Christmas bonus paid to staff.  We undertook 
this analysis with support from expert external advisors.   
 
We are using this information to assess: 
- 
- 
-  How effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded. 
 
Vocare Limited is committed to the principle of gender pay equality and since the reporting date is 
progressing initiatives toward this. 
 
This is the first gender pay gap published by Vocare Limited.  The results are detailed below and are 
further accessible via the dedicated UK government website: 
 
1.  Difference in hourly rate 
 
-  Women’s mean hourly rate is 10.5% lower than men’s.  In other words when comparing mean
