There is sometimes confusion between equal pay and the gender pay gap. Equal pay is concerned with paying people equally for doing equivalent work to the same level of performance regardless of gender. The gender pay gap refers to the difference in average hourly pay between all men and all women in a workforce. A gender pay gap typically results from an imbalance in the workforce, such as having more men than women in senior roles.  We are confident that all employees are paid fairly and equally where men and women are performing the same work to the same standard, but there is further work to be done to increase the number of women working in financial services, and increasing the representation of women at senior levels.
