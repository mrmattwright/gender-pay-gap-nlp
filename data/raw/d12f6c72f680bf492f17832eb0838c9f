We have produced this short report, which meets the relevant regulations, showing the differences in average pay between men and women working for the Society. The figures have been calculated using Society data as at 5 April 2017.  As a Co-operative, creating a better, fairer world is part of our purpose. We have four core values that underpin this and guide the way we work – Democracy, Openness, Equality and Social Responsibility. Equality ensures we commit to being a diverse and inclusive employer. Pleasingly, this commitment and our work in this area has been recognised by Business in the Community, who have awarded us a 5 star rating for our socially responsible business practices.  Producing this report has provided us with a welcome opportunity to assess the gender equality within our organisation and outline how we plan to reinforce our supportive culture through further action.
