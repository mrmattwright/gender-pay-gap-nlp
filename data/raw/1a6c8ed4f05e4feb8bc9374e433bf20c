Women on average are paid 10.2% less than men, with the figure reducing to just over 6% as a median, thereby illustrating our pay gap is well below national levels. The figure purely represents the difference in average pay of men and women without reference to their particular job. All jobs are objectively evaluated and awarded pay relative to the work done.  With a small workforce of just over 300 people (including contractors and casuals), Mole Valley has outsourced highly manual operations such as waste collection. Councils that retain these services and directly employ manual workers are more likely to pay men on average less than women and therefore have a negative pay gap.  Mole Valley already offers a variety of flexible working arrangements across the organisation and will be looking to maximise agile working arrangements with the opportunities that technology developments provide, thereby enabling Mole Valley to be an inclusive employer, recruiting and retaining people with the right skills for the job.
