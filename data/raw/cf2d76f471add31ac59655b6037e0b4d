Agilisys fundamentally believes that men and 
women should be paid equally for equivalent 
jobs across our organisation. We will continue 
to review our policies and procedures to ensure 
practices are fair, and we commit to taking 
action to focus on diversity across our business.

The information presented in the report is 
accurate with April 2017 as the reference date 
for pay, and a 12 month reference period to 5 
April 2017 for bonus.

Simon Mounsey
Director of Human Resources

Primarily, the gender pay gap we see across our 
entities is caused by having more men in senior, 
and therefore higher paid, roles. The exception 
to this is Agilisys Contact Services Limited 
where the pay gap is low (4%), the bonus gap 
favourable to women, and where we have more 
women in senior, higher paid roles than men. 

The bonus gap across the other three entities 
is also affected by the number of part time 
opportunities across our business, which are 
mainly filled by women.

The area with the highest pay and bonus gaps 
is AG limited, which is the employment entity for 
those who transfer, via TUPE, into Agilisys. 

There are three main factors for this:

1.  AG has more men in higher paid roles 

which has a major effect on the pay gap

2.  The effect of London weighting on local 
government pay scales has an impact in 
this entity 

3.  There are more women in part time roles 

in the entity than men and typically 
employees with local government terms 
and conditions are not entitled to a bonus
