Turner UK Gender Pay Gap
Report 2017

New regulations ask for all UK organisations 
above 250 employees to publish specific data 
related to their gender pay gap as set out below. 
The data shown reflects the combined findings for 
Turner’s two UK employing entities of Turner 
Broadcasting System Europe Ltd. and Cable News 
International Ltd. both of which are registered in 
the UK and operate internationally. At the end of 
the report we include the individual data for the 
two entities as required by the legislation.

Turner places great importance on equality, 
diversity and inclusion within the workplace as 
vital cultural drivers and critical to our success. 
It is important to be clear that “equal pay” and 
“gender pay gap” are two separate concepts. 
Our equal pay framework is robust and 
consistent. We are confident that we continue to 
deliver equal reward for like for like work. We will 
continue to monitor and protect this as a 
fundamental right for staff at Turner.

Proportion of Employees Receiving a Bonus 
(Combined Turner UK Entities)

You can see from the proportion of men and 
women receiving a bonus that we have a fair and 
equitable system when it comes to bonus 
eligibility. Our employees across the business 
have an equal opportunity to participate in our 
bonus schemes, as part of our commitment to 
an equal pay framework.

Pay & Bonus Gap and Quartile Data
(Combined Turner UK Entities)
This report analyses data relating to Turner’s 
employees in the UK, as required by the new 
regulations. However, since Turner is a global 
business with senior executives based in 
multiple offices, to focus only on the UK does 
not provide a full picture. We have top female 
leaders across our business as a whole, with 
strong female representation in our Europe and 
international executive teams. Non-UK based 
roles overseeing UK business are nonetheless 
not accounted for in this UK analysis. At the 
same time, we do have a number of senior male 
executives with responsibility for Turner's 
international businesses who are based in 
London and who are therefore taken into 
account.

Additionally, a high proportion of the CNN 
newsroom’s on air talent in the UK is female, a 
fact reflected in the mean hourly pay gap number 
for Cable News International Ltd., which is shown 
on page 3.

CNN’s operation in the UK is also primarily a 
newsgathering and production hub, as opposed 
to a wholly contained headquarters, and as a 
result there is a disproportionally large number of 
technical roles that attract higher average 
salaries due to market rates and competition; 
these positions tend to index heavily towards men 
and this is reflected industry wide. Finally, many of 
the senior management roles that have oversight 
responsibility for UK based employees are 
women, but they are based in the United States, 
and their salaries are therefore not included in 
this data.

* The mean is a comparison of the average pay for a woman 
and the average pay for a man. The median is a comparison of 
the middle pay for a woman if all pay amounts were sorted from 
low to high and the middle pay for a man if all pay amounts were 
sorted from low to high.

The gender hourly pay gap and bonus gap are 
measures of the difference in the average pay of 
men and women, regardless of the role they fulfil, 
across the entire entity.

The quartile data sets show the percentage 
of men and women in each pay quartile when 
all our UK staff are split into four equal sized 
groups based on their pay. The above data 
shows we have strong female representation in 
entry and junior levels, but progressively lower 
representation of women in the upper two 
quartiles. Therefore, the underlying factor that 
principally impacts our data set is that we have 
more men than women in the more senior, and 
therefore higher paid, roles across the Turner UK 
business.

Within Turner we are strongly committed 
to gender diversity as a key business 
priority. We see from our UK gender pay 
data that we clearly have more work to 
do. We are determined to be even more 
focused on improving diversity across our 
workforce and doing more to progress 
female talent more often, more quickly, 
and into more senior roles to ensure 
better female representation across all 
company lines. In terms of gender 
equality, our overall goal is a more 
diverse representation not just at every 
level of the company, but across every 
function.

Current Initiatives

Future Initiatives

We have a number of initiatives in place as part of 
our ongoing talent management processes and 
HR policies. These include:

• An assessment of our succession planning and

•

internal promotions process
In-depth discussions, both individually and in
networking groups, with the many senior female
leaders we already have across the business to
understand and act on their own experiences,
learnings and advice

• A commitment to diverse recruitment pools and

targeting a diverse shortlist of candidates for
each role with a 50:50 ratio where possible; and
providing the necessary training and support to
ensure we are considering the best mix of male
and female candidates

• Our global women’s development programmes,

including initiatives like Breakthrough
Leadership, which develops female leaders
across all the business units of Time Warner
• Our upcoming roll-out of Conscious Inclusion

training

• We are an active member of the FT125 Women’s
Forum and other women-focused media groups
across the world

• Flexible working policies, which we are currently
reviewing in collaboration with staff and leaders

• Encouraging a greater take-up of shared

parental leave

• Engaging with employee focus groups to hear

directly from our staff on any potential barriers
to progress that we can help to remove

Longer term, we are looking forward to our early 
careers programme, which includes three and 12 
month internships and an apprenticeship 
programme, not only to diversify our pool of 
potential talent, but also to help encourage 
better career progression through our company 
from the start.

We also anticipate that mentoring, sponsorship 
and more structured support for returning 
parents may be new initiatives that our 
employees would welcome and ones that we are 
ready and keen to implement. In the spirit of the 
employee focus groups we are shortly 
conducting, we will carry these out first before 
embarking on implementation, to ensure that 
new measures reflect and embrace employee 
feedback.

As well as the change that we at Turner believe 
we can bring about within our own organisation, 
we also recognise there are cultural and societal 
drivers to the gender pay gap at a broader 
industry level.

In our experience, certain roles and functions 
have a larger male representation in the UK 
market, which is reflected in the currently 
available talent pool. The UK is where Turner’s 
central hubs for these functions are based, which 
then serve our wider business as a whole. We in 
the media industry need to consider what we can 
do collectively to encourage more women to 
enter the industry, particularly in those roles that 
tend now to be more male-skewed, and to make 
it easier for women generally to navigate through 
to the more senior roles.

We are eager to play a part in any future industry 
initiatives that emerge and to discuss any of our 
own initiatives that have seen success.

We will build on the many positives our 
workforce already reflects in terms of 
equal pay and a strong commitment to 
further awareness around the 
importance of diversity and inclusion for 
career development, to ensure that all 
Turner employees feel there are no 
barriers to them progressing throughout 
the organisation, not just in the UK but 
across our entire business.

We are committed to expanding the measures 
above to help us do this and to working with our 
staff to do so.
