2017 UK Gender 
Pay Gap Report

We view diversity and inclusion as business-critical 
for Avon. We recognise that a broader mix of skills, 
opinions and experience enables us to make better 
business decisions. Behaviours to support this are 
also embedded in our global Code of Conduct, 
reinforced by our Global Women’s Strategy, which 
we introduced in 2014, and that it helps us better 
understand and reflect the diverse experiences, 
opinions and needs of our Representatives, 
customers and the communities we serve.

Our UK-based workforce is 73% female and we 
are proud that our long-established pay equity 
processes ensure we have fair and equitable pay 
for men and women doing the same or similar 
jobs. However, we have proportionately less 
women than men in our most senior leadership 
positions, offset by a field sales workforce that is 
predominantly female.

With this in mind, we welcome the opportunity the 
UK government’s new gender pay gap reporting 
legislation brings to shine a spotlight on workforces. 
This report sets out our own gender pay gap 
information, the underlying reasons for it, and 
outlines our ongoing plans to advance women  
at Avon.

We are committed to continuing our work to make 
sure we have a fair and inclusive workplace where 
all our people can thrive.

Group Vice President,  
Western Europe

Welcome

Avon is committed to pursuing a 
global culture that respects and fully 
values the strengths and differences of 
all our employees. Our goal is to offer 
a work environment where everyone 
feels engaged and understood; one 
that is inclusive of people of all 
genders, races, religions, sexual 
orientations and abilities. This is so we 
make sure everyone feels comfortable 
and encouraged to bring his or her 
‘whole self’ to work.

Avon’s history of  
advancing women
  In 1886, before women had earned 
the right to vote, Avon’s founder, 
David H. McConnell, helped give 
them the chance to earn an 
independent income. And since 
then, our business has been offering 
women the opportunity to achieve 
their personal financial goals.
  Today around six million self-
employed Representatives sell Avon 
products in more than 70 countries 
worldwide supported by our global 
workforce of almost 25,000 Avon 
associates, 60% of whom are women.

We view diversity and inclusion as 

business-critical for Avon. We recognise 

that a broader mix of skills, opinions 
and experience enables us to make 

better business decisions.

2017 UK Gender Pay Gap ReportWhat is the  
gender  
pay gap?

The UK government has made it compulsory for 
any organisation with 250 or more employees to 
publish and report specific figures about their 
gender pay gap. Our figures show the difference 
in the average pay and bonuses of women and 
men across Avon’s UK-based organisation, 
regardless of the nature of their work and their 
roles. It is influenced by a range of factors, in 
particular the different number of men and 
women within our senior leadership and field 
sales-based populations.

The gender pay gap is different from 
equal pay 
Where the gender pay gap measures the difference 
in average pay across the entire organisation, equal 
pay compares the pay of two or more people 
carrying out the same, similar or equivalent work.

Avon has a strong commitment to proactively and 
continually monitoring pay equity across the 
organisation. Every year since 2014, we have 
partnered with independent global experts to 
perform an equal pay comparison across our global 
organisation, taking corrective action on an ongoing 
basis as required. As a result, we are confident there 
is pay equity between men and women across the 
organisation and we remain committed to 
maintaining these efforts to ensure consistency 
and objectivity in how we pay people.

How is our gender pay gap calculated?  
Organisations have been asked to show their gender pay gap through 
‘mean’ and ‘median’ pay statistics for a snapshot of UK-based employees 
on 5 April 2017. For us, it’s important to remember Avon’s Representative 
population, who are self-employed, are not included in this data. 

Mean gender pay gap 
The mean is the difference in the 
average hourly rate of pay across 
Avon in the UK for women 
compared to the average hourly 
rate of pay for men. 

 

Median gender pay gap 
The median pay gap represents 
the middle point of the total 
population of women at Avon in 
the UK compared to men. The 
median gender pay gap 
removes any influence of very 
high and very low pay.

Gender bonus pay 
The proportion of men and women awarded bonus pay over a 12-month 
period is also being reported, plus the median and mean difference 
between bonuses paid. For the purpose of this analysis we have classed 
an employee’s bonus as any type of variable pay (such as bonus, sales 
commission and long-term incentives).

 

Pay quartiles 
In addition, we are reporting on the percentage of men and women in each 
pay quartile. Quartiles are calculated by listing the rates of pay for each 
associate across the business from lowest to highest, before splitting that list 
into four equal-sized groups. 

About Avon in the UK 
In the UK, Avon has a total of 1,451 
associates, which is around 6% of our 
global workforce; 73% of these 
associates are women.

In late 2016, we relocated our corporate 
headquarters from New York to London, 
increasing the proportion of our most 
senior corporate positions based in the 
UK. The number of executive (director 
and above) roles based in the UK is 63, 
which constitutes 4% of our total UK 
workforce.

This is a breakdown of the roles in the UK:

   Around 40% of our UK workforce are 
employed in our direct selling 
business (DSB). This includes more 
than 350 field sales managers, the UK 
business functional teams and the UK 
leadership team; 86% of the UK DSB 
are female.

   Around 30% are employed within our 
supply chain and logistics and 
customer care functions; 65% of these 
associates are women.

   Around 30% are employed in our 
global corporate functions including 
human resources, finance, legal, 
marketing, communications and IT; 
64% of these associates are female.

2017 UK Gender Pay Gap ReportWhat is Avon’s gender pay gap?

Avon’s gender pay gap 
Across our 1,068 female and 383 male associates 
(as at 5 April 2017) there is a mean pay gap of 
31.5% and a lower median pay gap of 27.8%.

Avon’s gender bonus gap  
1,346 employees received a bonus for the 
12 months preceding 5 April 2017. The proportion 
of male and female employees receiving a bonus 
was almost equal, with 3.3% more males receiving 
a bonus proportionally.1 There is a mean bonus 
gap of 36.8% and a lower median bonus gap 
of 11.7%.

How pay is distributed in Avon  
To understand our pay gap better, we need to 
examine the proportion of men and women at 
different levels of seniority in the organisation 
(see page 5).
Our analysis of pay quartiles shows that women 
are in the majority in each of the four quartiles 
with the lower middle quartile particularly skewed 
by our predominantly female field sales 
managers. However, the proportion of women 
does reduce from 79% in the lowest, to 58% in the 
highest quartile, creating a gender pay gap.

1  All roles within Avon include a bonus or commission plan. 

There are minimum tenure and performance criteria to 
qualify. A slightly higher proportion of women did not qualify, 
largely driven by the fact that the majority of our new hires 
were female, meaning a higher proportion did not meet the 
minimum tenure required for bonuses.

2017 UK Gender Pay Gap ReportWhy there is a gender pay gap

The gender pay gap in Avon 
UK is being driven by a gender 
imbalance in two areas of our 
organisational structure.
Driver 1: Leadership imbalance
The first pay gap driver stems from  
the fact that Avon UK has more 
men than women in its 63 most  
senior positions (director and above).

58% of associates at manager and 
above level are women1; however, 
only 48% of people in director 
positions, and 29% of those in Vice 
President and above positions 
are women.

In addition, we have a higher 
proportion of senior roles based 
in the UK due to many of our 
global functions and our global 
headquarters being relocated 
there. Across Avon globally less than 
1.5% of roles are director and above; 
however, in the UK this rises to 4%.

While leaders are only a small 
proportion of our overall workforce, 
inevitably people in more senior roles 
receive the highest pay and reward 
(e.g. bonus), and thus the gender 
imbalance is a significant contributor 
to the gender pay gap.

Continuing our efforts to improve the 
representation of women at senior 
levels could help reduce the gender 
pay gap.

1  Managers+ directors+ VPs+ = 58%, which is 
equivalent to the upper pay quartile.

Driver 2: Field Sales Managers imbalance 
The second driver of Avon UK’s gender pay gap is a gender 
imbalance within field sales roles.

25% of our entire UK workforce are in a field sales management 
position; and 90% of this population are women. These roles 
are key to our business, as it is they who are the interface 
with the Representatives who sell our products.

Field sales manager roles sit in the middle tier of our 
organisation hierarchy (grade structure). However, these 
jobs attract a lower base salary than other roles at the same 
grade level. So, in terms of hourly (base salary) pay rate they 
fall closer to the bottom, in the lower and lower-middle pay 
quartiles. In contrast, they offer the opportunity to earn higher 
amounts of variable pay (e.g. sales commission). It is standard 
market practice for sales roles to have a lower base and 
higher variable pay.

Having such a high proportion of women in roles that sit in 
lower pay quartiles combines with the impact of having fewer 
women in roles with higher pay rates in the upper quartile to 
drive Avon UK’s gender pay gap. These main drivers are 
compounded by the fact we have some roles in the middle 
of our grade structure that attract shift premiums (e.g. some 
manufacturing and engineering roles); and within Avon UK 
these roles are carried out more often by men than by women.

Whereas the lower pay base in field sales drives up our gender 
pay gap, their higher variable pay contributes to a lower 
median bonus gap of 11.7%.

Part-time workers and bonus pay gap
But there is still a bonus gap. 16% of our female workforce 
work part time compared to only 1% of men. While bonus 
pay is pro-rated, the bonus calculation in this report does not 
adjust for this and therefore this higher proportion of part-time 
women contributes to the bonus pay gap, coupled with the 
higher bonus rates attached to our senior roles where there 
are fewer women.

2017 UK Gender Pay Gap ReportAvon’s commitment  
to advancing women 

Developing Talent

Pay Equity

Plans already well under way 
Advancing women is an ongoing strategic 
priority for Avon. Following detailed 
quantitative and qualitative research across 
our top six markets (including the UK), we 
introduced our Global Women’s Strategy 
in 2014.

This work has now been introduced across 
our top ten markets, including the UK, and 
focuses on making improvements across 
four key areas:

Development and progression  

of female talent

Assurance of fair and equitable 
pay through our annual pay audit

Flexible Working

Benefits

Global framework and principles 

adapted to local context

Ensuring competitive offering in 

line with local market

Progress made to date
Advancing women is a long-term strategy, but 
we’ve already made good progress. As a result 
we’ve seen an increase in the representation of 
women in our most senior levels across the UK 
since 2014. 

Our director population has 
increased from 45% to 48% 
women, and our Vice President 
and above from 15% to 29%.

We want to continue doing more, but in the UK 
specifically we’ve already made great strides in 
improving the way we support women in the 
workplace through:

   More robust flexible-working practices 

   An improved maternity benefits offering, 
including support for working parents through 
our ‘Return to Work’ and our ‘What to Expect 
When You’re Expecting’ coaching programmes

   Piloting a programme aimed at helping women 
address limiting beliefs to improve confidence 
and to create opportunities for informal 
networking

   Assuring fair and transparent pay through the 
annual pay equity audit 

   Conducting focus groups with women across a 
range of levels to understand how we can do 
more to help our female talent achieve their 
ambitions and meet their potential at Avon.

2017 UK Gender Pay Gap ReportOngoing plans

We know we need to do more to 
support more women at Avon to 
progress into our most senior 
roles. We also recognise we need 
to do more to attract more senior 
women into our business.

Our gender pay gap results in this report 
show, however, that we cannot afford to 
be complacent. Nor do we want to be. 
We will continue this journey by involving 
our people. We are guided by women in 
our business who regularly take part in 
focus groups as part of the Global 
Women’s Strategy. They have helped us 
identify a number of areas we want to 
concentrate on to further improve our 
gender diversity, particularly in more 
senior roles:

Equipping managers
 

 Supporting managers to help 
their teams drive their careers by 
providing specific training for 
managers that helps build their 
confidence in having meaningful 
conversations about their team’s 
career aspirations. Also that 
managers appreciate the 
different experiences women 
face when progressing their 
careers 

 

 Introducing Unconscious bias 
seminars for senior managers to 
help them operate as inclusive 
leaders, and build inclusive 
cultures within their teams

Developing talent
 

 Providing formal and informal 
development opportunities to 
inspire women to achieve their 
ambitions, with the tools to 
support 

 

 

 Empowering and enabling 
women to access informal 
mentoring and career guidance

 Giving women across the 
business the opportunity to build 
internal networks and hear from 
Avon role models and external 
speakers about how they have 
managed their own careers 

Flexible working for all
 

 Continuing to ensure flexible 
working opportunities are 
accessible to everyone and 
encouraged regardless of role 
or gender to empower every 
associate to achieve their goals 
inside and outside work
