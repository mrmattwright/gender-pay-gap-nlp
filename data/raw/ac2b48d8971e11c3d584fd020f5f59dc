From 6 April 2017, companies with more than 250 employees are required by law to publish their gender pay information, covering pay and bonuses, showing the overall difference between the earnings of men and women. Gender pay differs from equal pay as it is concerned with the differences in pay between men and women irrespective of their role; whereas, equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs. The TUV SUD Group does not tolerate discrimination and is committed to fairness, respect, inclusion and equal opportunity and recognises the importance of diversity to its success. The following report provides information on the gender pay gap for TUV SUD Limited, provides an understanding of the gap and what we are doing to address it. What is our gender pay gap? The table below shows our headline median and mean gender pay and bonus pay gap based on hourly rates of pay at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, and bonuses paid in the year ending 5 April 2017.  Median Mean Gender pay gap 29.0% 29.3% Gender bonus gap 49.4% 54.4%     Female Male The proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment 10.4% 14.4%    Proportion of females and males in each quartile band Female Male Upper quartile 8.2% 91.8% Upper middle quartile 15.7% 84.3% Lower Middle quartile 28.4% 71.6% Lower quartile 41.8% 58.2% Why do we have a gender pay gap? Like many other companies within the engineering, science and construction sectors, we have more males in senior positions than women. The gender bonus gap is a result of there being fewer women in senior positions where higher bonuses are paid; however, the proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment differs by only 4%. While women make up 23.5% of our overall workforce, only 8.2% of those attracting the highest levels of remuneration are female. What are we doing to address our gender pay gap? TUV SUD Limited is committed to reducing its gender pay gap and is progressing several actions: Engaging in a TÜV SÜD Global initiative to improve gender balance by increasing the proportion of women participating in our Corporate leadership courses to support their progression to more senior positions. Rolling out recruitment and diversity training for managers. In addition, further actions have been identified: Engaging with local educational institutions to promote careers in our core disciplines. Reviewing family-friendly policies (covering maternity, paternity, parental and adoption leave and supporting the transition back to work). Promoting our flexible working policy to potential and current employees. Providing equality, diversity and unconscious bias training for employees. Introducing a Corporate employer branding initiative to increase job applicant diversity. Declaration We confirm that the gender pay gap calculations for TUV SUD Limited are accurate and meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
