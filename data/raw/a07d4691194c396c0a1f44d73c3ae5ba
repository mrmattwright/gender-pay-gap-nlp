We aim to eliminate unlawful discrimination and promote equality of opportunity by ensuring that the values underpinning equality, diversity and human rights are integral to our service planning and delivery as well as employment practices.  The Trust is working towards the adoption of the NHS’ national Equality Delivery System (EDS2) as a framework to support our complying with equalities legislation and meeting the requirements of the Public Sector Equality Duty. The EDS2 aims to drive up equality performance and embed equality into our day-to-day work.  The EDS2 provides a range of outcomes against which we will assess our performance. We are keen to hear from our patients, their carers, visitors to the Trust, staff and local community groups about where we are performing well in relation to equality and diversity, as well as where and how we could improve.  If you have a view about how the RNOH is performing in relation to equalities issues, please email our Communications and Engagement Team on Communications.Dept@rnoh.nhs.uk.  Equality & Diversity objectives  We consulted on our equality & diversity objectives during December 2014 and January 2015 and, at its meeting on 28 January 2015, the Trust Board approved our equality objectives, outlined below. These objectives are now being used to establish an action plan for the Trust:   reduce gaps in equality information and data for patients and staff  enhance the analysis and use of patient data by protected group to inform our priorities and help improve our services  increase the diversity of our workforce including black minority ethnic staff (this would help meet the race equality standard) and younger people (through e.g. apprenticeships)  implement the NHS Equality Delivery System (EDS2)  build an inclusive environment for all staff aligned with our values   The Trust's Equality Achievement Network is now identifying actions to help us achieve these objectives. We published patient and staff equality data in January 2015 - analysis of this data will inform our action plan to improve services for our patients and the work environment for our staff.  Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES)  We are always looking for ways in which we can improve the working environment for staff and have adopted the Workforce Race Equality standard, which helps us to derive information about the experience of staff from a BME background.  The WRES is an analysis of our staff records and the staff survey results . The information suggests that we have made improvements since the introduction of this standard in 2015 but that there are still areas for improvements. Much of this work is underway and aims to improve the working environment for all our staff, not just for BME staff. We will take a snapshot of the same information next year and aim to act on the real opportunities for improvement.  Gender Pay Gap  Gender pay reporting legislation introduced in 2017 now requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. The first report uses data from 31 March 2017 and had to be publicly reported by 30 March 2018.  A gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women across an organisation, expressed relative to men’s earnings. This breakdown relies upon an analysis of the total workforce without allowing for any consideration of the different roles men and women have in the Trust.  Our gender pay analysis shows that at RNOH, there is a difference of 29.52% between the average hourly rate of men and women. However, if we were to remove our medical staff, where 74% of employees are male, the gender pay gap reduces to 8.36%. More details and calculations can be found in the report accessible below.  Gender pay gap calculations are different to equal pay. The NHS has a national pay structure and job evaluation system for staff on Agenda for Pay bands and Medical and Dental grades to ensure that men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value are paid the same. At the RNOH, we have a system to ensure any new posts are banded appropriately and we regularly review current bandings to ensure that these remain appropriate over time.  Other Equality & Diversity data  We are committed to sharing equalities data and will, over time, add new reports which reflect the diversity of our patients and staff. Through publishing this data, we aim to demonstrate how we have due regard to meeting the aims of the Equality Duty:   to eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited under the Equality Act 2010  to advance equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not  to foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not   If you wish to comment on any of the equalities data provided on this site, please email Communications.Dept@rnoh.nhs.uk.
