We value the diversity within our communities and believe that everyone should be treated fairly and with respect.  Northwards plays an active role in promoting equality and challenging discrimination in all its forms. We believe that everyone has the right to be themselves and to live their lives free from harassment and abuse.  We involve our tenants in shaping and developing our services. This helps us to ensure that our services are of a high standard, and that they are tailored to meet the needs of all our customers.  Northwards is an equal opportunities employer. We aim to be representative of the area we serve, and we promote employment and training opportunities to local people and under-represented groups. We regularly monitor and review our recruitment and employment practices to ensure that they do not discriminate, and that they are fair and accessible to everyone.  We welcome applications from people with disabilities and offer all disabled applicants who have met the minimum criteria a place on our guaranteed interview scheme. We also provide reasonable adjustments as part of the interview and selection process.  Where possible we are keen to recruit from within our local communities, and we encourage applications from people who may have been out of work for long periods of time. We will, for example, consider applications from those who have previously left work to start a family or those who may have had an addiction, long term health problem, or a previous criminal conviction. We would consider each application on its own merits against the suitability for the job role.  Northwards believe that everyone should have the opportunity to reach their potential, and we are committed to supporting our all our employees to become the very best they can be.
