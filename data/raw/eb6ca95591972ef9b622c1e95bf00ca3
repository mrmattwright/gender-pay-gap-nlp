Gender Pay

Reporting Statement

Context 
From April 2017, all organisations that employ over 
250 employees are required to report their gender 
pay gap data annually, showing the diﬀerences in 
the average earnings of men and women over a 
standard time period, regardless of their role 
seniority. The statistics used in this document 
show the proﬁle of the workforce at Harlow College 
as of 31st March 2017.
 
We have adopted an approach to Staﬀ Pay that 
ensures the fair treatment and reward of staﬀ, 
irrespective of their gender. 

In terms of our gender proﬁle, the workforce 
consists of signiﬁcantly more women than men 
(63% women and 37% men). This is a typical proﬁle 
in many Further Education Colleges. Our gender 
pay results should therefore be considered in the 
context of this distribution, as the predominance of 
women to men has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on our 
overall gender pay gaps.

 
Our Pay Structure
Historically Harlow College has used the pay scales 
recommended by the Association of Colleges, 
which consists of a single spinal structure, divided 
into grades.

Our commitment and
aims on pay equality 

as much as possible. We are pleased to see that 
this has resulted in a relatively low mean pay gap, 
but we recognise that there is further work to be 
done to reduce the gender pay gap. 

The College has a higher proportion of women in 
the Upper Middle, Lower Middle and Lower 
Quartiles and we are pleased to be able to say that 
Harlow College’s pay gap compares favourably with 
that of other organisations in the sector and the UK. 

According to the Annual Survey of Hours and 
Earnings (source: Oﬃce of National Statistics), in 
which the gender pay gap is calculated as the 
diﬀerence between average hourly earnings of 
men and women as a proportion of average hourly 
earnings of men’s earnings, the pay gap for all 
employees is recorded as 18.4% in 2017.

It is important to note that a contributing factor in 
this proﬁle is that many of our roles are 
undertaken on a ﬂexible work basis. Diﬀerent work 
arrangements include, term time working, 
condensed hours, fractional hours, diﬀerent daily 
hours or working patterns.

Eradicating the Gender Pay Gap
Whilst we are pleased with what the ﬁgures show, 
the College is not complacent. We intend to 
continue to actively monitor pay and to take any 
targeted action where necessary and appropriate. 
We will also review our recruitment process, with
a focus on how to attract women into any male 
dominated roles in the College, such as 
Engineering and Construction.

The College is committed to addressing workplace 
barriers to equality and providing all employee’s 
with equality of opportunity. Prior to this 
legislation coming into force, the College examined 
its pay structure and has actively looked at what 
measures it can take to narrow its gender pay gap

Bonus Pay

In the relevant pay period, the College did not pay a bonus. The proportion of women and men who were 
paid bonus pay was therefore 0% for both. Accordingly, there is no mean or median diﬀerence in bonus pay 
to report.
