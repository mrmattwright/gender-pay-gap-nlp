The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean/median) earnings of men and women.  Healthcare Locums Limited, trading as HCL Workforce Solutions is a leading provider of temporary and permanent health and social care professionals to the public and private sectors.  Working in partnership with clients we place more than 2,000 fully compliant professionals every week.  HCL is split across various sectors, for the purpose of the gender pay gap reporting we are focusing on Doctors, Healthcare, Nursing and Social Care.  HCL’s work force consists of more females than males which is typical of the Healthcare sector       Gender  Percentage    Female  64%    Male  36%        Gender Pay Reporting  The following results, in line with mandatory requirements, have been calculated as of April 2017.     Median GPG    13.18%        Median Bonus GPG    0.00%        Mean GPG    7.22%        Mean Bonus GPG    0.00%            Quartile Bands  Lower Quartile  Lower Middle Quartile  Upper Middle Quartile  Upper Quartile    Female  68.75%  71.25%  70.00%  47.50%    Male  31.25%  28.75%  30.00%  52.50%      HCL’s overall median gender pay gap is 13.18% which is better than the ONS (Office of National Statistics) estimated national average of 18.4%. In regards to the proportions of males and females by pay quartile HCL reports a difference of 5% in the upper quartile only. Our results are in line with the ONS in that nearly 90% of part time positions in the health industry are female. This would help explain the high number of females accounted for in the lower quartiles. Objectives Continue to encourage diversity and support in all areas of the business. The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies and used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. I, Jamie Webb, Group CFO, HCL Workforce Solutions, confirm the information in this statement is accurate.
