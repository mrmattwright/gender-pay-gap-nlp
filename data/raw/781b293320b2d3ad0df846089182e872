It’s important to note that it’s not the same as the requirement to pay men and women equal pay for equal work. We’re confident we pay men and women equally for doing like for like work. Like most organisations, we recognise that we do have a gender pay gap at 5 April 2017.  We also recognise that due to the seasonal nature of our operation, we have a volatile workforce profile which hugely affects our figures.  For example, we have run the figures for 1 June 2017 when we are at our highest employment, and our median gap falls from 16.3% to 5.35%.  At 5 January, when our workforce is at its smallest, then it falls even further to 0.07%.  We’re pleased that even as at 5 April 2017 our Gender Pay Gap is still below the national average published by the Office of National Statistics as at the time of reporting, however, we believe that this is a great opportunity for us to talk about what we’re already doing and what more we can do to make every role at Glyndebourne as attractive to as many people as possible.  ​Gender Pay Gap Report   05/04/2017  01/06/17  05/01/18  Mean Gender Pay Gap   12.5%  11.38%  11.32%  Median Gender Pay Gap   16.3%  5.35%  0.07%  Mean Bonus Gap   7.3%    Median Bonus Gap   14.8%    Bonus Proportion  Male  71.3%     Female  68.0%    Quartile Pay Bands  Lower Quartile  Male  37.0%  Out of 65 employees in the lower quartile, 24 were male and 41 were female   Female  63.0%   Lower Middle  Male  42.2%  Out of 64 employees in the lower middle quartile, 27 were male and 37 were female   Female  57.8%   Upper Middle  Male  43.7%  Out of 64 employees in the upper middle quartile, 28 were male and 36 were female   Female  56.3%   Upper  Male  54.7%  Out of 64 employees in the upper quartile, 35 were male and 29 were female   Female  45.3%            Introduction to Glyndebourne    Our history    Our Archive    The Glyndebourne Opera Cup    Our resident orchestras and chorus    Glyndebourne and the environment    Economic Impact Report    Gender Pay Gap reporting    Annual reports    Contact information             Help support our work  Donate      Search       Search          Productions for hire  Ticket information  Returns Club  Work at Glyndebourne  Dining  Our Archive  Press Office  Credits  Company information  Contact us  Community guidelines  Privacy notice  Cookie policy  Terms and conditions     Glyndebourne  Lewes, East Sussex, BN8 5UU  Box Office: +44(0)1273 815000        Join Us    Twitter    Facebook    Instagram    YouTube         Achievement in Opera, UK Theatre Awards 2015 Outstanding Contribution to the UK Opera Scene 2015, What's On Stage  © 2018 Glyndebourne    en  fr  de
