Gender Pay Gap report 2017
Kettle Foods Ltd.

When  KETTLE®  Chips  were  first  launched 
back  in  1982  the  ethos  was  fundamentally 
about  quality  potatoes  sourced  in  the  least 
harmful way to the environment.  

Today  nothing  has  changed.    At  Kettle 
Foods  we  believe    in  doing  things  in  the 
right way for the right reasons.  Our mission 
is to produce the very best possible snacks 
whilst being mindful of our environment, our  
people and our local community.

We’re proud to have a diverse team in terms 
of gender, ethnicity and perspective and we 
believe this gives Kettle Foods a wonderfully 
rich experience and is the key to our success.

That,  and,  of  course,  the  fact  that  our  
products  are made with our commitment to 
making snacking better. 

Our  flagship  brand  KETTLE®  Chips  are 
made from largely locally sourced potatoes 
in beautiful Norfolk, using the best sunflower 
oil to cook them. Then they’re tumbled with 
authentic  seasonings,  including  only  real 
food ingredients.

It’s  not  just  crisps  we’re  making  better;  
Metcalfe’s skinny popcorn has removed over 
14 tonnes of sugar from the nation’s diet by 
formulating its delicious stevia blend.

We invest in our people and remain 
committed  to  providing  stable    
employment  and  opportunities 
for all of our employees.  

We  have  always  followed  a  principle  of         
remunerating our people fairly and equitably 
regardless of gender.

Our Pay Gap

Our  team 
is  made  up  of  70%  males. 
42%  of  our  senior  managers  are  female. 
The  mean  pay  gap  is  7.8%  compared  to 
the  UK  average  of  18%.    On  virtually  all  
measures Kettle Foods is significantly better 
than the national average.
 

Indeed,  we  are  proud  that  our        
median bonus pay gap is zero.

We are also            
incredibly proud that 
our Executive Team is made up 
of 3 men and 3 women, giving us a rich blend 
of healthy debate and diverse views.
  
Approximately a third of each of our grades 
are female with the exception of Technical, 
Operations, 
IT  and  Engineering  areas.  
Marketing,  Legal  and  HR,  meanwhile,  are 
largely female.

All  our  operatives  are  paid  the  same  basic 
salary.  Additional  allowances  are  paid  to  
reflect skills and shifts worked.  

The average pay reflects that there are more 
longer  serving  males  who  have  acquired  
additional skills payments over time.

The  distribution  of  men  and  women  in 
quartiles  is  reflective  of  the  nature  of  the 
work  where  men  are  disproportionately 
represented at all levels of the organisation.  

Where  men  and  women  perform  the  same 
roles  they  are  typically  paid  the  same 
rates of pay or paid within a defined range 
depending on experience.

The gender bonus pay gap reflects the fact 
that the highest paid male skews the figures 
whilst at median there is no bonus pay gap 
at all.

There are also more females in Administrative 
functions as compared to Technical functions.  

Overall Kettle foods have a flat pay structure 
based  on  local  market  rates.    Additional 
payments  are  broadly  based  on  skill 
acquisition.  

The  bias  towards  males  in  traditional  areas 
such  as  the  Engineering,  IT  and  Technical 
areas  is  being  addressed  through  training 
and in time, we would expect more women 
to move into these technical roles.

The  management  team  recognises 
that continuing to attract a diverse 
workforce is critical for our future 
success. 

We continue to encourage all employees to 
gain  additional  skills  to  progress  within  the 
organisation.  

To  aid  this,  professional  and  vocational 
training  are  offered  as  part  of  the  broader 
employment proposition.

Kettle  Foods  has  a  long  serving 
work  force  with  vacancies  highly 
sought after in the markets local to 
our facilities.  

People  are  attracted  to  the  fact  that  the 
overall  remuneration  package  is  attractive 
compared to other manufacturing companies 
in the locale. 

All  employees  enjoy  benefits  including  a 
generous company contribution to pension, 
company  bonus,  company  sick  pay,  life 
assurance,  private  medical  care  provision, 
and a generous annual leave allowance.
