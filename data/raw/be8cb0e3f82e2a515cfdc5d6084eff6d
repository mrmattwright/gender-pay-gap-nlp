Gender Pay Gap Reporting Statement 2017  
 
Hard Rock International – (Hard Rock Cafe London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Glasgow and Hard 
Rock International Corporate Team) 
 
We are an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulation 2017. 
 
As an employer with a workforce of more than 250 plus in the UK on the 5th April 2017, we must 
comply with new statutory provisions regarding gender pay reporting.  This involves carrying out six 
calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our 
organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employee’s data. 
 
We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website and will do 
this within one calendar year of 5th April 2017 using our HR and payroll data.
