This information was based on a snapshot date of 5 th April 2017 and calculated in accordance with Government guidelines.  The bonus measure takes into account the twelve months to this date.  At Cooplands, we pay the same rate of pay for the same job, irrespective of race or gender. Our company structure is split between manufacture and retail, the majority of our staff being employed in retail.  This structure is responsible for the gender pay gap figures reported below. The majority of manufacturing jobs are full-time posts mainly held by male employees. A large proportion of retail staff hold part-time positions and are predominantly held by female employees. This is not as a result of our recruitment policy, but a reflection of the mix of application numbers.
