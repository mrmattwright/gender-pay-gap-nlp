This requires us to report on a number of metrics, (6 calculations) as of 31 March each year, that show the gender pay gap difference between the average earnings of men and women (expressed as both the mean and median), shown as a percentage of men’s earnings. Gender pay gap is different to and should not be confused with equal pay. The data published does not involve publishing individual employees data. The metrics The Metrics are based on hourly earnings as of 31 March 2017, on a staff base of 2,462 staff (core and hourly paid) (56% female and 44 % male). Hourly rate Mean and median based on an hourly rate of ordinary pay i.e. full earnings distribution:  Mean gender pay gap Median gender pay gap Total Men £22.38 £21.57 1,092 Women £20.31 £19.96 1,370 Gap % 9.25% 7.46%  Bonus pay Mean and median bonus gender pay gap and the proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment:  Mean gender bonus gap Median gender bonus gap Proportion receiving bonus Men 7.04% 4.66% 9.52% Women 10.07% Quartile pay band The proportion of male and female employees in each quartile pay band, showing the spread of male and female earners across the University: Pay band Number of men Percentage of men Number of women Percentage of women Quarter 1 239 38.86% 376 61.14% Quarter 2 238 38.64% 378 61.36% Quarter 3 283 46.02% 332 53.98% Quarter 4 332 53.90% 284 46.10% The above data has been reported to the University’s VCE group and to its Board of Governors, it will also be reported on the Government’s Gender pay website . Gender Pay Gap reporting will be monitored and reviewed by the University’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee, whose membership consists of the four equality fora groups, including gender. This will enable greater transparency about gender pay differences between men and women both within the University and externally. It also fits within our Equality and Diversity agenda, which is a key objective within the People and Culture Enabling Plan.
