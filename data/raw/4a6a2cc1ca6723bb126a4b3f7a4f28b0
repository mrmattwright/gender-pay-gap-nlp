By law, men and women must receive equal pay for:  • the same or broadly similar work;  • work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or  • work of equal value.   Hope House Children’s Hospices is required by law to publish an annual gender pay gap report.  The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 came into force on 6 th April 2017, requiring all voluntary and private-sector employers with 250 or more employees to publish information about their gender pay gap results. Definition:  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.   Results  Based on the snapshot date of 5th April 2017:  The mean gender pay gap for Hope House Children’s Hospices is 0.3%  The median gender pay gap for Hope House Children’s Hospices is -3.5%  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band of Hope House Children’s Hospices is: Pay quartiles by gender                                                                                    Table 1    Band  Males  Females  Description     A  12.7%  87.3%  Includes all   employees whose standard hourly rate places them at or below the lower   quartile    B  12.7%  87.3%  Includes all   employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the lower quartile but   at or below the median    C  12.7%  87.3%  Includes all   employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the median but at or   below the upper quartile    D  9.5%  90.5%  Includes all   employees whose standard hourly rate places them above the upper quartile     The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  The Regulations also set out calculations required in relation to the payment of bonuses, Hope House Children’s Hospices do not pay any form of bonus to employees and therefore this is not provided. Mean Pay  The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17.5%.  At 0.3%, Hope House Children’s Hospices mean gender pay gap is significantly lower than that for the whole economy and does not present any concerns. Median Pay  The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 ONS ASHE figures) is 19.2%.  At -3.5%, Hope House Children’s Hospices results show a negligible median gender pay gap in favour of women, but at this level does not cause concern. Pay Quartiles  Table 1 above shows pay quartiles by gender. This shows Hope House Children’s Hospice’s workforce divided into four equal-sized groups based on hourly pay rates, with Band A including the lowest-paid 25% of employees (the lower quartile) and Band D covering the highest-paid 25% (the upper quartile).  The results show that despite the UK trend that men are more likely to be employed in more senior roles than women, this is not the case at Hope House Children’s Hospices with the ratio of males to females in all four quartiles of the organisation evenly spread. The table also shows that we have significantly more female employees than male.  The number of men in the nursing and care sector remains very low, according to the Nursing & Midwifery Council in 2016 11.4% of registered nurses in the UK were male an increase of 0.4% from 5 years earlier.  The proportion of male nursing students in the UK hasn’t shifted either in the last decade. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency in 2016 it stood at 11.6% compared with 11.5% a decade earlier. Conclusion  Taken together the findings show that a gender pay gap as defined by the Equality Act does not exist at Hope House Children’s Hospices.  The marginal difference between the median pay for men and women (in favour of women) arises from the roles in which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract. Hope House Children’s Hospices is therefore confident that any marginal gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Ensuring Equality  Hope House Children’s Hospices is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). As such, we;  •  Regularly review pay and benefits;  •  evaluate job roles and pay grades to ensure a fair structure. Given the findings of this assessment, there are no plans to make any changes to the way in which our employees are recruited or remunerated. We will undertake an annual reassessment to ensure continued equity and compliance.    I, Andrew Goldsmith, Chief Executive, confirm that the information in this statement is accurate. Signed: A.
