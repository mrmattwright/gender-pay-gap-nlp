At Bexley we have established pay and grading systems underpinned by job evaluation schemes to ensure that men and women doing work of equal value are paid at the same pay grade. However, like most employers that doesn’t prevent a Gender Pay Gap.  Our Gender Pay Gap specifically relates to the proportion of men and women employed at each level of the organisation.  We recognise that we need to do further work to explore the detailed reasons for this. This work will then support our continued development of strategies promoting employment opportunities and career progression for all.  Gill Steward Chief Executive                           Background      Gender Pay Gap legislation introduced in April 2017 requires all employers of 250 or more employees to publish information about Gender Pay Gaps by 31 March 2018. This information is based on a snapshot of pay on 31 March 2017. Employers are required to publish data based on a specific set of formula as set out in the guidance to the legislation.  Employers are required to calculate and publish the following gender pay data:  Mean Gender Pay Gap - the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.  Median Gender Pay Gap - the difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees.  Mean Bonus Gap - the difference between the mean bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female relevant employees.  Median Bonus Gap - the difference between the median bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female relevant employees.  Bonus Proportions - the proportions of male and female relevant employees who were paid bonus pay during the relevant period.  Quartile Pay Bands – the proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower, lower middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands.  This report reflects the Council’s Gender Pay Gap as at 31 March 2017.        Equal Pay and the Gender Pay Gap      Equal Pay legislation has been in force since 1970 and requires employers to ensure that there is no difference between pay for men and women doing the same job or work of equal value. The Gender Pay Gap differentiates in that it is a measure of disparity in pay between the average earnings of men and women. Because the gender pay gap is a comparison of average pay rates of all eligible employees this will be affected by the proportion of men and women employed at each pay rate.        Pay and reward in the London Borough of Bexley      The Council operates a pay and grading structure underpinned by job evaluation schemes aimed at ensuring that there is no gender bias in the grading of posts.  Each grade has a number of incremental points. Progression through the grade is subject to annual performance review.  In addition the Council operates a performance related bonus scheme which provides for bonuses of 5% to be paid for exceptional performance. For the year ending 31 March 2017 the Council also paid a recruitment and retention bonus to relevant staff employed in Children’s Social Care.        Gender Pay Gap reporting      This is the first year of publication of the Council’s Gender Pay Gap and represents the position as at 31 March 2017. At that time the number of eligible employees for Gender Pay Gap reporting (by headcount) was a total of 2046 of which 1570 were women and 476 men.  Gender Pay Gap reporting  Pay rates  Gender Pay Gap  Mean hourly rate  7.9%  Median hourly rate  9.9%  Pay Quartile information  Pay quartiles  Women  Men  Total  Proportion of women and men in the upper quartile (paid above the 75th percentile point)  73%  27%  100%  Proportion of women and men in the upper middle quartile (paid above the median and at or below the 75th percentile point)  75%  25%  100%  Proportion of women and men in the lower middle quartile (paid above the 25th percentile point and at or below the median)  80%  20%  100%  Proportion of women and men in the lower quartile (paid below the 25th percentile point)  79%  21%  100%  Bonus pay  Bonus Gender Pay Gap  Mean bonus  20.9%  Median bonus  19.6%  Bonuses paid  Women paid bonus as % of all women  10%  Men paid bonus as % of all men          The Gender Pay Gap      The Gender Pay Gap between men and women is 7.9% based on the mean hourly rate and 9.9% based on the median hourly rate. This is the pay gap across all grades and pay rates and means that on average, women are paid 7.9% less per hour than men.  The reason for the differential is that there is not an even distribution of genders across pay rates.  Proportionally more women are employed in the lower middle quartile and lower quartile (80% and 79% respectively) compared to the upper middle quartile and upper quartile (75% and 73% respectively).        The Bonus Pay Gap      The Bonus Gender Pay Gap is 20.9%. This means that the average bonus paid to women divided by the total number of all eligible female employees is 20.9% lower than that paid to men. This is as a result of 11% of men receiving a bonus compared to 10% of women and a higher proportion of men than women (15% of men compared to 13% of women) in the upper two pay quartiles receiving a bonus (with bonuses being based on a fixed percentage of basic pay).  Further analysis of bonus pay shows that when taking the average bonus payment made to men and women divided by the total number of men and women actually receiving a bonus the gap reduces to 11%.        Work on eradicating the Gender Pay Gap      This is the first year of reporting of the Gender Pay Gap in this format. Our pay gap stems from the fact that there is not an even distribution of men and women across all pay rates. For the pay gap to be eradicated there would need to be an even distribution of men and women across all pay rates.  Over the last 5 years there has been an increase in the proportion of women employed in senior management grades within the eligible employees covered by this report. This has risen from 42% in in 2012 to 51% in 2017.  Where there is uneven representation within our workforce across grades, pay rates and occupational groups we will undertake further work to establish the reasons for this and develop strategies to improve the balance. This will include our strategies for recruitment, retention and career development and progression.  We already operate a number of flexible working schemes that encourage all staff to strike the right work-life balance but also enable those in particular with caring responsibilities to join and remain with us. We will continue to develop these and other schemes in consultation with our staff and their representatives.
