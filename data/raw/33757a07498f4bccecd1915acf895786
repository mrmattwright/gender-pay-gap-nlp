Every day millions of people across the UK rely on the services we provide.  We are a leading provider of integrated healthcare services to the NHS and our family of businesses stretch right across the sector. We operate over 1,500 community pharmacies through our LloydsPharmacy brand and we also deliver medicine to every dispensing point in the UK through our wholesale distributor AAH Pharmaceuticals.  As well as LloydsPharmacy and AAH, Celesio UK comprises of LloydsPharmacy Clinical Homecare, Online Doctor, Betterlife, John Bell and Croyden and MASTA.  Our business is made up of 24,130 employees, with 17,990 females and 6,140 males. We pride ourselves on being a workforce that reflects the people and communities we serve.  Our commitment to ensuring equal opportunities stretches right throughout our organisation. At the time of our data sampling (April 2017), the Celesio UK country board consisted of a 50/50 split of three females and three males. The previous year the country board was 100% male, demonstrating that we’ve made progress even at our most senior level.  We believe that having a strong diverse workforce at every level, means we are better prepared to meet our customers’ and patients’ needs.  We are guided by our ICARE values, which mean that we always strive to do the right thing, in the right way. Transparency and equality are part of our DNA and therefore reporting on gender pay gap is an important step forward.  The differences identified in this report show that there is still some work to be done to make our pay as fair as possible and we are committed to bridging the gaps over the next few years.  This report is broken down into four of our business units which employ over 250 people – LloydsPharmacy, AAH Pharmaceuticals, Barclay Pharmaceuticals (part of the AAH family) and LloydsPharmacy Clinical Homecare.
