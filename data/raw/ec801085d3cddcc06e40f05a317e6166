The retail sector retail can offer a number of flexible working opportunities which may suit  certain individuals in 
differing ways. Whilst conducting the Gender Pay analysis,  the Company found no evidence of where any pay or 
bonus was paid proportionately higher to any male employee; even discovering that bonus pay was higher in female 
employees. Analysis further confirmed that bonus pay is awarded on objective achievements only and the number of 
female employees in Management roles in our stores, is higher than male employees.
