The Hills Group

Gender Pay Gap Report

£££

In accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information)

Regulations 2017 The Hills Group is publishing gender pay gap data for Hills

Waste Solutions Limited which employed more than 250 employees on the

reporting reference date of 5 April 2017. 

In addition, The Hills Group is voluntarily publishing gender pay gap data calculated on the same basis for
all employees within The Hills Group of companies to demonstrate our commitment to promoting equality
and better transparency of gender pay within the workplace.

Across our operations and support functions men and women are paid equally for

doing equivalent jobs. Any differentials shown in our published gender pay data is not

reflective of equal pay issues within the business but is attributable to the makeup

and structure of our workforce. 

The industries in which The Hills Group of companies operate, (waste and recycling, quarrying and house
building), employ a high proportion of male workers with 83% of male employees making up our total
workforce and this increasing to 88% in Hills Waste Solutions.

The majority of our male workforce is employed in front line operational roles, whereas the majority of our
female workforce is employed in support functions.  This, combined with the relatively low proportion of
female employees in the overall workforce, explains the negative median gender pay and bonus pay gap
within Hills Waste Solutions where median female pay and bonus pay is greater than for the male workforce.

The Hills Group operates two separate discretionary bonus schemes for employees based on grades.  All
employees are eligible to participate in one or other of the schemes with both subject to minimum service
and performance eligibility criteria.  The difference between the proportions of male and female employees
receiving a bonus payment is attributable to qualification under the eligibility criteria.  Across The Hills Group
a higher proportion of male employees hold management grade positions and explains the positive mean
and median gender bonus pay gap for The Hills Group.
