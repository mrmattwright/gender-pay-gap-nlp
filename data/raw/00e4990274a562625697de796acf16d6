Since then, we’ve grown exponentially and with a global team around 600 strong, have become a market-leading, multi-award winning, bank-beating, rapidly-growing, fun-loving international payments company.  People are at the heart of everything we do. Our business is built on relationships with our clients, suppliers, and partners. And we’re inspired to make our customers’ lives just a little bit better each day by helping them to move their money around the world, brilliantly. But what’s the real secret behind our continued success? Hands down, we’re powered by the dynamic and passionate WorldFirst family.  People First  At WorldFirst, we particularly value the following behaviours, which means that we look for examples of these when we hire, promote and reward WorldFirsters.
