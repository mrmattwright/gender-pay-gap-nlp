An Inclusive and Diverse 
Company

Inclusive Leadership, Supporting Diversity and Workplace Respect are our core values. We drive a 
high-performance culture where all employees have every opportunity to succeed and grow.

Honeywell is a diverse group of businesses, operating for many years in the science, technology, 
and engineering fields. Because these are predominantly male-dominated professions, we work 
hard to support all our people – regardless of gender or background – to be their best and to 
create rewarding, long-term careers at all levels within the company. 

The following are key elements of this commitment:

BRID WHELEHAN, 
Team Leader: 
“I’ve always been part of diverse 
technology and engineering 
teams and I enjoy the work I do. 
I would like to see more women 
pursuing careers in technology 
and engineering. We need to 
encourage girls while still at 
school to help them realise they 
have the potential to go far in 
the technology, science and 
engineering industries.”

Coaching and Mentoring
•  On a global level, we 

STEM Education
•  Our Honeywell 

Educators at Space

students in the UK. 

•  Each year these

opportunity to visit the

and interactive flight 
dynamics programmes.

SARAH MARTIN,  
Product Marketing 
Director: 
“Engineering can offer 
challenging, varied 
and rewarding career 
opportunities for all, 
regardless of gender. It 
is therefore vital that the 
engineering industry works 
hard to ensure women’s 
voices are heard, because 
diverse populations 
bring diverse ideas that 
drive growth.”

Gender Pay Gap Reporting

With the goal of promoting greater gender diversity, the UK Government is requiring all 
employers with 250 or more employees to disclose their gender pay gap on an annual basis.

What is a Pay Gap?

Shows aggregated data about 
all jobs at all levels to reveal 
any overall differences in 
compensation between men 
and women.

Not an indication of pay 
inequality since the men and 
women may be in different roles. 
Nevertheless, this is something 
Honeywell takes very seriously.

What is Equal Pay?

Compares pay for men and 
women performing the same 
or equivalent jobs.

Reflects possible 
discrimination in pay if the 
men and women are being 
compensated differently for 
the same work.

•  Mean is the same thing as average: the sum of 
all values divided by the total number of values.

Median

•  Median is the middle point of the data set: 
half the values will be less than the median, 
and half will be above.

SARAH WALLIS,  
Site Leader: 
“Engineering teaches you how to solve problems. I have always been curious about how 
things worked, and in my career I have had the privilege to work alongside really smart 
people, learn new things and continually push myself. Engineering, like many other 
industries, must be committed to providing greater support and flexibility for women. If we 
can be more creative in how we approach this, we can encourage more women into careers 
that provide them these kinds of opportunities.”

Honeywell UK Gender Pay Gap

We see the UK Government’s Gender Pay Gap legislation as a positive step, highlighting an 
important issue that businesses need to pay close attention to and improve on. At Honeywell, 
we are committed to this through a range of initiatives that encourage women to join our 
company, and support them in creating successful and rewarding careers with us. This is just 
one element of our steadfast approach to maintaining a fully inclusive and diverse organisation 
– two workplace characteristics that are integral to the way Honeywell operates.

Gender Pay Gap Statutory 
Reporting

While we have opted to publish our gender pay gap across all Honeywell UK businesses, we are 
required by UK law to only report the individual pay gap figures for each UK legal entity with 
more than 250 employees.

The following data tables reflect five Honeywell UK legal entities that are required to report their 
individual pay gap figures in line with this regulation. Together these legal entities account for 
more than half (3,473) of Honeywell’s UK employees:
