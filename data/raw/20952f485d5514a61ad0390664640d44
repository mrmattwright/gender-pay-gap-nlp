Our pay strategy 

Gender balance 

We believe that a sustainable and successful business 
relies on a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects 
the customers it serves and the communities in which it 
operates. Gender balance is crucial to this. 

Our reported pay gap is driven by a number of structural 
issues in our workforce.

(GCB0-3) 

Our pay strategy is designed to attract and motivate the 
very best people, regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, 
disability or any other factor unrelated to performance or 
experience.

We review market pay benchmarks based on grade, job, 
business and geography – this helps us to understand 
pay differences, if any, for similar roles. Our analysis 
shows that, in the UK, men and women are paid broadly 
comparable rates to market.  

We are confident in our approach to pay and if we 
identify any pay differences between men and women in 
similar roles, which cannot be explained by reasons such 
as performance/behaviour rating or experience, we 
make appropriate adjustments. 

Distinct from the concept of equal pay, the required UK 
Gender Pay Gap reporting shows the difference between 
the average earnings of all the men and all the women in 
an organisation.

For 2017, HSBC’s largest legal entity in the UK, HSBC 
Bank Plc, has a 29% median pay gap and a 59% mean 
pay gap. We have also decided to publish early for 2018 
and as at 1 February the figures are 29% and 60% 
respectively.

Structural issues: 

  Fewer women in senior leadership (GCB0-3) and 
the associated higher levels of pay: Whilst female 
employees account for 54% of HSBC’s overall 
workforce in the UK, 23% of our senior leadership 
positions are currently held by women 

  Gender imbalance in junior (GCB6-8) roles: Two-

thirds of our UK employees in junior roles are 
female. The under-representation of male 
employees at this level is also where the market pay 
rates are relatively lower 

  Higher proportion of female employees on part-

time hours: Employees who work part-time receive 
their bonuses on a ‘pro rata’ basis, but the 
calculation for the gender bonus gap does not allow 
any adjustment to bring these bonuses back to their 
‘full-time equivalent’ level. While we encourage both 
men and women to work flexibly, the majority of 
those currently doing so are women 

Whilst these issues are a challenge for our industry, 
there are additional factors which affect our calculation. 
Many of our senior global roles are based in the UK as 
this is the location for Group head office. Additionally, as 
a universal bank, some UK entities contain a wide range 
of businesses from investment banking to retail banking. 
Where a legal entity has similar roles within the business 
(e.g. Marks & Spencer Financial Services), our median 
pay gap is 2%.

There are a number of specific steps we are taking to improve 
our gender balance which we expect will positively impact our 
gender pay gap in the UK over time, including: 

1.  Driving better gender balance at all levels in the 

organisation 

  Our Group Chief Executive John Flint has signed up to 
the 30% Club campaign with an aspirational target for 
30% of senior leadership roles to be filled by women 
by 2020. Objectives aligned to this goal are included in 
senior leader performance scorecards 

  An Inclusive Leadership objective is included in the 

performance scorecards of our HSBC UK people 
managers   

  HSBC will request gender diverse shortlists for all 

external senior leadership hires  

  A new inclusive Hiring Essentials course is being made 

available to hiring managers across HSBC in 2018 as 
part of our People Management Essentials programme 
in our recently launched HSBC University 

2.  Developing female talent to strengthen the

leadership pipeline 

 
HSBC and gender diversity 
At the Group level, the share of women on HSBC’s board is 
29.4%.  

Our overall share of women in global senior leadership roles 
has increased year-on-year over the past five years and was 
26.8% at the end of 2017.  

In 2017, HSBC featured in The Times Top 50 Employers for 
Women list for the third year running in the UK.  

While we are proud to receive this recognition, we recognise 
that that there is more work to do to address our gender 
balance at senior levels. HSBC UK was one of the first 
signatories to the HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter to 
demonstrate our ongoing commitment.

  We continue to drive a gender-balanced intake of 

graduate talent in the UK  

  We ensure balanced representation in HSBC's talent 

development programmes for high potential employees 

  We are working in partnership with external 

organisations in the UK to support the progress of our 
talented women through a number of programmes 

  We have expanded opportunities for talented women 
in Global Banking and Markets to access sponsorship 
and mentoring to support their career ambitions, 
including programmes aimed at Director level 

3.  Supporting families, flexibility and retaining 

female talent 

  Parental leave coaching is available for new parents 

and their managers in the UK 

  We promote shared parental leave and sabbatical 

policies to help employees manage their lives outside 
of work 

  Many of our employees are already working flexibly in 
some way. A new Flex employee network has recently 
launched in the UK, and we are working together to 
identify opportunities to enhance our flexible working 
proposition 

Additional activity in support of our gender diversity goals is also 
taking place in individual business areas and through our UK 
employee networks, including our award-winning Balance 
network. We are also focused on improving pay transparency 
and consistency for our junior employees and have already 
made changes for 2018.

In conclusion  

 

Improving the gender balance across businesses and levels of 
seniority is a priority and something to which the Group 
Management Board is committed. We are making progress. 
Improving our gender balance will take time and require 
sustained focus over the long-term.

2.  Gender bonus gap (males vs females) 

The gender bonus gap is the difference (mean and median) between the bonus paid to male relevant employees and 
that paid to female relevant employees over the ‘relevant bonus period’. This is expressed as a percentage of the 

bonus paid to male relevant employees. The ‘relevant bonus period’ is the period of 12 months ending with 05 April 

2017 (for 2017) and 01 February 2018 (for 2018).  

Employees who work part-time receive their bonuses on a ‘pro rata’ basis, but the calculation for the gender bonus gap 
does not allow any adjustment to bring these bonuses back to their ‘full time equivalent’ level.

4.  The percentage of males and females in each quartile of the pay distribution 

This information reflects the proportion of male and female relevant employees in four quartile pay bands i.e. lower 
(Q1), lower middle (Q2), upper middle (Q3) and upper quartile (Q4). The quartile bands are established by ranking all 

relevant employees (male and female) from the lowest hourly rate of pay to the highest hourly pay rate of pay and 
dividing the entire workforce into four equal parts. Once the quartiles have been defined, the proportion of male and 

female employees in each quartile band is calculated as a percentage of the relevant employees in that pay band.
