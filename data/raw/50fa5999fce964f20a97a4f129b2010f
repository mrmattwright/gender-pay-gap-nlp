 

This report looks at the profile of employees and at human resources 
management activities over financial year 2016–17 

It covers all departments of the council and directly employed substantive 
employees.  It therefore excludes those under the management of schools. 

All departmental details will relate to organisational structures as at year end 
2016-17. 

All workforce profile data will be at the end of the year 2016-17. 

All data related to the outcomes of HR activity will cover the period April 2016 
– March 2017, unless stated. 

For completeness, information is given on the numbers of agency workers 
engaged.  They are an important addition to our workforce resources but do 
not have a direct contractual relationship with the council and therefore 
details are limited. 

The data used in this report is rounded up or down. It is for this reason that, 
on occasions, tables may not add up to 100%. .

The report –  
 
1.  

Begins with key data.  This includes an overview of employees’ profile and 
some comparative data from previous years. 

Looks  at  the  profile  of  the  council’s  employees  against  each  protected 
characteristic  where  information  is  available  (gender,  ethnic  origin,  age, 
disability).   

Will, for the first time, include gender pay gap data as set out in legislation. 
Previous  reports  have  included  gender  data,  but  new  requirements  include 
specified formulas. 

4.   Will be discussed with the constituent trade unions. 
 
The  report  will  be  published  on  the  council’s  intranet,  (the  Source),  and  the 
Southwark website; www.southwark.gov.uk

Section 1: Workforce Numbers & Employee Profiles  
 
 
1. 

The headcount of employees was 4,150.  This excludes casual workers and 
others who are not directly employed such as agency workers.  A workforce 
population of 4150 is a reduction of 8.6% of employee numbers in 2015-16. 
(Key Data).   
 
Southwark has a similar size workforce to boroughs such as Islington, Tower 
Hamlets, Camden and Hackney who have similarly retained key services in-
house  rather  than  outsourcing.  The  average  size  of  London  boroughs  for 
2016/17 was 2,666.and 3,119 for inner London boroughs. 
 
Employees  in  the  three  service  departments  make  up  83%  of the  council’s 
workforce  (Children’s  &  Adults;  Environment  &  Leisure;  Housing  & 
Modernisation). (Reference data 1)  
 
The  highest  percentage  of  part  time  employees  is  in  Children’s  &  Adults’ 
Services (17%).  Overall 13% of all employees work part time.  (Reference

The  percentages  of  female  and  male  employees  are  similar;  51%  of 
employees are female; 49% are male. (Reference data 3).  The gender split 
shows a small change (1%) from the previous year, (Key Data). The gender 
breakdown  in  council  employment  is  similar  to  the  female  population  in 
Southwark  (50.5%)  and  is  slightly  lower  than  the  average  across  London 
boroughs (58%). (Appendix 1) 
 
There  are  greater  differences  in  the  gender  breakdown  when  looking  at  a 
departmental level.  (Reference data 3). In particular, Environment has a high 
percentage of male staff compared to the rest of the Council largely due to 
areas such as waste and cleansing and traded/building services. 
 
There are higher percentages of male employees than female employees in 
the  grades  1-5,  amongst  building  workers  and  in  the  higher  grade  bands, 
although the total numbers of employees grade 17 and above are relatively 
small (Reference data 4)

The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 place 
a new mandatory requirement to report annually on our gender pay gap and 
publish the following information: 

the  mean  and median  gender  pay  gap  which  is  the  difference  between 
the  mean  and  median  hourly  rate  of  pay  of  male  full-pay  relevant 
employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees, expressed as 
a percentage of the male mean. 
 
the mean and median gender bonus gap which is the difference between 
the mean  and median  bonus  pay  paid  to male  relevant  employees  and 
that paid to female relevant employees, expressed as a percentage of the 
male mean. 
 
the proportions of male and female employees who received bonus pay. 
 
the proportions of male and female employees in quartile pay bands. 

9. 

10. 

Pay includes gross full pay April 2017 pay data for all staff and includes basic 
pay,  certain  allowances  and  shift  payments.  It  does  not  include  overtime 
payments.  
 
Bonus includes gross bonus payments in a 12 month period i.e. 6th April 16 
to 5th April 17 includes bonus payments received by building and trades staff 
in Building Services and Asset Management. They are paid on a productive

pay  system  (in  place  since  1994)  wherein  employees  accumulate  standard 
minute  values  for  each  task  completed.  It  is  based  on  output  for  work 
generated  over  and  above  the  required  level,  over  a  specified  period.  This 
accumulates to a bonus payment.  
 
Employers must not treat a woman less favourably than a man or a man less 
favourably  than  a  woman  in  its  pay  arrangements  on  the  basis  of  gender. 
The gender pay gap is the difference between the average pay of men and 
women expressed as a percentage. 
 
The mean gender pay gap: Southwark council has a mean gender pay gap 
of -10.69%. This indicates that on average Southwark male employees are 
paid lower than Southwark female employees by approximately 10.69%. 
 
The median gender pay gap: Southwark council has a median gender pay 
gap  of  -10%  which  suggests  that  typically  Southwark  male  employees  are 
paid  at  around  10%  lower  than  Southwark  female  employees.  The  hourly 
median pay for females is £18.23 compared to £16.58 for males. 
 
The average Bonus Pay: Southwark Council has a mean bonus gender pay 
gap of 74%. In the period to 6 April 2017, approximately 4.12% of Southwark 
male  employees  were  paid  a  bonus  payment  compared  to  0.04%  of 
Southwark  female  employees.  The  data  is  based  on  the  only  relevant 
operational bonus scheme for building and trades staff in Building Services 
and  Asset  Management.  This  is  a  local  longstanding  scheme  (since  1994) 
rooted  in  national  conditions.  A  review  of  how  the  bonus  payments  are 
awarded in this area revealed no issues of inequality or irregularity based on 
gender.  The  bonus  scheme  is  under  review  and  is  likely  to  be  replaced 
following consultation. 
 
The  proportion  of  male  and  female  employees  in  each  quartile  pay 
band: The distribution of men and women through the pay bands by quartile, 
as  shown  above,  does  not  reflect  the  overall  gender  composition  of  the 
workforce which is 51.7% male and 48.3% female. Notably, the proportion of 
men  and  women  in  the  lower  quartile  (shown  as  quartile1)  is  the  furthest 
from  the  overall  gender  composition  of  the  workforce  at  33.46%  female, 
66.54% male. A review of the data highlights that for the quartile, there were 
1061 employees, 408 of which were cleaning operatives (a male dominated 
job role); 394 of the 408 cleaning operatives were male.

Disabilities  
 
9. 

Southwark  records  actual  employee  declarations  of  a  disability.    Since  the 
introduction  of  the  Disability  Discrimination  Act  when  the  use  of  strict 
externally  set  criteria  to  determine  “disability”  ceased,  self  declaration  is 
appropriate.  It  is  known  that  some  other  boroughs  determine  the  disability 
average by extrapolating from survey data or use sickness absence rates as a 
marker.  This  is  not  our  preferred  approach.  The  average  across  London 
boroughs is 5.7%, (Appendix 1). 
 
The percentage of people formally declaring a disability, 2.7% has reduced by 
0.6%  compared  to  the  previous  year  (Key  Data).    There  are  differences 
between departments.  (Reference data 5). 
 

10. 

11.  As part of our biannual employee survey, we ask staff whether they consider 
themselves to have a disability. 10% said they do, which is significantly higher 
than our formal records and indicates that not all disabled staff are formally 
declaring their disability. 
 
The percentages of employees with disabilities are lowest on Building Worker 
grades. There are some grade bands where there are no staff with a declared 
disability.  This applies to those grade bandings where numbers of staff are 
few. (Reference data 4)

There  are  a  small  number  of  employees  who  do  not  have  an  ethnic  origin 
record,  34  employees  (less  than  1%),  this  compares  with  an  average  of 
11.4% across London boroughs who do not have an ethnic origin (Appendix 
1). Those with no ethnic origin data recorded are predominately people who 
joined the council under TUPE agreements. (Key data).   
 
There is no significant change in the percentages of employees who classify 
themselves as white (51%) or from black and minority ethnic groups  (49%) 
compared to the previous year. (Key Data).    
 

15.  When  looking  at  broad  ethnic  groups  the  percentages  of  employees  from 
White and from BME communities are very similar to the percentages in the 
Southwark community, where 54% of the population classify themselves as 
White. (Appendix 1). Across London boroughs those employees who classify 
themselves as White average 61%. (Appendix 1).

there are higher percentages of BME staff than percentages of White staff.  
This changes at grades 10-12 and the percentages of BME employees are 
low in grades 14 and above. (Reference data 7)

The  average  age  of  employees  is  45.3  years.    (Key  Data).   There  is  not  a 
significant  range  (44-48)  across  London  but  our  average  is  similar  to  the 
median age of 45.8 years and younger than the majority of London boroughs 
(Appendix 1). 
 
The largest staff group is in the 40-54 years banding (44%) (Reference data 
8) although we are in the upper quartile in London for the 25-39 age group, 
which has increased since last year.

20.  Whist  our  employee  monitoring  data  does  not  currently  include  gender 
reassignment,  religion  or  sexual  orientation,  for  the  first  time,  our  biannual 
employee  survey  asked  staff  to  respond  to  questions  relating  to  these 
protected characteristics. 
 
Less than 0.5% of staff indicated that their gender identity does not match the 
gender assigned at birth.

Section 2: Changes in the Workforce   

There were 269 people who had started work with the council within the year. 
The  table  below  shows  the  person’s  department  at  the  end  of  the  financial 
year not necessarily the department at commencement. (Reference data 10) 
 
Those starting during this period have not resulted in any notable changes to 
the profile of the workforce in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin (Key data).

This  section  provides  a  detailed  look  at  the  reasons  why  people  leave  the 
organisation and their profile. 
 
The  dominant  reasons  for  people  leaving  were  on  a  voluntary  basis,  i.e. 
voluntary  redundancy,  resignation,  career  breaks,  retirement.  Other  reasons 
attracted relatively small numbers of employees.   
 
The  most  common  reason  for  leaving  during  2016-17  was  voluntary 
redundancy.  The  profile  of  disabled  staff  leaving  on  the  basis  of  voluntary 
redundancy was 5%. This has resulted in a notable reduction of the profile of 
the percentage of the disabled staff workforce (2.7%).  
 
Further scrutiny of those who left on the basis of dismissal, e.g. disciplinary or 
capability, appears in the relevant sections later in this report.

Section 4 – Sickness  
 
30.  Average sickness per person of 6.20 days, showed a decrease of 0.4 days 

per person (Reference data 19). This is lower than the average sickness 
across London boroughs of 7.8 days. (Appendix 1). Of note is the significant 
proportion of staff who had no sickness absence during the year (56%).  
 
There are multiple recorded reasons for sickness which are grouped as 
shown (Reference data 20).  The “internal disorders” grouping alone covers 
over a hundred conditions, but will include chronic health disorders such as 
angina, chest infections, stroke etc. 
 

31. 

32.  At present a high percentage of sickness absence does not have a recorded 

reason and it is likely that this is resulting in underreporting of stress, 
depression and anxiety related absence which we know is the primary cause 
of sickness absence in the public sector. Changes are being made to our 
systems to improve data capture.  
 

33.  Occupational health data shows us that a high proportion of referrals are 

related to mental health conditions.

Section 5 – Learning & Development 
 
34. 

It is stressed that the data below shows training activities coordinated by the 
corporate  Organisational  Transformation  (OT)  team  and  recorded  in  the 
council’s Learning Management System (LMS).  Managers and staff record all 
other training/ learning and development locally. The OT team have procured 
a  new  learning  management  system  which  will  improved  reporting,  and  this 
will be introduced in the third quarter of 2017/18.   
 
The data suggests that when looking at training events:- 

•  The  proportion  of  those  attending  is  broadly  in  line  with  the  proportion  of 

people from different ethnic groups in the workforce, (reference data 21) 
 

•  The proportion of people who are disabled attending training events is higher 
than the proportion of disabled staff (2.7%) in the workforce. (Reference data 
22) 

35. 
 

 

•  The proportion of women attending training events is higher than the 

proportion of women (51%) in the workforce. (Reference data 23)

36.  Southwark is very committed to supporting the development of its workforce.  
There  are  two  well-established  programmes  to  support  this  across  the 
organisation.  The first, apprentices and first entry training support entry into 
the  council  and  the  second,  leadership  and  management  qualifications 
through  the  Institute  of  Leadership  and  Management.    74  managers  have 
started  a  new  management  programme  at  levels  2,  3  and  5  in  2016/17.   
Since  the  inception  of  the  ILM  programme  in  2014,  234  managers  have 
completed  an  ILM  programme,  and  98  are  partly  through  their  studies.   
 

19 | P a g e 
 

37.  Southwark  has  a  council  plan  target  to  have  3%  of  the  workforce  who  are 
apprentices or first entry trainees.  The total of individuals in Southwark over 
2016/17 was 98 apprentices and 28 trainees, or a total of 126 which equates 
to 3.03% of the workforce. 

 
 

 

20 | P a g e 
 

38.  Note – two separate activities are described in this section; staff subject to 

disciplinary investigation and the outcomes of disciplinary hearings.  The 
information below is not necessary linked, i.e. some of the cases are captured 
in “investigations” would not have reached the stage of a completed 
disciplinary hearing. 
 

39.  The number of staff who were subject to disciplinary investigation and/or 

disciplinary action is a very small percentage of all employees, 0.8% 
(Reference data 24 & Key Data).   
 

40.  On 13 occasions disciplinary actions resulted in either a warning or dismissal. 

(References data 26 & 27).  Those subject to such actions are 0.3% of all 
employees, (key data).  Where there are such small numbers drawing 
conclusion based on more detailed levels, e.g. gender, ethnic profile or 
disability is questionably statistically valid. 
 
It is difficult to draw conclusions from relatively low numbers when considered 
against the overall workforce. However these numbers should be subject to 
further analysis and monitoring to ascertain whether more detailed action is 
necessary.

employees,  (key  data).    Where  there  are  such  small  numbers  drawing

Section 8 - Staff Complaints 
 
43.  Note this data relates to individual employee complaints that require a formal 

process to resolve.  Many complaints can be resolved informally or through 
mediation; all parties are encouraged to pursue such actions as a first step. 
 
The numbers of staff that submit a formal complaint at stage 1 are very few.  
(Reference data 30 & 31); 24 employees represent 0.6% of the workforce. 
(Key data). 
 

45.  Stage 2 complaints are those where the employee is not satisfied with the 

44. 

outcome at stage one and identifies grounds for appeal.   
 

46.  Where there are such small numbers drawing conclusions at a more detailed 

level, e.g. gender, ethnic profile or disability is questionably valid.

Section 10 - Recruitment  
 
49. 

The following looks at recruitment projects over the year 2016-17.  A 
recruitment project is an advertised job(s) with a defined closing date.  More 
than one media (advertisements) may be used in each project. The following 
looks at 365 recruitment projects; of these  

•  There were 26, each with 50 or more applicants. 
•  There were 157 each with 5 or less applicants. 

 

50.  Some jobs have been the subject of more than one recruitment project.  For 

example, Advanced Practitioner appears several times, each project is 
counted separately.  Only those projects that attracted an applicant response 
are shown. Applicants who withdrew from the process are excluded 
completely from the details below. 
 

51.  Overall there were 5,992 people who pursued an application.   

52. 

 
Looking at gender and disability the success of people at the hired stage of 
the recruitment process are in line with the percentages of people who 
applied, i.e. female / male, not disabled / disabled, (Reference data 34 & 35).

Appendix 1 

 
Information on the community in Southwark & other London Boroughs  
 
Southwark’s  workforce  is  drawn  from  across  London  &  the  South-east  of  England 
approximately 27%1 of our staff were Southwark residents.  It is however interesting 
to look at how the profile of the workforce compares to the Southwark community and 
where possible across London. 
 
(1Borough residency is not an indicator on HR records and this figure has been compiled from 
home address/ post code information). 
 
This  Section  provides  some  basic  information  about  the  Borough  drawn  from  the 
2011 census.   
 
It  also  includes  key  data  comparing  the  council’s  workforce  with  other  London 
boroughs,  albeit  this must  viewed  with  caution.    Increasingly  the  services  provided 
will  differ  between  boroughs.  This  will,  for  example,  impact  on  the  gender  profile 
where  particular  services  remain  male  or  female  dominated.        Service  type  and 
organisation  size  is  also  known  to  affect  how  organisations  perform,  for  example 
sickness absence tends to be higher in large multi functional organisations.

Other Boroughs 
 
The following information relates to year 2016/17.  The data that is shown is based 
on no fewer than submissions from 33 London boroughs although not every borough 
will have submitted data for every area.   
 
 
In considering this information – 
 

•  The London mean (average) data is shown. 

• 

It  must  be  re-emphasised  that  there  are  significant  differences  in  the 
organisations  presenting  data,  e.g.  Newham  has  around  4,670  directly 
employed staff (headcount), Sutton 1,100 directly employed staff (headcount).   

•  Organisations  collect  and  define  data  in  different  ways,  e.g.  some  councils 
extrapolate from survey information others such as Southwark rely on actual 
declarations.  

•  Only  data  which  links  to  Southwark’s  statistics  shown  in  the  body  of  this 

report is shown.  

 
1. Headcount of employees 

•  2,666 staff 

 
2. Average age 

•  45.77  years.  Across  London  boroughs  those  in  16-24  years  age  band  are 
3.26% of the workforce and those aged 65 and older are 3.93% . (Note there 
are  significant  variations  in  data  submitted  by  boroughs  in  response  to  this 
question,  one  borough’s  return  being  1.07%,  another  8.29%  and  1.50%  - 
32.49% respectively - which is out of step with all other responses)
