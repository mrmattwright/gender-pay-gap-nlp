We believe that publishing gender pay gap data (defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as the difference in median pay between men and women) on an annual basis will help employers, including ourselves, to see where action to close the gender pay gap is most needed. It will also help us to establish a benchmark for our own staff.  Hospitality has a historical bias toward one gender performing certain roles, so for example, chefs tend to be male and waiting staff female so we expected a relatively large Gender Pay Gap. However, across the UK, the latest official figures according to the ONS show that the median hourly pay for women is 18.4 per cent lower than for men and the gap in mean hourly pay is 17.4 per cent.  Our figures based on the snapshot date of 5th April 2017 are shown below.
