We are committed to treating all our people in a fair, inclusive and equal way, regardless of gender or any other protected characteristic.  The University has made significant and ongoing progress in improving its diversity and inclusivity, and we of proud of this. However, we recognise that there is more to do, and the new Gender Pay Gap Legislation offers fresh impetus for us to address the issue at University of Nottingham. Our actions and progress is covered in each of the reports below.  Gender Pay Gap Reporting Legislation  In 2017, the Government introduced legislation that made it statutory for organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on their gender pay gap. The University of Nottingham is covered by the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which came into force on 31 March 2017.  These regulations underpin the Public Sector Equality Duty and require the relevant organisations to publish their gender pay gap data by 30 March 2018, and then annually thereafter. You will find each annual report on this page, by 30 March on an annual basis.  University of Nottingham Annual Gender Pay Gap Reports  2017 University of Nottingham Gender Pay Gap Report  What is the Gender Pay Gap?  A Gender Pay Gap (GPG) shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. It is represented as a percentage, where a positive number is a pay gap in favour of men, and a negative number is a pay gap in favour of women.  The Gender Pay Gap is not the same as an Equal Pay Gap.  What is the difference between a Gender Pay Gap and Equal Pay Gap?  Equal Pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. For the University, equal value is defined and measured by each of our current staff levels (1-7). It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.  The Gender Pay Gap shows the differences in the average pay between all men and women across the entire organisation, regardless of the level/grade at which they work.  We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing work of equal value across the University. This ethos of equal pay is underpinned by a robust job evaluation system. We regularly carry out Equal Pay Reviews to ensure that men and women at the University are paid equally for work of equal value. The most recent review was carried out in 2017.   What data is published under the Gender Pay Gap Legislation?     The Mean Hourly Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Median Hourly Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Mean Bonus Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The Median Bonus Pay Gap (%) of all Full Pay Relevant Employees  The proportion (%) of women and men who received Bonus Pay  The proportion (%) of women and men on 4 equal population quartiles.
