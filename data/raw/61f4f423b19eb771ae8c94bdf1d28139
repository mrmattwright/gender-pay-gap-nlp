Our 2017  
Gender pay 
gap report

www.dialog-semiconductor.comIntroduction

At Dialog we are committed to employing 
and developing those people who have the 
necessary skills, experience and values to 
excel in their relevant role – irrespective of 
their gender or ethnicity, religion, disability 
or any other non-work related personal 
characteristic. Across our 33 locations in 16 
countries we employ a diverse workforce 
with employees from 65 nationalities.
The electronic engineering profession in 
the UK performs relatively poorly both in 
terms of gender diversity and gender pay. 
According to the Office of National Statistics 
(ONS), out of the 31,900 electronics engineers 
employed in the UK, 30,469 are men. So only 
4.5% of electronics engineers in the UK are 
female. In 2016 the mean gender pay gap for 
electronics engineers in the UK was 23.4% 
(ONS). It is within this context that we present 
our gender pay gap report.

There has been much analysis of why there is 
such lack of gender diversity in our industry, 
with growing focus being placed on invisible, 
structural considerations that may induce 
a degree of self-deselection (i.e. rather than 
any conscious barriers on the part of the 
sector). Women are underrepresented in the 
electronics and semiconductor industry and 
also in our workforce. 
Our industry is a very innovative, stimulating 
and fast developing field and we are very keen 
to raise awareness amongst women both 
inside and outside the Company about the 
exciting careers available to them at Dialog.
This is our report for the snapshot date of 
5 April 2017. I can confirm that the data 
published in this report is accurate.

The gender pay gap presented in this report shows 
the difference in the average pay between all men 
and women in a workforce. The gender pay gap 
gives a snapshot of the gender balance within a 
hierarchy. It measures the difference between the 
average earnings of all men and all women across an 
organisation, irrespective of their role. It is expressed 
as a percentage of men’s average earnings.
The report does not look at equal pay (differences 
between men and women who carry out the same 
jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value). Equal pay 
means that men and women must be paid the 
same for carrying out work of equal value for the 
same employer, as set out in the Equality Act 2010.
We have analysed the reasons for our gender 
pay gap and it can be explained by the small 
number of women in engineering jobs and by 
underrepresentation of women at higher levels 
in the organisation. 
We also did a comparison of like for like jobs 
(same job function/same level), and we were 
able to track any pay differences to factors like 
experience and performance. 
Our gender pay gap is due to lack of women in 
senior roles and lack of women in engineering roles, 
i.e. the gender balance in the hierarchy, and not 
due to gender discrimination. 

What are our Challenges?
Some of the challenges contributing to 
the gender pay gap in our industry and at 
Dialog include:
> Men are more likely than women to pursue careers 
in highly paid occupations such as engineering.
> Women do not progress to leadership levels as 
quickly or as often as men, e.g. only 6 of the FTSE 
100 companies are led by women.
> The number of female engineers in the company 
is low, but slightly higher than the percentage of 
female electronics engineers in the UK. 
> There are challenges recruiting female engineers 
in the UK – only 9% of engineers in the UK are 
female (IET) and only 4.5% of electronics engineers 
in the UK are female (ONS).

What actions have we taken?
As a company, we are determined to work 
towards closing the gender pay gap. Some of 
the initiatives we have already put in place to 
support this aim are:
> Dialog is a corporate member of the Women in 
Engineering Society, in particular sponsoring the 
annual student conference.
> We are also a corporate sponsor of Edinburgh 
International Science Festival which aims to 
encourage young people into science, technology, 
engineering and maths (STEM) careers.
> As a founder member of UK Electronic Skills 
Foundation (UKESF), we support the UKESF to 
promote electronics careers in schools. 
> Dialog supports a range of local volunteering 
activities encouraging girls to take up and continue 
with STEM subjects in school.
> We train our managers on how to avoid biases in 
recruitment and selection.
> Through focus groups we have gathered feedback 
from our female staff on the changes they would 
like to see in order to make Dialog an even better 
place for them to work and we are taking actions 
on the recommendations made.

Our aspiration is to increase the number of 
female engineers and leaders in the company 
and to promote career progression of women 
to management and leadership levels and 
in technical careers.
> We will offer our female engineers networking 
opportunities and support through the sponsorship of 
individual membership of the Women in Engineering 
Society for all UK-based female engineers in 
the company.
> We will ensure female engineers are represented 
on all high potential development programmes 
where we have an incumbent population.
> We are implementing gender neutral recruitment 
and promotion practices and will be monitoring 
our processes.
> As the lack of female electronics engineers in the 
UK can only be addressed with long-term measures, 
we are focussing on increasing our intake of female 
engineering graduates and will target an increase 
in hiring of female graduate engineers year-on-year.
> We will fund two university scholarships for female 
university students studying electronics engineering, 
provided through the UKSEF, one in England and 
one Scotland. 

Testimonials

At Dialog we believe that 
diversity is vital to bring in 
different ways of looking at 
things and foster innovation. 
Although challenging to hire 
a large number of women 
in engineering, we are 
focusing on bringing in a 
higher proportion of female 
graduates and continue to 
look globally at countries 
where there are a higher 
proportion of women in 
our field”.
Julie Pope
Senior Vice President Human Resources
“Having recently joined 
Dialog from university, I am 
delighted to feel part of such 
an inclusive and diverse 
community. It is encouraging 
to see that Dialog is passionate 
about addressing the gender 
pay gap challenge and doing 
what they can to encourage 
more girls into engineering 
earlier in life”.
Chloe Jones
Graduate Design Engineer

Dialog recognises the 
commitment and hard 
work of all employees 
and understands that 
in our global working 
environment, individuals 
need to be supported 
with balancing work and 
personal commitments. 
Flexibility around working 
time and working location 
was raised by our employees 
as one of the most important 
things we could do internally 
to make working at Dialog 
even more inclusive. 
Our flexible working policy 
now provides flexibility for 
working hours, time off in lieu 
and remote working to enable 
our employees to achieve 
a healthy work life balance. 
We are also supporting both 
women and men with a wide 
range of flexible working 
arrangements such as school 
hours, compressed hours 
and part-time working”.
Hasan Khan
Vice President Central Engineering

We are an organisation with 
many talented women and 
men from different cultures 
all working together and 
yet still sharing the same 
basic goal and passion: to 
solve engineering problems 
every day and create the 
best products. With the 
increasing awareness on the 
gender pay gap, I am happy 
to be part of our company 
that supports schools and 
universities to inspire young 
girls to pursue STEM careers 
and to make sure there isn’t 
any unconscious bias in 
our processes”.
