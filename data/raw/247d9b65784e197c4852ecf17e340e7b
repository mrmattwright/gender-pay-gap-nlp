It has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex or any other characteristic set out above. As such it: Carries out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals; Provides regular equal pay training for all Leaders and other staff members who are involved in pay reviews; and Evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure. The Company is required by law - Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 to publish an annual gender pay gap report. The company reports for the snapshot date of 5th April 2018. The mean gender pay gap for the Company is 11.3% The median gender pay gap for the Company is 18.2% The mean gender bonus gap for the Company is 30% The median gender bonus gap for the Company is 40% the 100% of employees both Male and Female are included in the bonus scheme. The number if male and female employees paid in each quartile:- (These quartiles have been calculated using a range of hourly rates held within our organisation).   Gross Hourly Rate of Pay (No. of Employees) Gender Lower Quartile Lower Middle Quartile Upper Middle Quartile Upper Quartile Female 44% 18% 19% 23% Male 56% 82% 81% 78% The figures set out above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010  (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.   The Company is confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the types of roles men and women undertake within the Company and the salaries that these roles attract.  A significant number of employees within our organisation are within Sales. These roles are largely held by male employees. The Sales division works to a commission plan which has a higher earnings potential compared to the bonus scheme available to core staff. The figures show above combine commission and bonuses earned.  We believe that the Company's gender pay gap is in line with that of organisations within our industry sector and we are committed to doing everything that we can to reduce the gap. We established a women's network in 2015 to focus on the development of females within the organisation and attracting women to the organisation. We work with local schools and colleges to promote a career in IT and Manufacturing and the development of STEM subjects for girls. We have introduced an anonymous application process within our sales community. We promote an inclusive culture and deliver diversity awareness training as part of our Leadership curriculum. However, the Company also recognises that its scope to act is limited in some areas - it has, for example, no direct control over the subjects that individuals choose to study or the career choices that they make. However, the company has representation on the Essex Skills Board and Opportunities South Essex to influence school's curriculum.  To date, the steps that the Company has taken to promote gender diversity in all areas of its workforce include the following: Creating an evidence base: To identify any barriers to gender equality and inform priorities for action, in 2016 the Company introduced gender monitoring to understand: the proportions of men and women applying for jobs and recruited; the proportions of men and women applying for and obtaining promotions; the proportions of men and women leaving the organisation and their reasons for leaving; the numbers of men and women in each role and pay band; take-up of flexible working arrangements by gender and level within the organisation; the proportion of men and women who return to their original job after a period of maternity or other parental leave; and the proportion of men and women still in post a year on from a return to work after a period of maternity or other parental leave. The company has plans to extend its evidence-gathering to include qualitative data. It will do this through our Women's Network or a consultation exercise across all areas and levels within the Company to identify the barriers (and the drivers) for female employees. Revising Bonus Policy: In March 2017, the Company has revised its Bonus Payment Policy to make it transparent, objective and consistent across all areas and levels within the Company. Reviewing the Flexible Working policy: The Company's Flexible Working policy is currently under review to make it clear that employees in all areas and levels of the Company will be considered for flexible working regardless of their role and level of seniority, and that flexible working need not be limited to part-time working. In addition we are encouraging greater flexibility in working hours and locations to ensure all employees have the greatest opportunity to work. Any further initiatives launched throughout the year will be reported on the Company's intranet.
