Why not Increase Font Size  Decrease Font Size    Gender Pay Gap Statement   Legislation requires Scimitar Care Hotels PLC to publish annually the organisations gender pay statistics.  Job roles at Scimitar Care Hotels are paid at the same rate regardless of gender and we are committed to ensure that employees receive equal pay for equal value.  Scimitar Care Hotels supports and promotes equality of opportunity for all employees and believes as part of this ethos that employees should receive equal pay for the same or broadly similar work, regardless of their personal circumstances, political affiliation, union activity or ‘protected characteristics’ under the Equality Act (2010).  The information shows our pay gap and bonus pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017 and bonuses paid in the year to 5 April 2017.  We believe in being an inclusive and diverse organization where everyone has an equal opportunity to reach their full potential.  I confirm that the data reported is accurate.  Paul Sargeant Managing Director Scimitar Care Hotels PLC 22 March 2018     Hourly Rate - Women's hourly rate is 36.1% lower (mean) / 8.5% lower (median)  Bonus Pay - Women's bonus pay is 14.9% higher (mean) / 0% lower (median)  Who received bonus 84.2% Men / 89.6% Women  Pay quartiles How many men and women are in each quarter of the employer's payroll   Upper quartile 21% Men    79% Women  Upper middle quartile 8% Men      92% Women  Lower middle quartile 7% Men      93% Women  Lower quartile 7% Men      93% Women   Pay Gap The median figure is used because the distribution of earnings is skewed, with more people earning lower salaries than higher salaries. When using the mean to calculate the average of a skewed distribution, it is highly influenced by those values at the upper end of the distribution and thus may not be truly representative of the average earnings of a typical person.  We are pleased that our median figures are significantly lower than the national average.  Bonus Pay Gap The gender gap in our bonus pay reflects what we see in our business – we have a higher proportion of females in our top pay quartile that are eligible for a bonus payment and this accounts for female staff receiving 14.9% higher bonuses than men.  Quartile Distribution Our workforce is made up of significantly more female than male staff, a profile reflecting the current nature of the social care sector and this is reflected across all of the pay quartiles.  Our Board of Directors is 40% female.        Providers of Exceptional Care   Scimitar Care Hotels PLC excels in providing many different facets of care, click the below for more details.
