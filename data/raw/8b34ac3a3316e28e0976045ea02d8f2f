Gender Pay Gap Report

Introduction

At Celsian, we welcome the 
opportunity to share our gender 
pay gap as it will help us have 
more meaningful conversations 
with our people and our  
customers about equality,  
diversity and inclusion. 

Celsian has an overall median 
gender pay gap of 44%.  
This is because of the gender  
make up of our workforce,  
where women make up the 
majority of the lowest paid roles. 
In the education sector, women 
make up 80% of the workforce,  
yet are under-represented in the 
highest paid roles. For example, 
60% of secondary school 
headteachers are men.

Of the people included in the 
calculations, 92% are temporary 
workers whose pay is fixed by our 
customers. In the interests of full 
disclosure, we have also chosen  
to provide an analysis of our  
45 permanent UK employees.

Among Celsian’s own employees 
our median gender pay gap 
is -1.73%. Our pay structure 
equally rewards men and women 
performing the same roles, but 
women account for almost two-
thirds of employees in the highest 
salary quartile, and over half in  
the upper-middle quartile. Women 
also occupy the majority of roles 
attracting high bonus payments. 

We have made good progress with 
diversity and inclusion at Celsian 
and understanding our gender  
pay gap drives us to do more.

We are investing in a range of 
initiatives to bring about change 
and this report outlines more detail 
about what we are undertaking as 
part of a broader focus on creating 
a more inclusive workplace.

Celsian Education Gender Pay Gap ReportUnderstanding  
the gender pay gap 

Gender pay vs equal pay 

A gender pay gap shows the difference in average  
pay across all of the men and women in an organisation,  
industry or country as a whole. It can be driven by the  
differing number of men and women across all roles. 

It is not the same as an equal pay comparison which  
looks at how much men and women are paid for doing  
the same role. 

How we calculated  
our numbers

Under the UK Government’s new Gender Pay Gap regulation, 
companies need to report their gender pay gap for all legal 
entities in Great Britain with more than 250 employees.  
We have provided data on all of our permanent and 
temporary employees, as required by the regulation. 

Given we are a staffing business we have a very high  
number of temporary workers on our payrolls at any  
one time. This number fluctuates depending on requirements 
from our clients, and typically the rate of pay that our 
temporary workers receive is decided by our clients.  
We have also reported on our permanent employees  
only and our temporary employees only. 

Pay quartiles explained

A pay quartile is calculated by listing the hourly pay rates  
for everyone in the business then dividing them into four  
equal sized groups. We then work out the percentage  
of men and women in each group.

Median and mean  
gaps explained

The figure used most regularly is the median gender  
pay gap. To help bring this to life, imagine all of the women 
at Celsian standing in one line, from lowest paid by hour to 
highest, and all of the men doing the same in another line. 
The median gender pay gap is the percentage difference  
in hourly pay between the woman in the middle of the line 
and the man in the middle of the line. Hourly pay includes 
leave and any shift premiums, but not overtime.

Lowest paid

Median

Highest paid

The mean gender pay gap is the percentage difference  
in the average pay of men and women. This is calculated  
by adding up all of the hourly pay rates for all of the women 
in a business and dividing it by the number of women, then 
doing the same for the men and comparing the difference. 
The mean can be affected by different numbers of men  
and women in different roles. This is why we also report  
the number of men and women in different pay quartiles. 

We also report the median and mean differences in bonus 
pay over a twelve month period, and the percentage  
of men and women who received a bonus. 

A positive percentage shows a gap in favour of men;  
a negative percentage shows a gap in favour of women.

Celsian Education Gender Pay Gap ReportHow we are building  
an inclusive business

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse business built on trust, and the following initiatives support our goals:

1.  We are providing  

our candidates with  
Continual Professional 
Development (CPD)

 

 As the hourly rates for our temporary workers are  
set by our clients, we have little control over their pay. 
However, Celsian has recently appointed a manager  
for Continual Professional development who is 
responsible for running training courses for our temporary 
workers in order to upskill them, and consequently  
give them the opportunity to earn a higher hourly rate. 

2.  We support a Diversity  
and Inclusion Network

 

 As part of the Impellam Group, we participate actively 
in the Diversity and Inclusion network which fosters an 
inclusive and diverse workforce by encouraging positive 
conversations that drive clear action.

3.  We are building a culture  

 

of Virtuosity 
 We continue to invest in our Virtuoso programme 
which recognises that it is our managers who make 
the difference in building trust, relationships and 
better futures for our clients and our people. This focus 
on Virtuosity is central to our strategy and frees our 
managers from conventional thinking so they see new 
possibilities, enabling our people to realise their full 
potential and to thrive.

4.  We address unconscious bias

 

 All our people take and have access to training via  
our online learning system to help them understand, 
identify and address unconscious bias. We also offer  
this training to our customers as and when appropriate.

5.  We facilitate conversations 

around flexible working

 

 We are an inclusive business, and we encourage 
flexibility, including part-time work and home working. 
We hold conversations with managers through Open 
Blend, our coaching and development platform,  
which enables us to explore whether personal  
ambitions are being met, as well as business objectives. 
By addressing the whole person, we will create a more 
engaged, productive workforce that allows our people 
to be their authentic selves at work.
