The information below is based on the requirement date of 5th April 2017.   Our overall mean gender pay gap is 10.7%   Pay Information  Mean hourly pay difference between male and female employees: 10.7%  Median hourly pay difference between male and female employees: 15.8%  Stateside Foods Ltd’s gender pay gap is significantly lower than the UK mean gender pay gap of 14.1% and lower than the UK median gender pay gap of 18.4%. We are an equal pay employer. All employees are paid the same rate for doing the same job. There is no difference between the rates paid to men and women.   Quartiles  Of the 221 employee’s in the lower quartile 134 are male and 87 are female.  This means 60.6% are male and 39.4% are female.  Of the 221 employee’s in the lower middle quartile 166 are male and 55 are female.  This means 75.1% are male and 24.9% are female.  Of the 221 employee’s in the upper middle quartile 181 are male and 40 are female.  This means 81.9% are male and 18.1% are female.  Of the 220 employee’s in the upper quartile 171 are male and 49 are female.  This means 77.7% are male and 22.3% are female.  The pay quartiles show that at entry level the split between male and female is the most even. At the other levels there is a higher representation of males versus females.  This is an area of focus for the business.   Bonus Information  The mean gender bonus pay gap percentage is 23.9%  The median gender bonus pay gap percentage is 0%  Out of 652 relevant male employees 15 were paid a bonus.  Out of 231 relevant female employees 5 were paid a bonus.  This means 2.3% of all relevant males were paid a bonus and 2.2% of all relevant females were paid a bonus.  The mean bonus difference is related to higher percentage of male employees in upper quartile roles.   What we are doing to improve our Gender Pay Gap?  We are actively looking at ways to address the gender split throughout our business, and have a range of initiatives in place to do this.  Flexible working  We support all of our employees through shared parental leave, job sharing, part time opportunities, ‘keeping in touch’ and flexible working arrangements. Employees are able to request flexible working such as part-time working and shorter days.  Recruitment  As an employer we want to employ the best person for the job and pay competitive rates to attract talent.  We are an equal pay employer and pay employees the same rates of pay for the same grade regardless of sex. As we grow we will continue to offer fair equitable pay to all of our employees.  We currently recruit based on our employee behaviours, which reduces unconscious bias and ensures that we have a fair recruiting process.  Employee Benefits  We are further enhancing our employee benefits offerings with enhanced maternity pay to attract key skills and talent back into the workplace after maternity leave.  Training & Development  We are committed to employee involvement and provide a variety of career development opportunities. All employees are actively encouraged to express their views and contribute towards business improvement through our Continuous Improvement Programme, Employee Open Forums, and other initiatives.  We recognise that our most important resource is our employees. We develop our people providing them with nationally recognised qualifications and ensure that all employees gain necessary skills to reach their full potential.  Our recent growth has enabled many of our employees to advance their careers through the opportunities that we create at all levels of our company. We have always been an organisation where people can thrive and develop regardless of their gender or background.  With our plans to continue to develop these initiatives it will help improve our gender pay gap further.  I confirm the information published above is accurate.
