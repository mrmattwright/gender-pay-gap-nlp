The data published is based on a snapshot date in April 2017.  In this document we outline the ways in which the different measures are calculated, and our results. The calculations have been made according to a strict formula, with all the results published on the Government’s Gender Pay Gap Service website . This shows that in comparison to most other large employers Clarion has a very small gender pay gap. This reflects the work we have done over many years to ensure our organisation is free from the bias which allows the gender pay gap to grow.
