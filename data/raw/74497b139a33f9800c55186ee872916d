Results for DDD  DDD is committed to treating all employees equally, so we are pleased that our work force is almost exactly split between males (48.5%) and females (51.5%) and that our mean Gender Pay Gap is less than the national average (7.6% versus 17.4% nationally).  However, we acknowledge that there is a gap, and we are examining ways that we can reduce this to zero.  Underlying causes of the pay gap  We have examined our pay structures, and we can confidently state that men and women are paid the same for the same job.  The pay gap is a result of two factors:   Over 10% of our female workforce work part time hours, as part of our commitment to being a flexible employer.  Part time roles tend to be lower paid, but allow women to juggle their work and home lives.  Operatives in the factory are twice as likely to be women than men. This is the lowest paid area of the business.  We are proud of our record of promoting both men and women from the factory floor to a wide variety of roles elsewhere in the business.   Next steps  We are considering a variety of ways to reduce the pay gap to zero:   We are reviewing our diversity and inclusion policies.  We want to ensure that we invest in our learning and development programs to give women the chance to take on new roles and responsibilities within the business.  We will continue to make it easy for women to re-enter the workforce after career breaks by being flexible with working patterns.   We will continue to monitor and publish these results.
