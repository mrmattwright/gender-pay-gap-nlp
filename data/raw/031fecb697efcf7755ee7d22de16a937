Gender Pay Gap - Statistics 
 

As an employer of more than 250 staff, Aberlour has undertaken Gender Pay Gap 
Reporting as required by the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017. 
The gender pay gap in an organisation is the difference in pay levels between 
male and female employees, irrespective of the position held. This is different from 
equal pay - where companies are required to ensure that men and women are 
paid the same for doing the same or similar roles. 
Our workforce is predominantly female, with women making up 82% of our staff. 
We are confident that men and women are paid fairly and equally for the same or 
similar roles. 
We are pleased to report that Aberlour has no median pay gap, and a small 
mean pay gap of 7%, which is less than the UK average of 18%. 
The data below relates to information from 5th April 2017.

Aberlour does not pay bonuses and therefore has no figures relating to mean or 
median bonus pay gaps.

Gender Pay Gap – Next Steps 

 
 
Aberlour pays all staff at or above the real Living Wage rate of £8.75 per hour (as 
recommended by the Living Wage Foundation).  Furthermore, Aberlour operates a 
job evaluation scheme to review the size of each role in relation to others within 
the organisation.  Therefore, we are confident that men and women are paid fairly 
and equally for the same or similar roles. 
 
However, as can be seen by the under-representation of men within the lowest 
pay quartile compared to our average male/female split, female workers occupy 
the majority of the lowest paid positions within Aberlour.  Such posts include 
domestic staff, cooks and administrators; they are often part-time posts and do not 
attract many male applicants.  The volume of such posts across our 40 services is 
one of the main reasons for our mean gender pay gap. 
 
We have also excluded data for 20 staff who were not receiving full pay on the 
trigger date of 5th April 2017 due to maternity leave or long-term sickness.  All staff 
within this excluded group were female. 
 
As an organisation committed to building a fairer and more equal society we will 
continue to ensure recruitment practices are transparent and fair (for example we 
advocate mixed gender recruitment panels for all posts). Meanwhile we will 
review any perceived barriers to reducing the gender pay gap and work to 
overcome these.
