However, there are still many advances in science and technology being made right across the fuel cycle. These developments will help meet the challenges of future energy demands and security of supply. They will help make improvements in efficiency and safety of nuclear operations and clean-up. And they will also help in securing long term waste management solutions including disposal and in the area of radiological-nuclear threat reduction.
