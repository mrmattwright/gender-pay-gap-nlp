At 3.4% Balmoral Comtec Limitedâ€™s mean hourly gender pay gap is significantly lower than the national
average, while the median hourly fixed pay gap is 20% higher for females than males.  This is because
female employees fall predominantly in the middle pay bands within the company.

Balmoral Comtec Limited is an equal opportunities employer and recruits the best people for the job.
The gender imbalance and structural workforce challenges that the company faces are indicative of wider
issues in the United Kingdom such as the lower number of females studying STEM subjects at university
and going into STEM careers, and certain manufacturing industry roles being more appealing to males,
a view Balmoral continues to challenge.

I confirm that the Balmoral Comtec Limited gender pay gap calculations are accurate and fully meet the
requirements of the legislation.
