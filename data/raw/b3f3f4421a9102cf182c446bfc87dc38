Gender Pay Gap Report 

At MEATliquor, we believe that everyone has the same opportunity to develop in their role, no 
matter their gender, age, background, belief or nationality. 

The table below shows MEATliquor’s gender pay gap and gender bonus gap at the snap shot 
date of 5th April 2017. 

A positive figure shows a higher percentage to men, a negative figure shows a higher percentage 
to women 

Gender Pay Gap 

 
Hourly Rate 

Mean  
15.5 

Median 
7.0 

 
Our mean pay gap was worked out by comparing the hourly rates of all male and female full pay 
relevant employees at MEATliquor. At 15.5%, our mean hourly rate difference is better than the 
ONS anticipated gender pay gap of 18%.  

The median pay gap is the difference between the hourly rate for the man and woman at the middle 
point of the list. Our median difference is 7%.

The above is based on a list of team members by payment, then split into four equal groups 
(quartiles). We then looked at the gender of each quartile. 

There is a good balance of men and women in the lower and lower middle quartiles. However, 
we are striving to increase our number of female employees in the upper quartile by offering 
flexible working and ensuring that the development of women is high priority for the business 
over the coming years.
