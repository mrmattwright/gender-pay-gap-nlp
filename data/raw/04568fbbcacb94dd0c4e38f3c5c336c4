Transparency helps to drive change and is a key feature of the council’s Gender Equality Charter.  We are doing lots of remarkable things for gender equality, including: the first council in the Country to develop and launch a Gender Equality Charter; a month-long programme of events for Women’s Empowerment, which we have hosted over the last three years; a thriving Women’s Network; and Women’s Empowerment Awards to mark the diverse achievements of the women of Barking and Dagenham.  It is because of our programmes and efforts that we have closed the mean hourly pay gap at senior, middle and professional levels in our organisation. We have a gender-balanced senior leadership team, and we are one of few councils in the country with more women than men on our political Cabinet.  We are proud to be an employer that pays at or above the London Living Wage, with good pay and conditions, including access to pensions and other staff benefits. This means that services such as building cleaning and school catering, which are services predominantly undertaken by women, many of whom live locally, have not been outsourced to private sector companies who would slash their conditions of employment. To highlight this point, we pay our building cleaners the London Living Wage, they are entitled to be members of the local government pension scheme and they have access to a range of other staff benefits including sick pay and annual leave. These are significantly better terms than are offered in some parts of the private sector. However, retaining this service in-house does affect our overall pay gap data because of the large number of employees in this service and because the majority of them are women.  We know that many other Local Authorities and public-sector organisations have outsourced cleaning and school catering services to private contractors, which means these workers are excluded from their pay gap data. Were we to compare ourselves with those authorities or organisations on a like for like basis our median gap would reduce to 0.3%. The predominance of women in occupations, such as cleaning, catering and caring is a long-term societal issue but one we are determined to tackle. We are fully committed to removing the barriers that create gender segregation in our workforce and hope that through greater transparency these issues will be addressed across the nation. For Barking and Dagenham, this means working hard to encourage more men to work in cleaning, catering and caring professions and more women to work in what have been traditional male occupations.  We are also required to publish information about bonus pay. The council doesn’t have a bonus pay scheme for the Chief Executive, Senior Leadership Team and other senior managers. Indeed, the vast majority of the 3,000 staff in Barking and Dagenham do not receive a bonus payment of any kind. Under the gender pay reporting calculations, we do, however, have two specific schemes in place that we must report. One of these we inherited when the workforce in question was transferred into the council, and one which we introduced to attract and retain social workers. In relation to the transferred staff, we have a bonus scheme that we inherited under the TUPE regulations when our Repairs and Maintenance staff were transferred back into the council when the outsourced contract expired. This is currently an all-male group of staff, and the bonus arrangements are protected under legislation. Our other scheme is a specific recruitment and retention payment made to our hard to recruit and highly valued children’s social workers.  Our published data shows that only 180 staff receive these payments and we certainly don’t have bonus pay arrangements for any other groups, including senior management.  The gender pay gap is the average pay for women and average pay for men in an organisation, no matter what job they do. This is different to equal pay which deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs.  We have a long established accredited job evaluation arrangement which provides a recognised way to avoid equal pay issues.  We have a great approach to flexible working, supporting home working, part-time and term-time only working, and family friendly policies, which have helped us to attract and retain staff.  It matters to us that we keep our positive approach to gender equality under review, and over the next year we will track and publish our gender pay gap on a quarterly basis to continue to measure our progress.  I confirm that the calculations provided on the gender pay gap reporting website, and the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham’s website are correct.
