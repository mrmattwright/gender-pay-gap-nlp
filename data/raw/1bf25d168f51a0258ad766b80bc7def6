The figures must be calculated using a specific reference date each year, called the ‘snapshot date’.  The snapshot date is 5 April for businesses and charities and the data must be published within a year of the snapshot date.  Bethphage published its first gender pay gap report on 4th April 2018.  The regulations require employers to calculate specified information and publish the information on the employer’s website and on a designated government website at www.gov.uk/genderpaygap.  The gender pay gap differs from equal pay.  Equal Pay – Bethphage pays the same rates to men and women who carry out the same jobs in accordance with the law.  The gender pay gap shows the differences in average pay for men and women.  A number of factors influence this including seniority and the number of hours worked.        The Gender Pay Results for 5 April 2017  Based upon the snapshot date, Bethphage does not have a gender pay gap. Our female colleagues were paid marginally ahead of male colleagues on the snapshot date but just one male appointment at a senior level could reverse this.  As a registered charity, Bethphage is a values based organisation which, where possible, has an egalitarian approach to the treatment of its people. This is reflected in our approach to our performance bonus payments in which all colleagues, regardless of status received the same bonus proportionate to hours employed.  In the relevant period (6 April 2016 – 5 April 2017), the gender bonus gaps have been skewed because of the pay arrangements during the period when Bethphage operated without a CEO.  Without that factor, a negative mean bonus gap would have occurred because pro-rated bonuses received by the part-time employees are not adjusted for the purposes of the gender bonus gap calculations.  Significantly more of our female staff choose to work part-time (59% of all female workers) compared with their male colleagues (39% of all male workers).  Bonus payments are made to employees who meet various standard criteria, including time served with the company. During the reporting period proportionately more males received a bonus than women due to a lower staff turnover of males between the relevant dates.  Bethphage employs significantly more female colleagues than male staff, which is typical of the social care sector.  Of 303 staff on the snapshot date, 218 were female (72%) and 85 male (28%).  We are proud to have had consistent representation in similar proportions at all levels of the organisation, including the top team.
