This is known as the gender pay gap.  The calculations are:   The mean gender pay gap  The media gender pay gap  The mean bonus gender pay gap  The median bonus gender pay gap  The proportion of males receiving a bonus payment  The proportion of females receiving a bonus payment  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band   It is important to remember that the gender pay gap is different to equal pay.  Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of different value.  It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.  In contrast, the gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and all women in a workforce.  A high gender pay gap can indicate that the organisation has a number of challenges to deal with.  Some of these may be societal (eg an expectation that women will take on child-rearing responsibilities, that may result in a need to work part-time, which is generally lower-paid) and some may be specific to the organisation itself.  We publish figures for people employed by the Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, which includes officers, Police Community Support Officers, and some police staff.  The Police and Crime Commissioner also publishes the gender pay gap for the police staff that she employs, and that work within North Yorkshire Police on the same terms and conditions – although as this amounts to fewer than 250 people she does not have an obligation to do so.  The Chief Constable’s gender pay gap figures, published March 2018, are contained in the document below.  This document includes the statutory calculations together with some non-statutory information about the gender pay gap for our organisation.  From March 2018 North Yorkshire Police will be using the gender pay gap figures as part of our organisational “health-check”.  This will involve further research to understand in more detail the reasons behind any gender pay gap, so that we can take any necessary action.
