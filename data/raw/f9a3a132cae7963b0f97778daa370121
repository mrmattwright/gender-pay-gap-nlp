MCC is committed to equal opportunities for development, progression and equal treatment for  
all employees. MCC carries out pay and benefits audits at least once a year and evaluates job roles  
as necessary to ensure a fair structure of salaries. MCC attributes its small gender pay gap to the roles  
in which men and women work within the Club and the salaries that these roles attract. For example,  
the majority of the highest paid roles on the Secretariat are held by men. However, if the Secretariat 
salaries are removed from MCC’s calculations, the mean gender pay gap is reduced to 7.19%. This is 
because outside of the Secretariat, management roles, including Heads of Department roles, are more 
equally distributed between males and females.

While MCC’s gender pay gap compares favourably with that of organisations both across the UK  
and within the sport sector, this is not a subject about which MCC is complacent. We are committed to 
reducing the gap and recognise the benefits of a diverse workplace. The steps MCC has taken to promote 
gender diversity in all areas of its workforce to date, and the plans for the future include the following:

S U P P O R T I N G   P A R E N T S   MCC has implemented new policies supporting 
men and women prior to, during and on return from maternity, paternity and other 
parental leave.

F L E X I B L E   W O R K I N G   MCC recognises the importance of a good work life 
balance and the benefits of flexible working, regardless of personal circumstances. 

P O L I C I E S   A N D   P R O C E D U R E S   The HR and Legal Departments  
regularly review policies, procedures and practices to promote equality and 
inclusiveness. MCC adheres to its Diversity and Equality policy at all times.

R E C R U I T M E N T  MCC aims to attract and retain people who are the best in  
their field, with the right skills and with a range of diverse backgrounds. However,  
we will continue to identify any barriers to gender equality and better understand  
the proportions of men and women being recruited, applying for and obtaining 
promotions and leaving the Club, and their reasons for doing so. 

R E T U R N   F R O M   M A T E R N I T Y   L E A V E   Over the past five years,  
MCC has had an average maternity return rate of 80%, which is considerably above  
the national average maternity rate of 60% according to the Department of Trade  
and Industry.

T R A I N I N G   A N D   L E A R N I N G   O P P O R T U N I T I E S  MCC will  
continue to develop training and learning opportunities for all employees.

All employees are key to our future growth and ongoing success. MCC is confident that these initiatives, 
and further discussion across the Club, will help it reduce its gender pay gap.
