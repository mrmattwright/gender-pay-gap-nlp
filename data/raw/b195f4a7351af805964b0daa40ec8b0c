The gender pay gap shows the difference in average pay between all men and women in the workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with, and the individual calculations may help identify what those issues are.  The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.  Equals Trust is committed to fairness. In particular, promoting equality of opportunity for all and a culture, which values differences. As an employer, we want to ensure our workforce is representative of the community it serves and attract and retain talented employees from a wide range of backgrounds and with diverse skills and experience.
