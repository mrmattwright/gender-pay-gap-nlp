In  accordance  with  the  Equality  Act  2010  (Gender  Pay  Gap  Information)  Regulations  2017, 

employers with 250 or more employees are required to publish statutory calculations no later 

than 30 March each year; commencing 2017/18. The information will demonstrate the pay gap 

between  male  and  female  employees  as  at  31  March  the  previous  year.  For  example,  31 

March 2017 pay information must be published by 30 March 2018.  

The legislation requires an employer to publish six calculations:  

•  Average gender pay gap as a mean average  

•  Average gender pay gap as a median average  

•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average  

•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average  

•  Proportion  of  males  receiving  a  bonus  payment  and  proportion  of  females  receiving  a 

bonus payment  

•  Proportion  of  males  and  females  when  divided  into  four  groups  ordered  from  lowest  to 

highest pay. 

Gender  Pay  Gap  reporting  is  different  to  equal  pay  –  equal  pay  deals  with  the  pay  differences 

between men and  women  who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.  It  is 

unlawful  to  pay  people  unequally  because  of  gender.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Gender  Pay  Gap 

shows the difference in the average pay between men and wonmen in the workforce. 

CSH Surrey is governed by  the NHS terms and conditions of employment – Agenda for Change 

(AfC).  These  terms  contain  national  agreements  on  pay  and  conditions  of  service  for  the  NHS 

workforce as a whole ( other than very senior managers and medical workforce).  

Similarly, CSH Surrey has adopted the national NHS Job Evaluiation (JE) process which enables 

jobs  to  be  matched  to  the  national  job  profiles  and/or  allows  CSH  to  evaluate  jobs  locally,  to 

determine the appropriate pay band as outlined within AfC.  

In  line  with  the  legislative  requirements,  the  report  will  be  published  on  the  CSH  Surrey  website 

and  also  on  the  Governments  online  reporting  service  (http://www.gov.uk/report-gender-pay-gap-

data.)

The current gender split witihin the overall workforce is 90.8% female and 9.2% respectively. 

As expected, based on the traditional model of care being perceived as a female activity, the 

majority of the workforce at CSH continues to be high at 90.8%.

Key points / findings:  

  The  average  hourly  rate  of  pay  is  calculated  from  a  specific  pay  period  in  this  case  March 

2017(snapshot).  The  hourly  rate  is  calculated  for  each  employee  based  on  ‘ordinary  pay’ 

which includes basic pay, allowances and shift premium pay.  

  With the adopted of AfC national terms and conditions, the only pay elements that fall under 

the  bonus  criteria  are  distinct  awards  such  as  Golden  Hello,  Recruitment  and  Retention 

premiums,  Refer  a  friend  and  One-off  payments  awarded  for  the  completion  of  specific 

duties.  

  The percentage variance for the average hourly  rate of pay is 2.2%. The calculation is based 

on  the  average  hourly  rate  of  661  female  co-owners  compared  to  67  male  co-owmers; 

because  the  average  calculated  in  over  different  numbers  of  employees  (there  are  9  times 

more female co-owners), some mariginal variance is expected.  

  The percentage variance for the bonus hourly rate of pay is just under 30%. While this may 

seem  high,  the  staff  group  considered  in  this  section  were  40  co-owners,  who  are 

predominantly female ( 39 co-owners). The pay elements that are used in this calculation are 

mainly awarded against professional groups and as a mechanism to attract skilled workforce 

to the Organisation – the principles applied have no gender bias. As such, the relevance of 

this indicator is less significant to CSH.

Key points / findings:  

  The  median  hourly  rate  of  pay  is  calculated  from  a  specific  pay  report,  in  this  case  it  is 

March 2017 (snapshot). The median rate is calculated by selecting the average hourly rate 

at the mid-point for each gender group.  

  As with the median hourly rate, the median bonus rate is based on the mid point of all staff 

receiving the bonus pay.  

  The percentage variance for the median hourly rate of pay is 7.9%. For CSH Surrey, this is 

more indicative than the average houly  rate of pay as it is not impacted as much by the 

gender  ratio.  When  considering  this  variance  the  various  factors  need  to  be  taken  into 

account –  

•  The variety of roles within the organisation; and  

•  Progression  within  the  banding  is  based  on  length  of  service  (rather  than 

performance)  

The above factors coupled with the high proportion of  female workforce may represent a 

higher median rate of pay for the female workforce.  

  There  appears  to  be  no  difference  in  the  median  average  of  bonus  pay.  This  again  is 

reflective of the bases on which such payments are made – the principles for which have 

no gender bias.

       Key points / findings:  

  This calculation demomstrates the number of co-owners receiving bonus as a percentage 

to the total headcount in each gender group.  

  For the purposes of calculating bonus, the following payments have been included 

•  Golden Hello 

•  Refer a Friend payment  

•  Recruitment and Retention premium  

•  One-off payments awarded for the completion of specific duties 

  CSH  Surrey  has  clear  guidelines  and  principles  that  govern  majority  of  the  above, 

thus  minimising  any  scope  for  gender  bias.  In  addition,  majority  of  the  above  are 

recruitment / retention initiatives developed to attract skilled workforce to CSH Surrey. 

This  coupled  with  the  high  proportion  of  female  workforce  makes  this  indicator  less 

significant to CSH Surrey.

       Key points / findings:  

 

In order to create the quartile information the entire workforce is sorted by their hourly rate 

of pay, which is then split into 4 equal parts.  

  When  reviewing  the  quartile  information,  it  is  important  to  take  into  account  the  types  of 

roles  available  within  the  organisation  and  the  different  gender  split  that  occurs  within 

specific  roles  e.g.    the  nursing  workforce  in  general  always  has  a  greater  proportion  of 

female employees.  

  The  highest  variances  for  the  quartiles  when  compared  to  overall  data,  are  in  the  Lower 

Quartile and Lower Middle Quartile.  

  The Lower quartile has a high proportion of female co-owners. Included in this quartile are 

admin and ancillary co-owners that have a higher proportion of female co-owners which is 

reflected in the calculation.  

  Lower middle quartile has the highest represenation of male co-owners when compared to 

the other quartiles. Also Included  in  this are the first group of qualified clinical co-owners, 

which include a fair proportion of male co-owners.  

  The  Upper  middle  quartile  and  the  Upper  quartile  have  similar  representation  for  both 

female and male co-owners.

The calculation is based on 

661 female co-owners and 67 

male co-owners. Given the 
average is calculated over 

different  numbers, the 

variance if expected 

The variety of roles along a 

large female workforce with an 
increment scheme linked to the 

length of service may 
represent the variation. 

The group considered included 
40 co-owners – 39 female and 

applying the ‘bonus’ there is 
minimal scope for gender bias 

There appears to be no 
difference in the median 
average of bonus pay. 

As outlined for point 3, 

standard approach adopted 
when applying the ‘bonus’ 
there is minimal scope for 

gender bias.  

The proportion is 

representative of the nature of 

likely posts held within each 
quartile however it appears 
that the proportion of male co-
owners progressing to the next 
quartile is less – this will need 

to be further explored.  

As  outlined    previously,  across  the  NHS  and  other  organisations  within  the  care  sector,  the 

traditional model of care is perceived as a female activity. The workforce representation at CSH is 

no different with a high proportion of female workforce - 90.8%. This difference in this gender split 

is reflective through each of the above outcome areas.
