GENDER  
PAY 
GAP  

Carter Jonas recognise that diversity  
is important to any organisation’s culture 
and fosters an environment which 
increases productivity and performance 
and supports all employees to fulfil their 
potential. The Property sector has not 
traditionally been associated with the 
image of a diverse workforce. The  
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(RICS) recognises this and in 2015 
introduced the Inclusive Employer Quality 
Mark to which Carter Jonas has signed 
up. We are committed to improving 
gender balance within our firm, and to 
ensure we are inclusive and open to 
diversity within our culture.

PAY & BONUS GAP 
The Gender Pay Gap data concerns female representation in roles at 
different levels within the firm and measures the difference between men 
and women’s average earnings across the entire organisation, irrespective of 
role or job grade.  
The table below shows our mean and median gender pay gap and bonus 
gap at the snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017 for pay and in the  12 months 
reference period to 5 April 2017 for bonus).

Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that it is largely driven by the fact 
there are more men in senior roles within the business, with most of the lower 
paid administrative roles being filled by women. This is illustrated by the Pay 
Quartiles chart below which shows  gender distribution across Carter Jonas. 

EQUAL PAY
The Gender Pay Gap is often confused with Equal Pay. Carter Jonas is 
confident that men and women within the business are paid equally when in 
the same roles. We undertake an Equal Pay Audit as part of the salary review 
process. This audit is conducted annually to inform the salary review decision 
making process and acts as a sense check. Any unjustifiable differences are 
addressed as part of that process.

sized quartiles.

GENDER PAY GAP
Whilst we are confident that our pay 
is fair and equitable for men and 
women in the same or similar roles, 
we recognise the need to reduce the 
Gender Pay Gap across the firm. The vast 
majority of people in administration and 
support roles which are paid less than 
professional roles, are female. Conversely, 
the majority of people within the most 
senior roles in the Firm are male, albeit 
this is slowly changing. This is reflective 
of the Surveying Industry, where RICS 
reported just 14% of their members are 
female, compared to 34% of Carter Jonas 
professional Surveyors. In order to drive 
true change at Carter Jonas, our business 
leaders will build upon equality and 
diversity policies, sharing and evolving 
best practice across Recruitment, 
Retention, Learning and Development 
and Talent Pipeline Management. We 
have therefore implemented an action 
plan which is detailed below. 

ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS 
THE GENDER PAY GAP
Increasing gender diversity has been a 
focus at Carter Jonas for a number of 
years; however, it has become a bigger 
issue in the public eye in recent years. 
The reported mean and median pay 
gap, in conjunction with the pay quartile 
data, indicates a gender imbalance in our 
senior roles as the difference between 
the number of males and females at 
each grade is significant. Until there is a
