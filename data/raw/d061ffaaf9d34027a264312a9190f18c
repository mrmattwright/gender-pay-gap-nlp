Ringtons Limited 2017 Gender Pay Report

Pay and Bonus Gap

Hourly pay

Mean
14.50%

Median

12.74%
91.82%

The above table shows our mean and medium hourly gender pay gap and bonus gap as at the
snapshot date (5 April 2017 for pay and 12 months to 5 April 2017 for Bonus)

There is a significant difference in Bonus pay which is attributable to commission paid to our sales
team, which is predominantly male, being identified as Bonus pay under The Equality Act 2010
(Gender Pay Gap Information). Commission is paid monthly and so results in a much larger
proportion of employee 'Bonus'

then Company annual bonus payments.

At Ringtons we are confident that our men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs
across the business. We endeavour to identify and address any gaps and to make sure our policies
are fair.
