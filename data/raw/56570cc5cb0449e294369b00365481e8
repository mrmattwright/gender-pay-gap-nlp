Executive Summary 
 
1.  The purpose of this report is to: 

 

Legislation 

 

Legislation 
 

•  Report on the Trust’s gender pay gap, as required by Gender Pay Reporting 

•  Provide narrative and analysis on the figures required by the Gender Pay Reporting 

TB2018.31 

•  Promote discussion at Board about the Trust’s gender pay gap and the actions that 

should be taken to address it 

 

gap.   

•  Provide initial suggestions for actions to enable the Trust to address the gender pay 

 
2.  The Gender Pay Reporting Legislation requires organisations to publish figures relating 
to their pay gap on an annual basis, and against a prescribed methodology which looks 
at mean and median gender pay gaps.  The pay gap is not the same as equal pay, 
which is a legal requirement.  So, for example, an organisation would have a gender 
pay gap if a higher proportion of men are in top jobs compared to women, despite 
paying male and female employees the same amount for similar roles. 

 
 
3.  The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for 
men and women.  According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), across the UK, 
men earned 18.4% more than women in April 2017.  Below are the figures for OUH as 
of March 31st 2017: 

 

 

 

 

•  For ordinary pay, the mean and median pay gaps are 25.97% and 10.89% in favour 

of men, respectively. 

•  For bonus pay (which is largely driven by additional payments to consultant 

doctors), the mean and median pay gaps are 64.29% and 74.47% in favour of men, 
respectively. 

 

•  2.57% of women and 7.79% of men received bonus pay within the last 12 months. 

•  The distribution of men and women within each quartile of the pay structure is as 

follows (Q1 being low and Q4 being high), showing that there are nearly double the 
proportion of men compared to women in the highest paid roles:

4.  Analysis has identified some key findings and reasons for the gaps noted in the above 

figures. These are: 
 
•  The Trust has a higher proportion of men in more senior positions within the Trust. 

This has a disproportionate impact on the mean pay gaps reported. 
 

•  Analysis of gaps within pay bands show that women could be staying within pay 
bands longer and suggests that more could be done to help women progress in 
their careers. 

•  Bonus pay is largely driven by additional payments to consultant doctors, and given 
that a relatively high proportion of consultant doctors are men, this creates a larger 
gap. 
 

•  The NHS’s national pay structure - Agenda for Change - is effective in ensuring that 

staff in equivalent roles get paid equally, regardless of gender.  
 

Actions are recommended to investigate issues that have been highlighted as a result of 
this report. These are detailed in Appendix 1.  
 
5.  The Board is asked to: 

 
•  Note the contents of this report, and its implications; 
 
•  Discuss how to effectively communicate the findings and the subsequent actions; 

 

 

 

•  Review and agree the high level action plan in Appendix 1.

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Progress Report  

1.  Purpose 

 

1.1.  The purpose of this report is to: 

 

 

1.1.1.  Report  on  the  Trust’s  gender  pay  gap  as  required  by  Gender  Pay 

Reporting Legislation; 

 
1.1.2.  Provide narrative and analysis on the figures required by the Gender Pay 

Reporting Legislation for the Board; 
 

the actions that should be taken; 
 

disparities noted within the report.  

1.1.3.  Promote discussion at the Board about the Trust’s gender pay gap and 

1.1.4.  Provide  recommendations  and  actions  to  investigate  and  address  any 

2.  Background 

 

2.1.  As  of 6  April  2017,  UK  employers  with  more  than 250  staff  are  required  by  law  to 
publish figures relating to their pay gap on an annual basis with the first set of figures 
due by 31 March 2018 for public sector organisations. 

 

2.2.  The report requires organisations to publish the following figures: 

 
2.2.1.  Gender Pay Gap (mean and median averages); 

2.2.2.  Gender Bonus Gap (mean and median averages); 

2.2.3.  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses; 

2.2.4.  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay 

 

 

 

structure. 
 

2.3.  Organisations  must  publish  these  figures  with  a  written  statement  on  their  public-

facing website and report their data to the government through an online service. 

 
2.4.  Within the Trust, pay for most staff adheres to Agenda for Change (AfC). AfC is the 
national pay system for NHS Staff, with the exception of doctors, dentists and very 
senior managers.  

 
2.5.  AfC is designed to ensure equal pay for work of equal value and creates bandings 
which jobs are matched to, based on set criteria. Within pay bands, there is annual 
pay progression along Spine Points.  

 
2.6.  The  Trust  has  a  job  matching  lead  to  ensure  that  all  roles  within  the  Trust  are 

correctly and fairly allocated to a pay banding.

3.  Gender Pay Gap Figures 
 
3.1.  The below tables (1-4) detail the figures that must be published by organisations as 

TB2018.31 

per the Gender Pay Reporting Legislation.  
 

3.2.  These figures have been compiled using a report created by IBM that draws on data 
kept on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR). A snapshot of the data held on 31 March 
2017 has been used as required by legislation; for bonus pay the 12 months prior to 
31 March 2017 was taken into account.  
 

3.3.  Examples of bonus pay would include:  

 

 

Clinical Excellence Awards, which are made to those consultant doctors to 
who are judged to have contributed most towards the delivery of safe and 
high quality care to patients and to the continuous improvement 
of NHS services. 
Discretionary Points for non-training grade doctors (e.g., staff grades and 
associate specialists), which can be awarded in recognition of skills and 
expertise beyond what would normally be expected of the grade  

3.4.  Pay  gaps  are  reported  as  the  relative  percentage  difference  between  men’s  and 
women’s earnings. A positive percentage difference indicates that on average men 
are  paid  higher  and  a  negative  percentage  difference  indicates  that  on  average 
women are paid higher. All percentages have been rounded to give whole numbers.

4.  Narrative and Analysis 
 
Ordinary Pay 
 
4.1.  Looking  first  at  ordinary  pay,  Table  1  shows  that  when  using  the  mean  as  an 
average, men are paid 26% more than women in the Trust. This is significantly larger 
than the median pay gap at 11%. A large gap between the two indicates that there 
are  a  small  number  of  men  in  more  senior  positions  which  has  a  disproportionate 
effect on the results.  
 

4.2.  When  comparing  the  Trust’s  median  pay  gay  to  the  national  median  pay  gap  of 
9.1%1,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  Trust’s  gap  is  higher  than  the  national  average. 
However, when comparing with just public sector organisations, the Trust’s pay gap 
is below the median average of 13.1%.  
 

4.3.  When the information from Tables 1 and 4 is taken together it can be demonstrated 
that one of the key reasons behind the overall disparity seen within the Trust is the 
relative gender distribution within the organisation; with a higher  proportion of men 
within higher-paid positions. Consideration should be given as to why this is taking 
place, especially given that the workforce is 75.7% female. This issue is not unique to 
this  Trust  and  there  have  been  reports  that  show  that  lack  of  women  in  senior 
positions is an NHS-wide issue.2

Table 5: Mean and median gender pay gap for ordinary pay by AfC banding3 

TB2018.31 

4.4.  Table 5 shows pay gaps within each of the AfC bandings. The lower bandings (1-7) 
show a slight pay gap in favour of women which is a different picture than the Trust 
as a whole. It is when looking at the bandings above this that there is a shift towards 
a  pay  gap  in  favour  of  men;  especially  within  Band  9,  Medical,  and  Very  Senior 
Managers (VSM).  

 
4.5.  Regarding  bands  which  demonstrate  a  negative  pay  gap,  where  average  pay  for 
women is higher than men, these differences could be indicative of women remaining 
within a pay band for longer than men as they would move up AfC spine points within 
the band, thereby earning more whilst remaining within the same pay band. Whilst 
this  could  appear  to  be  a  positive  finding    for  women,  it  may  also  be  driven  by  a 
slower rate of of progression for women within the Trust which would be a cause for 
concern.   

 
4.6.  The pay gaps between individual bands are much lower than the overall Trust gap. 
Again, this demonstrates how the overall figure is due to the relatively high proportion 
of  men in more senior roles which is the major driver of the overall result. Also, this 
helps  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  AfC  in  ensuring  that  people  are  paid 
equally  for  work  of  equal  value.  Previous  work  conducted  by  the  Trust  has 
demonstrated  how  AfC  helps  the Trust  to achieve  equal pay  when  removing  other 
factors that could impact pay such as length of service.

4.7.  When looking specifically at the pay gaps split by staff groups in Table 6, it can be 
seen there  are  two  specific  groups  where  the  gaps  are  largest; Administrative  and 
Clerical, and Medical and Dental.  
 

4.8.  The gap in administrative and clerical is explained by the majority of senior managers 
in the Trust being classified within this group. Like the overall Trust results, the mean 
gap is significantly higher than the median gap which would be due to the impact of a 
relatively small number of male senior managers. 
 

4.9.  Regarding the Medical and Dental staff group, the mean and median gaps are similar 
which would indicate that the pay gaps are fairly consistent across the whole group. 
Mean make up 54% of this staff group, which has the highest levels of pay. 
 

4.10. The  pay  gaps  seen  within  the  Medical  and  Dental  group  are  not  unique  to  OUH. 
Nationwide,  it  is  reported  that  senior  female  consultants  earn  less  than  their  male 
counterparts; with it recently reported that out of the top 100 earning consultants in 
England, five are women4.

Bonus Pay 
 
4.11. As stated above, bonus pay includes multiple elements such as clinical excellence 
awards,  discretionary  points,  bonus  payments  and  distinction  awards.    Table  2 
outlines there is a bonus pay gap in favour of men with a mean gap of 64% and a 
median  gap  of  75%.  Table  3  shows  that,  whilst  fewer  than  10%  of  staff  received 
bonus  pay  within  the  12  month  period,  a  significantly  higher  percentage  of  men 
received bonus pay than women.

4.12. Table 7 demonstrates how the Medical and VSM AfC bands have a disproportionate 
impact on the Trust’s overall bonus pay gap due to the larger sums being awarded at 
those levels. In addition, men are disproportionately represented within these higher 
paid bands which further impacts the overall bonus averages.  

 
4.13. The  bonus  pay  awarded  within  the  VSM  pay  band  includes  executives.  From 
financial year 2017-18 onwards, Executives no longer receive bonus payments so it 
is expected that the gap within this band would be reduced for next year; especially 
considering that majority of those receiving these bonuses are men. 
 

4.14. Bands  2,  5,  and  6  show  a  pay  gap  in  favour  of  women.  Healthcare  assistant  and 
nursing roles fall within these bands and are roles primarily filled by women within the 
Trust.

4.15. Analysis of this data by staff group again highlights that senior management (in the 
administrative  and  clerical  group)  and  the  medical  and  dental  group  have  the 
greatest impact on the overall figures. The gaps within these groups are again likely 
to be caused by the relative seniority of men and women within these groups.  
 

4.16. Nursing and Midwifery Registered and Additional Clinical Services show a pay gap in 
favour  of  women,  which  is  to  be  expected  due  to  the  much  higher  proportion  of 
women within these groups and the relative seniority of women within this group as 
compared to men.

5.  Conclusion 

 

5.1.  This  report  highlights  that  there  are  specific  areas  within  the  organisation  that  are 

having a large impact on the organisations overall pay gap. These include: 
 

5.1.1.  Senior Management 

5.1.2.  Medical and Dental staff 
 

women within the organisation.  
 

5.2.  The  report  also  highlights  a  potential  concern  regarding  the  career  progression  of 

5.3.  In light of the issues raised in this report a number of actions have been identified 
and discussed at Trust Management Executive (February 2018). From this a high-
level action plan has been produced which aims to mitigate these issues. This action 
plan can be found in Appendix 1. 

6.  Recommendations 
 
6.1.  The Board is asked to: 

 

 
 

6.1.1.  Note the contents of this report; 

6.1.2.  Discuss how to effectively communicate this work in the public domain; 

6.1.3.  Note and agree the high-level action plan in Appendix 1.
