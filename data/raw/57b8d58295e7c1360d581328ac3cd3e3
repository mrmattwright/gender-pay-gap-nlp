under  GENDER PAY GAP , RAPP , UK , GPG     RAPP UK SHARES A 2018 REPORT ON ITS GENDER PAY GAP     There shouldn’t be a gender pay gap. That’s the long and short of it. Unfortunately it’s clear that there is still a long way to go in the UK to close that gap, and at RAPP we are absolutely committed to playing our part in reducing it. RAPP’s gender pay gap, as of April 2017, is 23.1%. We were both surprised and disappointed with this figure which we don’t feel reflects our culture or beliefs. However, the analysis behind the report has helped us to identify and understand where the pay gap is coming from, which means we can take action to tackle it. I hope that, as businesses across the UK respond to the gender pay gap report, we will see a collective response that not only addresses this at individual company levels but drives wider cultural and societal change for the better. -Chris Freeland, CEO, RAPP UK To read RAPP’s full report, you can download it  here .
