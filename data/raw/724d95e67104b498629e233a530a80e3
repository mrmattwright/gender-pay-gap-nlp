The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings.  At HMSHost UK we believe in transparency- One of our company values is ‘Be Open’- and we welcome the legislation which encourages every business to identify areas where we can do better, and to work towards eliminating the gender pay gap altogether.  To find out more, please find our gender pay gap report below. I confirm that the Gender Pay data provided for HMSHost UK Ltd below are accurate and have been produced in accordance with the guidelines.
