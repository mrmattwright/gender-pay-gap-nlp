We believe that the best results are
achieved by great people from diverse
backgrounds, ethnicities, and gender. 

The Company is proud of its rapid
development from a largely Scottish
business to a modern international
organisation where diversity of thought 
is encouraged. The internationalisation 
of Edrington means 66% of employees 
are based in overseas locations, with
offices in 16 locations. 

In this report we focus on gender, specifically pay
gap information for our UK businesses. This first
disclosure sets out the current gender pay gap,
explains the context of the results, and maps out
the actions for further progress.
The headline results of a 25.5% mean pay
differential and a 73.3% mean bonus differential,
and an 9.8% median pay differential and an 11.8%
median bonus differential, fall short of our ambition
and do not yet reflect progressive improvement
actions, which have been in place over a number 
of years. 
Over the last year the company’s recruitment
activity has driven a 50-50 gender split across 
92 recruits with a greater portion of females
recruited to managerial graded roles.
Development and coaching has also reflected the
changing profile of the company. Our Emerging
Talent programme selects candidates for
accelerated development who will become future
business leaders. In the last year 57% of the 28
candidates have been female.
In time, and in conjunction with other initiatives,
these actions will impact results. We are committed
to narrowing and then closing the pay gap.

Measuring the pay gap

The gender pay gap shows 
the difference in average pay
between women and men. It
does not measure equal pay,
which relates to what women 
and men are paid for the same 
or similar jobs or work of equal
value. We review our pay
practices annually to ensure that
we are an equal pay employer.

Calculating the numbers
Under the UK Government’s new
Gender Pay Gap regulation,
companies need to report their
gender pay gap for all legal
entities in Great Britain with
more than 250 employees.

The Edrington Group, known
simply as Edrington, employs
approximately 840 people across
two legal entities in Great Britain
covered by the regulations: 
The Edrington Group Ltd (558)
and Edrington Group (Highland)
Ltd (278).

Edrington Group (Highland) Ltd
is a subsidiary that encompasses
the brand businesses acquired
by Edrington when it purchased
Highland Distillers in 1999.

This report shares the mean
(average) and median pay gaps
between men and women’s
hourly pay and bonuses.

What is the mean?
The mean is the average,
it’s calculated by adding
all numbers in a set
together and dividing 
by the total number of
terms in the set.

What is the median?
The median is the
middle term in a set of
numbers, it’s calculated
by arranging the
numbers in a set in 
order of magnitude 
and determining the
middle value.

Understanding 
the pay gap

The mean gender pay gap for
employees across our businesses
is 25.5%, +7.8 percentage points
versus the Office of National
Statistics (ONS) Great Britain
mean of 17.7%.

The mean bonus pay gap is
73.3% and is also heavily
influenced by the greater
proportion of men than women
occupying senior leadership
roles that include bonus pay.

The Company operates a
longstanding share reward
scheme for all UK employees
with six months service. This all
employee bonus scheme is
contingent upon Edrington
achieving financial performance
targets. As this is a free share
scheme, it is not reflected in 
the bonus figures.*

The gap is primarily driven by
more men currently occupying
senior leadership roles.

Over the next five years we
expect to see a significant
increase in the number of
females in senior leadership
roles. This will be achieved
through a number of actions,
such as our commitment to 
focus investment on continuing
development programmes 
and recruiting more females 
into managerial roles.

Closing the gap

Our aim is to close the gender pay
gap and we already have in place a
number of strategies which will
continue to narrow the gap.

Recruitment
Our recruitment approach is to
attract the greatest numbers of
female candidates for each role
without sacrificing our belief in
appointing the best candidate
for the role. We aim to achieve 
a 50:50 candidate split for roles.

Similarly, the Company’s
graduate recruitment scheme
aims for gender balance.

In the past year Edrington has
invested in its employer brand,
notably through an active
presence in digital media.
Greater openness about
available roles and wider
awareness of the Company’s
values are key steps towards
more diverse recruitment.

Leadership Development
We will continue to provide
development programmes 
and high quality mentoring for
women. The Emerging Talent
programme focusses on those

with leadership potential, 
whilst the LEAD programme
concentrates on those already 
in leadership positions.

The company’s long running
mentor scheme and the relatively
new Edrington Academy provide
tailored inputs to help female
employees progress.

We will aim for an equal gender
split for internal successors to
senior leadership roles.

Maternity and Paternity
We will continue to help
employees who experience a
change in their lifestyle, e.g. start
or grow a family, to best adapt to
that change through maternity,
paternity and parental leave. We
will also look into phased return
programmes and coaching to
support a successful transition
back to work for parents.

Encouraging women into STEM
We will work with schools and
universities to influence the
uptake of STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, 
and Mathematics) subjects 
and promote Edrington as 
an employer of these skills. 
This will make it easier for 
future candidates to access 
the increasing number of 
STEM-based roles within our
Operations and Technology
functions. 

Informal networks
Edrington has encouraged the
creation of Balance, a network 
of female employees, where
gender issues can be discussed
and peer groups can coach and
mentor each other.

The Company is also building 
a network of external speakers
offering employees the
opportunity to broaden 
their perspective.

Summary

Edrington is well tuned to the positive influence
that diversity can have on its business. 

The results in this inaugural gender pay gap
report lag behind our progressive ambition 
but we are confident that current and future
programmes will improve this position and 
allow all employees to thrive.
