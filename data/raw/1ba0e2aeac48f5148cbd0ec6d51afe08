The businesses are end-to-end with a variety of different departments and associated roles with the expectation of a difference in skills, qualifications and experience required to carry out those roles.  With these differences brings differences in the market rate for pay across those roles and departments.  From a gender mix perspective, we employ 76% male and 24% female employees.    Pay  The relatively few females employed in roles within the highest earning roles drives the percentage associated with the pay gap.  Only 24% of our employees are female with only 1 female appearing in the top 20 highest salaried employees.  Where we have male and female employees carrying out the same role, they are broadly paid the same.    Closing summary  We commit to ensuring that our recruitment and succession planning processes identify and encourage females to progress within the business and give them the appropriate training in order to enable them to progress.  GI Solutions and GI Insight employ and value a diverse group of employees and do not discriminate against any employees whatever their background or beliefs in either recruitment, selection, training, promotion or pay. GI Solutions and GI Insight have robust policies and processes in place in order to communicate, train and manage to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and consistently.  Where any breaches of its policies are identified, GI Solutions and GI Insight will continue to take appropriate steps to deal with the breach.
