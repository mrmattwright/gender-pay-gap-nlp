OUR
GENDER PAY 
REPORT
COMPASS GROUP UK

Foreword

Compass Group UK’s median gender pay gap is 12.3%*, which is 
better than the UK’s median gender pay gap of 18.2%**. However, 
we recognise that there is more we can do.

Our gender pay gap reflects the average paid to men and women 
across our UK business. It is not a comparison of pay rates for 
men and women doing work of equal value.

While women make up the majority of our UK workforce and a 
significant proportion of senior positions, more of our most senior 
(and therefore highest-paid) people are currently male, a factor 
that influences both our gender pay and bonus gaps.

At Compass Group, we are committed to the diversity and 
inclusion agenda. You can read more about what we are doing to 
address our gender pay and bonus gaps on pages 4-5.

I look forward to reporting on our progress in a year’s time.

*The median figure is the middle point of a number 
set, in which half of the numbers are above and half 
are below. This is different to the mean, which is 
the sum of all the numbers in the set, divided by the 
amount of numbers in the set.

Addressing Our Gender Pay Gap
As part of a number of diversity and inclusion initiatives, our 
award-winning Women in Food programme aims to attract more 
women to this exciting and diverse industry*.
Through this we want to:
• Attract more female chefs and support their development;
• Provide more opportunities for women to progress into senior 
positions and increase the proportion of women on our senior 
leadership team; and

• Enhance the support we provide to parents returning to work 

after parental and adoption leave.

Here are some examples of our work in this area.

*Winner - Best Initiative to Retain and Develop Women, 2017 Shine Awards; Winner - Best 
Diversity Initiative, 2017 Caterer.com People Awards.

More female chefs
Compass Group UK & Ireland employs just under 4,500 chefs. 
35% of them are female. This is far higher than the average 
representation of women in chef roles across the UK.* We want to attract 
even more women into chef roles with us and support their career 
progression.
Our Women in Food Ambassadors Network, made up of eight of our 
female chefs, plays an important role in helping us to achieve this. As 
well as working externally to inspire more women to consider a career 
as a chef, our Ambassadors also support the needs of our female chefs 
across the business through mentoring and career support.

Women in leadership
We have developed a programme to support the progression of more 
women into senior leadership roles within our business.
The programme has been designed so that mentors from our senior 
leadership team can help cohorts better navigate the areas that can 
affect a woman’s career development.

Supporting our working parents
We have developed resources to support our people who are expecting 
or adopting a child – as well as their managers. Our Maternity, Paternity, 
Adoption and Shared Parental Leave guides are designed to support 
employees as they prepare to take leave, during their time away from the 
workplace and in helping ensure a smooth return back to work.

Flexible working
Many of our people, including some of our senior colleagues, work part-
time or flexible hours. We are positive about exploring different ways 
of working because it helps us attract and keep the best people in the 
business.

Case Study

Gemma Evans
Executive Chef & Women in Food Ambassador

I have worked for Compass Group for 
nearly eight years. I love working here 
because it’s an organisation which 
offers growth to employees who are 
hungry for new adventures. 
Working in the Education sector, my 
day job can involve anything from 
reviewing menus to organising tasting 
sessions and training up the next 
generation of chefs. I love my job 
because I can see the value of what I 
add to the lives of future generations.
In addition to my day job, I have 
also taken part in international 
competitions, including the World 
Culinary Olympics in 2012, where I 
was the only female chef in the UK to 
win a gold medal, and again in 2016, 
where I won a bronze medal and was 

the only female chef in the British 
team. 
I was also very proud to be shortlisted 
for Chef of the Year at the 2017 
Shine Awards, which celebrate 
the contribution of women to the 
hospitality, leisure and catering 
industries.
I am now excited to be part of 
the Women in Food Board and 
Ambassador Programme, where I 
hope we can encourage more women 
into our industry as well as supporting 
the successful career pathways of 
female chefs.
