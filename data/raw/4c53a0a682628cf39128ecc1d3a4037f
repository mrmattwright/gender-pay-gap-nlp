The results are expressed as a percentage of the value for male colleagues.  It’s important to remember that the gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay.  Equal pay concerns pay differences between individuals or groups performing the same or similar work . Comparatively, the gender pay gap is concerned with differences in the average earnings of men and women, regardless of their role or seniority.  Gender pay gap is therefore a broader measure; capturing not simply equal pay within an organization but also any pay variations resulting from differences in the sorts of jobs performed by men and women and the gender composition of the work force by seniority.  Organisations with a higher proportion of men in senior roles and women in junior roles will ultimately have a larger gender pay gap. Irrespective of whether an employer has eliminated unequal pay, they may still have a wide gender pay gap. Ultimately, in any business the causes of a gender pay gap can be varied and complex and can be outside the control of any one employer. There are many contributing factors including working hours and the number of men and women in different roles across a business.  As a business that puts families first, we also understand that women are much more likely to take time out of their career for family reasons, ultimately slowing the pace at which they typically progress to more senior and better paid roles.

The hourly rate includes elements such as basic pay, shift premiums, allowances and incentive vouchers which were paid as of 5th April 2017. Elements such as overtime and expenses are not included.  What is the Mean Hourly Rate?  This is the average hourly rate of pay.  What is the Median Hourly Rate?  This is the hourly rate of pay which falls at the mid-point of all rates paid.  Results  The results below reflect the fact that we have a significant number of women in senior roles such as department heads and management positions. We are proud to say that 51% of management roles are held by women.   Women's Hourly rate is    2.3 %   Higher  (mean)     4.8 %   Higher  (median)       Pay Quartiles  What are Pay Quartiles?  The hourly rates for all colleagues are divided into four equal sections where the Lower Quartile represents the lowest hourly rates and the Top Quartile highlights the highest hourly rates. The proportion of men and women in each quartile is then calculated.  The results below represent the number of women in senior management positions across the business.   The pay quartiles show the proportion of men and women that make up each pay banding   Top Quartile       43.5%   Men       56.5%   Women    Upper Middle Quartile       41.8%   Men       58.2%   Women    Lower Middle Quartile       30.0%   Men       70.0%   Women    Lower Quartile       62.0%   Men       38.0%   Women       Bonus Pay  How is Mean Bonus Pay Calculated?  This is the average bonus pay.  How is Median Bonus Pay Calculated?  This is the bonus pay which falls at the mid-point of all bonuses paid.  The results below reflect the gender composition within our senior management team. Whilst we have more women than men in department head roles, there are more men at director level. Therefore, historical bonus schemes based on percentages of pay resulted in higher levels of bonus payments being made to men.   Women's bonus pay     18.3 %   Lower  (mean)    25.2 %   Higher  (median)    Who received bonus pay       34.8%   Of Men       22.8%   Of Women       Closing the gap  We know that we have work to do to close our gender pay gap specifically in relation to bonus pay. To ensure this happens we will continue to support and encourage female colleagues to develop their careers and progress to senior positions, particularly at director level within our business. To this end, we currently have a project in place which involves training all senior managers to promote equality and diversity in the workplace. In the meantime, we actively encourage women to advance in the business and we are proud to say that 55% of colleagues promoted in the 16/17 financial year were female.

This is the hourly rate of pay which falls at the mid-point of all rates paid.  Results  The results below reflect that as a family orientated retailer we attract a significant number of female applicants, especially for our store roles. These positions are appealing to women due to the flexible working patterns available, which no doubt suit their lifestyle choices. In fact 91% of our store based colleagues are female. The majority of our retail roles are sales consultant positions, which are lower paid than management roles. This inevitably means we have a large number of women in lower paid jobs. Despite that, 91% of our supervisors are female and 76% of our managers are female which demonstrates that we have a clear progression path in place regardless of gender.   Women's Hourly rate is     34.4 %   Lower  (mean)     11.1 %   Lower  (median)      Pay Quartiles  What are Pay Quartiles?  The hourly rates for all colleagues are divided into four equal sections where the Lower Quartile represents the lowest hourly rates and the Top Quartile highlights the highest hourly rates. The proportion of men and women in each quartile is then calculated.  The results are representative of the fact that whilst the vast majority of our colleagues are female we do have a significant number of women in management roles. In fact the percentages for women across all quartiles is very high purely down to the majority of colleagues being female.   The pay quartiles show the proportion of men and women that make up each pay banding   Top Quartile       22.8%   Men       77.2%   Women    Upper Middle Quartile       11.3%   Men       88.7%   Women    Lower Middle Quartile       5.5%   Men       94.5%   Women    Lower Quartile       11.5%   Men       88.5%   Women       Bonus Pay  How is Mean Bonus Pay Calculated?  This is the average bonus pay.  How is Median Bonus Pay Calculated?  This is the bonus pay which falls at the mid-point of all bonuses paid.  Results  We operate a monthly bonus scheme for our store based colleagues based on store performance which is calculated as a percentage of pay using hours worked in a specific reference period. As 75% of our female colleagues work part time, their bonus payments are less than males who tend to work more hours and therefore earn more bonus. A number of senior management colleagues based at Head Office were also paid a bonus based on company performance and this has significantly influenced the numbers.   Women's bonus pay     80.1 %   Lower  (mean)     38.3 %   Lower  (median)   Who received bonus pay       52.0%   Of Men       65.8%   Of Women       Closing the gap  We know that we have work to do to close our gender pay gap.
