Gender pay gap report  
(31 March 2017 snapshot)  

 

 

1.  What is the gender pay gap report? 

Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees from April 
2017 to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between 
their male and female employees. There are two sets of regulations. The first is mainly for 
the private and voluntary sectors (taking effect from 5 April 2017) and the second is mainly 
for the public sector (taking effect from 31 March 2017). Employers will have up to 12 
months to publish their gender pay gaps. 
 
The results must be published on the employer's website and a government website. They 
must, where applicable, be confirmed in a written statement by an appropriate person, such 
as a chief executive. While employers may already be taking steps to improve gender 
equality and reduce or eliminate their gender pay gap, this process will support and 
encourage action. 
 
Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay- equal pay deals with the pay differences 
between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It 
is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. 
 
The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in 
a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there 
may a number of issues to deal with, and the individual calculations may help to identify 
what those issues are. 
 
The NHS terms and conditions of service handbook contain the national agreements on pay 
and conditions of service for NHS staff other than very senior managers and medical staff. 
 
Job evaluation (JE) enables jobs to be matched to national job profiles or allows trusts to 
evaluate jobs locally, to determine in which Agenda for Change pay band a post should sit.  
 

2.  The gender pay gap indicators 

An employer must publish six calculations showing their: 

  Average gender pay gap as a mean average 
  Average gender pay gap as a median average 
  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average 
  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average 
  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving a 

bonus payment 

  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest 

to highest pay.
