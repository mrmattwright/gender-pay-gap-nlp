As a Catholic College for the Community we believe that every individual is important and has the right to be valued, treated with respect and to achieve their full potential.  This commitment applies to all members of the College Community and beyond: Students, Staff, Governors, Visitors and all those we come into contact with. It underpins everything we do and informs our approach to student support systems, teaching, learning and assessment and to our staffing and recruitment policies. In particular, we strive to create an environment which is inclusive and welcoming and which is free from all forms of discrimination. We take positive action wherever we can by promoting the values of inclusivity and mutual respect and by standing firm in the face of discrimination, harassment or bullying.  The Board of Governors, The Principal and the Senior Management Team all acknowledge their responsibility for the active promotion of Equality and Diversity, in particular the protected characteristics defined by the Equality Act 2010. The Single Equality Scheme sets out the College approach and commitment to Equality and Diversity.    Our Equality & Diversity Committee  Our E&D Committee is made up of representatives from the Senior Management Team, teaching staff, support staff, students and the Governing Body. The group meets twice every half term to not only discuss E&D issues that may be affecting the college, but also to find ways to promote E&D throughout the college. Recent achievements include:   All staff have received training on Everyday Sexism and Unconscious Bias  Completed an equality impact assessment relating to STEM subjects at Carmel  All students have received E&D training in their Ethics & Values lessons  An E&D Calendar has been created and uploaded to Connect, our intranet  All staff have been briefed with regards to LGBT issues    Useful links  Carmel's E&D Policy  Gender Pay Gap Report 2018  Equality & Diversity UK  Equality & Diversity Forum    About Us   Principal's Welcome  Mission Statement  Ofsted Inspection  DfE Performance Tables  Term Dates  Open Events  Admissions Information  Study Programme  Exam Results  Life at Carmel  How We Support You  Job Opportunities  Equality & Diversity  Higher Education           Video Gallery  See what life is like at Carmel and hear what our students think       Downloads  Read our Prospectus, courses leaflets and other info leaflets       Facilities Hire  Need facilities for your club, business meeting or event with free car parking on site?
