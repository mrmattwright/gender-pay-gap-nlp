The 14 data points they must declare include their mean and median gender pay gaps, the difference in the average bonuses they pay to men and women, and the share of men and women in each quartile of their wage bills. Lindum Group welcomes the opportunity to benchmark these figures and also sees this as a chance to reiterate the vital work which must be done to close the gender divides which exist within the construction industry. It is no secret that historically, the sector has a predominantly male workforce. Stereotypical media representations of men and women and outdated careers advice for girls have done little to help recruitment of women into the industry. Initiatives which encourage more women into STEM subjects at school and university will go some way to increasing the numbers of talented women into sectors such as construction. In response, it is the responsibility of businesses like Lindum to put in place agile working arrangements, which will enable more women to remain at work or return after career breaks, and progress to senior or technical positions. Lindum has a strong record of promoting women to senior roles; for many years our Group Chair was Mrs Brown. There is still some way to go – in spite of our best efforts, during the second half of last year Lindum received 565 job applications from men yet only 120 from women . However, we are encouraged that our Q3 pay quartile closely mirrors the demographic make-up of our Group, which in turn suggests we are making progress  Click here to download the full report        "From April 2017, companies with more than 250 employees are required by law to publish financial information relating to their gender pay gap."
