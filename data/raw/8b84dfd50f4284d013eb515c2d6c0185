       Home  /            ABF Grain Products Ltd – Gender Pay Gap Report  Heading   The promotion and development of talented people, irrespective of their gender or background, is something about which I care very deeply. I want our employees to realise their full potential. That makes good business sense as well as being the right thing to do. The figures outlined below are accurate and show both the mean and median differential in pay and bonus between genders across ABF Grain Products Ltd as on 5th April 2017. At this date, ABF Grain Products Ltd employed 5,674 people, with 4,566 being male and 1,108 female (about 19% of our workforce.); The ABF Grain Products Ltd mean gender pay gap is -5.7% in favour of women, compared to a UK mean pay gap of 17.4% in favour of men. We are confident that there is no gender bias in the pay we give to men and women who perform the same role. Our data has improved from 2016 to 2017 with both the mean and median gender pay gap figures progressing in favour of women. Women are well represented within our management population, though our Board structures are currently balanced men to women on a ratio of approximately 2:1. We are working on initiatives to support the development of talented women across our organisation, such that more women will move into senior management positions over time.
