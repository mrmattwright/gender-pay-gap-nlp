        Bedford Inclusive Learning and Training Trust, Manor Drive, Kempston Bedford MK42 7AB Tel: 01234 408477 Email: info@biltt.org      Ethos and Culture  Vision  Trust Board              Welcome to our site!  Bedford Inclusive Learning and Training Trust is a first for Bedford.  It brings together three specialist provisions: St Johns Special School and College, Grange Academy and Greys Education Centre.  We want to make specialist provision in Bedford the very best it can be, and this means aiming to be world class. Our Vision is to create a Beacon of Excellence with regard to specialist provision and training that is recognised locally and nationally: we are striving to ensure our young people and families get what they deserve -  the very best.  Our schools provide education for pupils/students with complex and varied cognitive and physical challenges, moderate learning difficulties and those young people who are unable to access mainstream school provision for a period of time - this may be because of an exclusion or a health issue.  We work very closely with our families and a variety of other agencies and organisations to ensure our young people achieve outstanding outcomes and the best life-chances possible.  If you, or your organisation, can support the Trust and its fundraising charity in any way please contact the Executive Principal by e-mail: terry.ashmore@greys.beds.sch.uk  Best wishes   Terry Ashmore Executive Principal       LATEST NEWS  A new free school for children with profound and multiple learning difficulties is set to open in Kempston  Please click here to read more ..
