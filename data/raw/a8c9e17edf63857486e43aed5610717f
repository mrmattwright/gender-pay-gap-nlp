Whilst confident that we have equal pay, we accept we have a gender pay gap. For the combined Hanson UK Business our gender gap pay is 16.3 per cent, lower than the reported UK average of 17.4 per cent. The main reasons for this are that we have fewer women in senior positions and in operational production roles which attract weekly bonuses and shift premiums. You can find out more about the gap and what we are doing to address it here:   Hanson gender pay gap report  (PDF, 3.32 MB)                           Policies Hanson cookie policy  Hanson privacy policy  Hanson terms and conditions of use policy  Insurance policy details  Tax Policy   Customer Service CE mark search  Certificates  Customer portal   Legal Standard conditions of sale  Data protection notice  Trading divisions  Gender pay gap report  Modern slavery statement   Get connected Twitter  Facebook  LinkedIn  Youtube  Google   Our websites  HeidelbergCement
