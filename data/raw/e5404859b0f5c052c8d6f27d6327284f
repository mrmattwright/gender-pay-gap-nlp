We ensure that business practices are socially responsible and environmentally sustainable across the business.   Doing the right thing for the environment and our people forms an integral part of the way we work at BCM.  We support a full CSR programme to ensure we can deliver fantastic products to our customers in an ethical and sustainable way.    Marketplace  BCM is committed to providing consistent and high-quality products to its customers. This requires diverse, class-leading and responsible suppliers who are committed to providing high-quality, innovative, sustainable and value for money products and services throughout our relationship with the supplier.  Workplace  We value our colleagues and have our 'BCM Stars' program, a monthly recognition scheme which recognizes and rewards those who go above and beyond.   The results of our annual 'Your Voice' employee survey in the UK help to build team action plans, so that we address what matters to our colleagues.   Health and safety is also paramount to us and we believe that everyone's behavior contributes to a safe and healthy BCM. We continue to support our people through training and development, so that they can successfully meet the challenges of our industry.
