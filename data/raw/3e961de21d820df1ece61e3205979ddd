One of our core business values is ‘Do The Right Thing’ and we want everyone to have their human rights upheld, whether they are people who work for SACO, on behalf of SACO or with SACO or stay in our SACO properties. We know that this value and stand point is also supported by our guests, customers, colleagues and suppliers.

This consists of:   Asking our new Global Partners to sign a Partner Agreement, confirming their compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Legislation  Ensuring key suppliers are aware of our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Stance, including referring them to our Modern Slavery Statement and asking that they adhere to our statement  Carrying out a risk assessment of our suppliers and taking actions where risks are identified           Training AND COMMUNICATION  To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to our staff where this is identified as a training need. We also ensure the Modern Slavery Statement is communicated Company wide through Line Management. We have an appointed Modern Slavery Compliance Officer who is available to field all queries and reported breaches (both internally and externally).    Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking  We are committed to monitor both the internal compliance and the compliance of our suppliers in relation to Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. Where any concerns are raised these are reported to our Compliance Officer and remedial plans are put in place.
