We hold Investors In Diversity and Investors In People status and are committed to challenging misconceptions about the engineering sector to attract more women into an industry that offers a huge range of exciting opportunities for everyone up to the highest level.  We are therefore proud to support inclusion in the industry including STEM projects and other opportunities such as CIHT’s celebrating women in transport and engineering exhibition at the Think Tank in Birmingham – showcasing women role models across the industry.    This report covers the Government’s gender pay initiative, which compares the average hourly rates of pay of all men and women within every organisation employing more than 250 people. The presence of a gender pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean an employer is paying men and women unequally, but indicates for us that there are fewer women in a range of roles, and this is something we want to work to change.    Many organisations have a gender pay gap, but Eurovia UK’s gap compares favourably with that of other organisations, including those within our industry.  We commit to publishing this type of report annually in March and to demonstrating the improvements we are making year on year.
