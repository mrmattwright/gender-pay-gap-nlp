Goldsmiths, University of London has a statutory duty to report this data to the Government Equalities Office.  All employers in Great Britain (excluding Northern Ireland) with more than 250 member of staff must report this information under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, which require us to report on a number of metrics as of 31st March in a given year.  These metrics are:   Mean gender pay gap  Median gender pay gap  Mean bonus gender pay gap  Median bonus gender pay gap  Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment  Proportion of males and females in each quartile band   The gender pay gap differs from equal pay, which requires that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive the same pay. Both the gender pay gap and equal pay are measurements which address the disparity of pay women receive in the workplace.  While it is a requirement by law that gender pay gap data must be supplied in female and male categories, Goldsmiths recognises that gender is not a binary concept. In future we will consider the best way to include information for staff who identify as non-binary.  The gender pay gap at Goldsmiths  Data as of 31st March 2017 shows:   Mean gender pay gap is 5.65% . This means the average hourly salary of female members of staff is 5.65% lower than the average for male members of staff;  Median gender pay gap is 7.45% . This means the average hourly salary in the middle of our female staff population is 7.45% lower than the equivalent male salary.   Goldsmiths does not have a formal bonus scheme.  Pay profile by quartile     Lower Quartile  Female (56%)  Male (44%)    Lower Middle Quartile  Female (60%)  Male (40%)    Upper Middle Quartile  Female (52%)  Male (48%)    Upper Quartile  Female (48%)  Male (52%)     The overall profile of our staff population on 31st March 2017 was 54% women and 46% men.  How Goldsmiths is addressing the gender pay gap  Goldsmiths aims to advance Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) and we have a highly engaged strategy, Equality Objectives and Action plan, and policies which support embedding EDI into everything that we do.  Our strategy and institutional objectives can be found on our Equality and Diversity pages.  As part of this work the College has a number of initiatives to address pay disparity for women. This includes:   Supporting staff through external women-only leadership development programmes, including the Aurora Women’s Leadership Programme.  Introduction of a Women’s Leadership Network.  Joining the Athena SWAN Charter, and pursuing an award, to help us identify and address any gender equality issues such as around recruitment and selection, academic promotions, pay and progression.  Unconscious bias training for all staff.  Training for staff involved in recruitment to minimise gender bias.   National and local context  Data released by the Office for National Statistics shows that the average mean gender pay gap in the UK is currently 14.1%. The average median gender pay gap is 9.1%.  According to the University and College Union, the average mean gender pay gap for academics is 12%, with the average median gender pay gap 12.2%.  Goldsmiths operates a grade structure based on the New JNCHES single pay scale. Pay in relation to the single pay spine is negotiated nationally. All roles outside of our Senior Management Team and other off the national single pay scale roles are evaluated using the HERA job evaluation scheme.  The HERA scores are mapped to our grading structure to ensure that we remunerate staff fairly for the same role, like work and work of equal value regardless of their role within the institution. This ensures that we comply with the Equality Act 2010 and do not pay people unequally due to a protected characteristic such as their sex.  The grading structure contains a number of spine points within each grade band; and staff are usually appointed to the bottom of the grade band. Under this framework staff who have held a role for a longer period are more highly remunerated within that grade band for their work; and this remuneration reflects the experience that they have gained in undertaking their duties.  Prior to publication these figures have been reported to our Senior Management Team and we will report regularly to our Human Resources and Equalities Committee with regard to work we undertake to close our gender pay gap.  - Page last updated 15 March 2018              What's happening at Goldsmiths      News           Twins in class: 'no evidence' for separation rules  19 Apr 2018            Studying the impact of home musical environment in early childhood  16 Apr 2018       Events            Politics and IR Annual PhD Conference 2018  Conference  23 Apr 2018, 9:30am &dash; 6:00pm             Drone Visions: Mapping, Art, Ethics  Workshop  23 Apr 2018, 6:00pm &dash; 8:00pm                     About us  Accessibility statement  Contact us  Slavery and human trafficking statement  Find us  Cookie policy  Jobs  Copyright and disclaimer   Admin login    Twitter  Linkedin  Facebook  Instagram  YouTube    © Goldsmiths, University of London  Back to top
