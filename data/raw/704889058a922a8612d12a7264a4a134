Bibby Distribution Limited 2017 Gender Pay Report 
 
As part of the Government’s ongoing initiative to address equal pay, it requires all businesses with 
more than 250 employees to publish information relating to its pay for men and women. Guidance 
has been provided as to what and how businesses are to present this information, and this report 
satisfies those legal requirements.  
 
 
A message from Duncan Eyre, Managing Director  
 
Having spent almost twenty years in the logistics sector, I’ve seen plenty of change. The sector is 
evolving, in some areas faster than others. It’s pretty clear that it’s not the most diverse sector, 
and  I’d like to see  that change at Bibby Distribution.  Our values state  that people are the  most 
important part of our business and we need the best people – and we need to look at how we can 
attract more talent from the female population. 
 
When we first started to look at our pay data as part of the government initiative on gender pay, 
probably like many other MD’s, CEO’s and HRD’s, I was curious to see the results.  
 
I am pleased that our approach to pay means that our mean gender pay gap of only 2.29% compares 
more than favourably with the wider UK economy benchmark of 18.1%, and the reported 38% in 
the UK distribution industry.   
 
We  do  apply  the  same  pay  rates  regardless  of  gender  to  the  same  roles  such  as  drivers  and 
warehouse operatives although  we  do have regional  differences influenced by the local market. 
This is borne out in this report. 
 
This report does highlight something that we are already looking at, which is how we encourage 
more women to work for us in our operational roles at our depots.  We do have a number of 
female depot, warehouse and contract managers and we would like to see more. We fare much 
better in the corporate support functions. We have centralised our recruitment activity and this 
will help us to focus on attracting and retaining a more diverse workforce.   
 
I confirm the data reported is accurate.

BDL 

 
As is typical in the distribution 
sector,  the  make-up  of  our 
workforce 
is 
predominately  men  at  87.3%, 
and only 12.7% are women.   
 
The majority of females work in 
non-operational  roles  whereas 
men  work  across  a  broader 
variety  of 
including 
drivers,  warehouse,  support 
functions and management.

Pay Gap 
 
This  graph  shows  the  overall 
difference  between  men  and 
women based on an hourly rate of 
pay. There is a mean difference of 
2.29%  and  a  median  difference  of 
6.84%. 
 
 
 
 
Bonus Pay Gap 
 
There  are  various  bonus  schemes  across  the  workforce  including  an  annual  bonus  for  our 
management and support functions and operational/productivity bonuses to the operational teams 
– which as shown in the first graph above is mostly men.  
 
Looking at the different bonus payments collectively shows that our mean bonus pay gap is only 
0.33%.    However,  our  median  bonus  pay  gap  is  -51.37%  -  so  favourable  to  women  –  which  is 
because  those  women  who  did  receive  a  bonus  participated  in  the  higher  paying  annual  bonus 
scheme.

In  BDL,  many  of  our  roles  are  not 
eligible  for  a  bonus.  However,  the 
graph  shows  that  more  men  than 
women  are  in  roles  that  do  qualify 
for  a  bonus.  In  the  main,  this  is 
because we employ many more men 
than  women,  and  more  men 
progress  into  management  roles 
which qualify for a bonus, specifically 
in the operation where the number 
of women is very low.  
 

 
 
 
Pay Quartiles 
 
The  charts  below  show  the  gender  distribution  across  four  equally  sized  pay  quartiles,  each 
containing just over 460 colleagues.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although we have a higher number of male colleagues throughout the business, the pay gaps within 
the pay quartiles are minimal.   
 
Having completed this analysis, we are satisfied that men and women are paid equally for doing 
equivalent jobs across our business, and this is illustrated in this report.
