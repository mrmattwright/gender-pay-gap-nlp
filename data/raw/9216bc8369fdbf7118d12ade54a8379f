The following figures relate to 5 th April 2017, the snapshot date for the report.  We employ more men (219) than women (41) and the majority of posts in the management team and executive board are held by men.  Our published statistics (registered on the Government’s website and also carried on www.star-ref.co.uk) show that in the top three quarters of our earners (typically technical staff and engineering managers), only 4.6% are women and it is only in the lowest quartile that we achieve parity, with 50.8% male and 49.2% female staff.  The split between male and female staff in the upper quartiles is a fair reflection of the numbers of applications we receive when these posts are advertised and we work hard to ensure that there is no gender bias in salary at all levels of the company.  We also support several initiatives to encourage more girls and women to take up careers in engineering.  In 2017 this included sponsorship of Glasgow University’s FemEng Society and the Women in Engineering Day.  In 2017 Engineering UK reported that there is a shortfall of at least 20,000 candidates per year for both craft and professional engineer posts in the UK and we recognise that reducing the discrepancy between male and female candidates at apprentice and graduate level will be a significant factor in recruiting and retaining skilled staff.    The gender balance in pay quartiles is:   The gender pay gap is:     Difference between men and women      Mean    Median    Hourly fixed pay  41.0%    48.5%    Bonus  52.2%    52.5%     In 2017 96.3% of male staff and 87.8% of female staff received a bonus. The difference is due to eligibility; the bonus is paid in proportion to basic salary and the number of months worked in the preceding year.  10 of the men and 5 of the women on staff in April 2017 had joined the company since the beginning of the year.  Gender pay gap reporting is not required under the 2017 Act for Starfrost (UK) Ltd and Star M&E Solutions Limited because they have less than 250 employees.
