To foster greater diversity, we need an inclusive, open and supportive working environment where everyone is valued, respected and able to meet their full potential. This is at the heart of Miller and reinforced by our values: we do the right thing, deliver on our promises and work as one team.       “We want Miller to be a place where people feel confident to be themselves and for our employees and partners to be representative of the diversity of London, our clients and the international markets in which we operate.”  Greg Collins, CEO       Inclusion@Miller  In 2015, Miller signed up to the Inclusion@Lloyd’s charter, a public commitment to promote diversity and inclusion within the Lloyd’s market, and in 2016, formed its own Inclusion@Miller committee whose purpose is to formulate and execute our diversity and inclusion strategy, drive our identified core priorities and ensure an ongoing focus on fostering greater diversity and inclusion within Miller.  The committee is formed of representatives from across the breadth of our business and is sponsored by a member of the Group Executive Committee.
