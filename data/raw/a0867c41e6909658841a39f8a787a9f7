Your healthcare closer to home

Introduction 

Central London Community Healthcare NHS 
Trust’s (CLCH) vision is to provide great care 
closer to home.  This vision is brought to life  
by  the  commitment  and  dedication  from 
our  workforce  to  make  real  differences  to 
the  patients  we  care  for  across  10  London  
boroughs and Hertfordshire.  
 
The sharing of our gender pay gap report is 
integral to having meaningful conversations 
about equality and how this contributes to 
the vision and values of CLCH.  
 
It is encouraging to see that our gender pay 
gap (8.99%) is smaller than the UK average 
(18%)  but  this  means  that  the  overall 
average hourly rate is £1.84 per hour more 
for  men  than  women.  More  importantly, 
the  median  pay  gap  tells  us  that  the 
difference in the middle pay between men 
and women within CLCH is 1%, or £0.18p. 
 
The numbers in the statutory return only 
tell  part  of  the  story.  The  gender  pay  gap 
does  not  take  into  consideration,  amongst 

other things, the age of our staff, length of 
service, occupation and work pattern.  This 
report  goes  further  than  the  statutory 
disclosure  to  understand    possible  reasons 
for  a  difference  in  pay  between  men  and 
women  and  more 
importantly  what 
possible actions can be taken. 
 
Gender pay gap v Equal pay 
 
The  gender pay gap  does  not  demonstrate 
any  equal  pay  concerns. 
is  a 
fundamental difference between equal pay 
and the gender pay gap.  Equal pay is where 
men and women are paid the same for like 
work.  The gender pay gap is the difference 
between the gross hourly earnings for both 
men  and  women  across  an  organisation. 
The  Trust  pays  most  of  its  staff  via  the 
Agenda for Change pay bands, which means 
that  gender  is  not  a  factor  in  the  amount 
we pay staff. 
 
It  is  recognised  that  proportionately,  CLCH 
have more men in the higher quartile which 
results in a mean pay gap in favour of men. 

  There 

It is  also  acknowledged  that  there  is  a  gap 
between  part  time  men  and  women  of 
£3.88  per  hour.    This  can  be  attributed  to 
the  number  of  women  working  part  time 
for  CLCH  (1078)  compared  to  men  (76) 
working in different roles within the Trust. 
 
However,  women  do  compare  favourably 
across  a  range  of  pay  bands  within  CLCH.  
This data can provide a platform for CLCH to  
review,  analyse  and  make  plans 
for 
reducing the gender pay gap. 
 
The  value  of  the  statutory  disclosure 
therefore  is  the  questions  it  raises  and 
fundamentally,  the  action  we  take.    These 
statistics  provide  CLCH  with  a  means  to 
check  and  challenge  through  analysis  and 
seek  to  implement  strategies  to  further 
minimise the gender pay gap. 
 
 
 

Data analysis 
The  data  used  in  this  report  for  gender  pay  gap  reporting,  has  been 
generated from the NHS workforce profile dashboard in Electronic Staff 
Record  (ESR)  and  relates  to  the  snapshot  date  31st  March,  2017.  This 
data is contained in the Business Intelligence (BI) function.1 
 
The  technical  guidance  of  the  report  can  be  located  from  IBM  under 
guidance note ESR-NHS0265.  
 
The  guideline  is  explained  in  ESR’s  programme  newsletter  (December 
2017). 
 
The NHS pay structure 
 
As a NHS Trust, CLCH is governed by the NHS pay structures, comprising 
of:  
 
Agenda for Change  
•
• Medical and Dental  
•
 
 

Very Senior Managers (VSM) pay framework. 

 

Both  agenda  for  change  and  medical  and  dental  have  bands or  grades 
within their own pay structure. There are a number of incremental spine 
points  in  each  band  or  grade  where  staff  can  be  awarded  increments 
annually or pass through thresholds based on job plan reviews (primarily 
for medical and dental staff). 
 
The  majority  of  staff  in  CLCH  are  employed  on  agenda  for  change  pay 
bands which was developed in partnership with Trade Unions and based 
on the principle of equal pay for equal value.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Gender Pay Gap Report:  Statutory disclosure and further analysis 
 
This  report  details  the  statutory    gender  pay  gap  disclosure  as  well  as 
looking  at  the  breakdown  of  overall  pay  between  men  and  women 
working  for  CLCH  and  the  hourly  pay  for  full  and  part  time  men  and  
women.   
 
The  report  goes on to  look  at the  numbers of men and  women within 
pay bands, which goes further than the statutory pay quartiles required 
by the regulations.   
 
Given  the  geographical  spread  of  CLCH,  consideration  is  given  on 
whether  the  pay  differentials  in  High  Cost  Area  Supplement  (HCAS) 
impacts on gender pay, however the data contained in this report proves 
inconclusive that HCAS adversely impacts on gender pay. 
 
Given the data analysis, the report concludes with CLCH’s plan to work 
towards reducing the gender pay gap.

Possible reasons for the gender pay gap 
High Cost Area Supplement 
 
CLCH  operates  across  a  number  of  London  boroughs  and 
throughout Hertfordshire, all of which attract a different level 
of high cost area supplement (HCAS) for inner London, outer 
London and fringe).   
 
Annex 9 of the NHS terms and conditions of service handbook 
(agenda  for  change)  detail  the  level  of  supplement  given  to 
employees, dependent on where they work geographically. 

 

The  question  therefore  is  whether  the  difference  in  pay 
between  inner,  outer  and  fringe  impacts  on  the  mean  and 
median gender pay gap for CLCH. 

 

At the snapshot date, the pay differential between inner and 
outer HCAS was £640 (£4,158-£3,518) at the minimum level of 
HCAS and £1,922 (£6,405-£4,483) at the top level of HCAS.  
 
The figures in the tables on the next page, demonstrate little 
differences in the average hourly pay and that would suggest 
HCAS does not have a detrimental impact on the gender pay 
gap. 
 
The largest difference between full time, including HCAS and 
excluding HCAS is £0.13p per hour at band 5, both of which, 
favour men.  

 

The largest difference between part time, including HCAS and 
excluding  HCAS  is  £0.36p  per  hour  at  Band  8d/9  and  VSM, 
both of which, favour women. 
 

 
The  main  differences  in  gender  pay  can  be  found  in  the 
medical and dental professions with a pay gap of over £15 per 
hour for full time staff.  The gap is demonstrated through pay 
differentials  within  the  grades  for  medical  and  dental  staff.  
The  analysis looks at the entire professional group, rather that 
the types of role or grade of doctors.  For example a part-time 
Speciality  Doctor  on  £37,923  per  annum  compared  to  a 
Consultant earning £103,490 per annum can see a difference 
in excess of £65,000 per annum.   
 
 
CLCH  will  continue  to  ensure  that  recruitment  practices  are 
open and transparent and will continue to review adverts and 
identify  possible  barriers  that  may  prevent  women  from 
applying for senior medical and dental posts within CLCH. 
 
 
Similarly,  senior  management  roles  (band  8d/9/VSM)  have  a 
pay gap in favour of men of over £5 per hour for full time staff 
yet part time women in senior roles receive on average £41.27 
per hour; £8.75 more than men.  This difference  is caused by 
the increment point and length of service in post. 
 
 
CLCH  will  review  recent  recruitment  activity  for  senior 
management roles with the aim of seeing if anything else can 
be  done  to  encourage  women  to  apply  for  the  most  senior 
management  roles,  whilst  reinforcing  that  men  are  able  to 
take  advantage  of  CLCH’s  flexible  working  policies  and 
practices.   
 

 
During the snapshot date, the Executive Leadership Team comprised of three men (Chief Executive, Deputy Chief 
Executive  and  Director  of  Finance)  and  two  women  (Chief  Nurse  and  Medical  Director).  In  the  senior 
management roles (band 8d/9 and VSM pay), 15 were men and 16 were women. 
 
Actions to be taken 
 
CLCH  is  committed  to  ensuring  an  equitable  workforce  and  we  will  continue  to  work  towards  achieving  the 
following actions  
 
1. As  identified,  we  will  continue  to  review  any  barriers  that  may  prevent  women  from  applying  and  being 

selected for senior medical and dental roles as well as senior management roles. 

2. CLCH are committed to addressing the gap by undertaking actions within the Quality strategy and the People 
strategy.  This will ensure that, not only do we attract women into the most senior management posts, we 
also  encourage  men  to  apply  for  roles  predominantly  filled  by  women    and  create  a  more  even  gender 
balance . 

3. CLCH actively support women who return to work after their maternity or adoption leave and will continue to 
communicate  and  promote  caring  initiatives  for  both  men  and  women  such  as  shared  parental  leave  and 
other flexible working opportunities.
