2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

Acorn Mobility Services Ltd, formed in 1992, is an independent manufacturer and supplier of 
stairlifts. Acorn is required to publish an annual gender pay gap report under the Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.

Context of Gender Pay Gap Reporting

It is worth noting that Gender Pay Gap statistics e(cid:31) ectively compare average pay and bonus 
received by all men in the workplace compared with average pay and bonus received by all 
women in the workplace.  What it doesn’t do is tell us anything about whether men and women 
are paid equally for the same or similar roles within the business.

Acorn has a clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless 
of their sex (or any other characteristic). As such, we:

•  carry out pay and beneﬁ ts audits at regular intervals
•  evaluate job roles and pay rates as necessary to ensure a fair structure
•  have put in place banded pay structures for roles within the business to ensure consistency

We are therefore conﬁ dent that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women 
di(cid:31) erently for the same or equivalent work. Rather our gender pay gap is the result of the roles in 
which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.

At 13.3%, Acorn’s mean gender pay gap is signiﬁ cantly lower than both that for the whole 
economy  of 17.4% and that for our sector of 16.5% (according to the October 2017 O(cid:29)  ce for 
National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) ﬁ gures). 

At 7.4%, Acorn’s median gender pay gap is also signiﬁ cantly lower than both that for the whole 
economy  of 18.4% and that for our sector of 20.8% (according to the October 2017 ONS ASHE 
ﬁ gures). 

Understanding the Gap

We are conﬁ dent that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women di(cid:31) erently 
for the same or equivalent work. Rather our gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men 
and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.

We have more than 120 skilled Service and Installation Engineers, whom are almost exclusively 
male. Their pay reﬂ ects the technical nature of their roles and results in them making up 47% of 
the upper quartile in our pay data.

If we exclude these roles from our upper quartile pay data, the proportion of males to females 
becomes 51% male and 49% female.

2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

The mean gender bonus gap for Acorn is relatively large at 51.6% .  However, our analysis reveals 
that this is due to the typical gender make up of roles which attract bonuses within the business.   
Included in these ﬁ gures are our Installation Engineers, who are almost exclusively male, and 
whose pay is mostly made up of piece rate bonuses. If these Engineers are excluded from the 
ﬁ gures the pay gap is -29%.  Further, if you consider these as amounts rather than in percentage 
terms, the ﬁ gures involved are comparatively small, with a di(cid:31) erence of only £1,176 between the 
average female and male bonus paid for the full 12 month period. 

Unfortunately, fewer women study and work in engineering disciplines in the UK (Source: 
WISE campaign for gender balance in science technology & engineering, Women in STEM 
workforce 2017, published Oct 2017).  Across the UK economy as a whole, men are therefore 
more likely than women to be in ﬁ eld based engineering roles, which attract higher rates of pay 
than other roles.  

Our ﬁ eld based engineering roles are also physically demanding and require an element of heavy 
lifting, due to the nature of our product.  This results in the roles being less attractive to female 
workers, is reﬂ ected in the very low number of female job applicants we received for these role 
and remains a challenge for Acorn in recruiting female engineers.

What are we doing?

Acorn’s gender pay gap compares favourably with that of organisations both across the whole 
UK economy and within the manufacturing sector and we are conﬁ dent that our approach to 
pay promotes fairness and equality for men and women in the same or similar roles.   We also 
recognise that our scope to reduce this gap by attracting more females into our ﬁ eld based 
engineering roles is limited - we have, for example, no direct control over career choices 
individuals make.

Our plan: 

•  To continue carrying out regular pay and beneﬁ ts audits and job evaluation to ensure fairness 

and consistency in our pay structures

•  To work on a project with other local employers and schools/colleges to promote 

manufacturing and engineering to young people in our region through an Industrial Centre 

  of Excellence. 
•  To engage with EEF The Manufacturer’s Organisation, who are working to encourage more 

women into careers in manufacturing and engineering.

I / we conﬁ rm that the information in this statement is accurate.
