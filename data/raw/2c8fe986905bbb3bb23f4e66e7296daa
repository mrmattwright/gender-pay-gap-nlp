The data published is based on a snapshot in April 2017.     In this document we outline the ways in which the different measures are calculated, and our results. The calculations have been made according to a strict formula, with all the results published on the Governmentâ€™s Gender Pay Gap Service website . This shows that on some of the measures the pay gap in Centra compares well with other employers, especially on hourly pay rates.
