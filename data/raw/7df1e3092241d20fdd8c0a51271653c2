The calculation therefore takes into account all jobs at all levels and salaries. In terms of the mean and median statistics across our business, there are differences, and this is down to the fact that there are more males employed in our manufacturing business than there are women.  Our illustrative charts below outline these differences, and the key numbers are as follows:  0% Pay difference between men and women in the same roles  0% Pay difference in bonuses paid to men and women in the same roles  3.7% Median difference in hourly pay across the business
(female to male employment ratio 1:2.85)  16.9% Mean difference in hourly pay across the business
(female to male employment ratio 1:2.85)      The data above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.
