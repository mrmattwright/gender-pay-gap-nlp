It is influenced by a range of factors, including demographics of the company’s workforce. It is important to note the Gender Pay Gap is different from Equal Pay. We are required to publish the gap in pay between men and women on both a median basis and a mean basis. 
The mean gender pay gap is the difference in the average pay for women compared to men, within a company.
The median represents the middle point of a population. If you lined up all the women and all the men in a company separately, the median pay gap is the difference between the hourly pay rate for the middle women compared to that of the middle man.  
In addition, we are required to disclose the distribution of gender by pay quartile – this means splitting the workforce into four groups based on their pay and showing the proportion of men and women in each group. 
Finally, we are required to disclose percentages of staff receiving bonuses by gender and the gender gap on bonuses. The snapshot date for this data is 5th April 2017. The national gender pay gap from the Office of National Statistics (2016) is 18.1%.  Download our Gender Pay Gap statement.
