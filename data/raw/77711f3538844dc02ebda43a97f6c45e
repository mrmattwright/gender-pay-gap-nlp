Fortel is confident that it pays broadly equally for work of equal value.  Fortel actively promotes a diverse workforce regardless of gender, race, age, sexual orientationor disability. The Company is an Equal Opportunities Employer, Disability Confident Employer and a Black and Minority Employer.  The company has reported a median gender pay gap of 19.9% and a mean gender pay gap of -8.8%. A median gender bonus gap of -1.7% and mean gender bonus gap of 78.6%.  Females and Males in each Quartile:    Top Quartile  :  Females = 0.4  Males = 99.6    Upper Middle Quartile  :  Females = 0.4  Males = 99.6    Lower Middle Quartile  :  Females = 3.8  Males = 96.2    Lower Quartile  :  Females = 4.2  Males = 95.8     The proportion of Males receiving a bonus was 10.7% and the proportion of Females receiving a bonus was 30.0%.  The gender pay gap results from the under-representation of women in its senior and overall workforce. Such characteristics are typical of the construction industry as a whole and are not unique to Fortel. Stereotypes around the Security and Construction sector are major challenges for all employers in the industry.  The Company has family friendly and flexible working policies in place and supports women returning to work after taking maternity leave, with part-time workingand or jobsharing opportunities being made available. We will continue to explore how to attract more women into the organisation by reviewing our recruitment and talent retention practicesin order to create a more even gender balance; especially in more senior roles. Fortel is also actively committed to recruiting more women via the apprenticeship programme.  We are committed to making sure all of our employees are rewarded equally and fairly, irrespective of gender.
