Eddie Stobart saw iForce as being strategically complementary to its existing services.          Eddie Stobart Logistics plc is pleased to announce a partnership between Eddie Stobart and Speedy Freight.   On 7 th July 2017, Eddie Stobart Logistics acquired a 50% interest in Puro Ventures Limited, which trades as Speedy Freight, and will be jointly owned (50%) by the Eddie Stobart Logistics group.          Eddie Stobart Logistics plc is pleased to announce a partnership between Eddie Stobart and Speedy Freight   On 7 th July 2017, Eddie Stobart Logistics plc acquired a 50% interest in Puro Ventures Limited, which trades as Speedy Freight, and will be jointly owned (50%) by the Eddie Stobart Logistics group.   Speedy Freight is a franchised business offering a 24-hour, same-day expedited freight service to businesses, specialising in single load, point-to-point urgent deliveries. Speedy Freight has grown rapidly in recent years along with dedicated delivery services to business customers in the retail, e-commerce and industrial sectors, many of whom are shared with Eddie Stobart.   The business has generated significant growth through its franchising model, which offers an accessible route to the growing demands of the fast delivery market. The management team has created a strong brand name that customers recognise and trust and in the past 6 months alone, the business has seen 51% growth. These services are complementary to both the existing Eddie Stobart business, which operates a well-established end-to-end supply chain network throughout the UK, and the recently acquired iForce e-commerce business.  Alex Laffey, CEO of Eddie Stobart Logistics plc, said: “We are delighted to announce this partnership. We see great potential to go even further for our business customers through this collaboration, offering them access to services we know they are in need of and currently source elsewhere. We already share a number of customers in the retail, e-commerce and industrial sectors, servicing their logistics requirements through warehousing and high volume full- and less-than-truckload transportation and this partnership will extend that to single pallet movements.”  Mike Smith, MD of Speedy Freight said: “Speedy Freight has enjoyed a period of good growth and expansion and this partnership with Eddie Stobart comes at a great time in our development, bringing new opportunities to us corporately, to our growing network of franchisees, and, most importantly, to our business customers.”  Visit Speedy Freight website    Eddie Stobart Logistics plc is pleased to announce its acquisition of iForce   On 27 th April 2017 Eddie Stobart acquired e-fulfilment company iForce.   Eddie Stobart purchased iForce as it viewed the company as being strategically complementary to its existing services – in particular, in providing ESL with access to industry-leading software and operational capabilities in retail e-commerce, a sector that continues to enjoy market-leading growth. Eddie Stobart was also impressed by the growth in scale of iForce over the preceding three years. iForce continues to operate as a separate division of Eddie Stobart under the control of its existing management.  iForce is now part of Eddie Stobart – one of the largest logistics companies in the UK – and the two companies have a combined turnover of well over £600m per annum.
