This is irrespective of their age, gender, race, sexual orientation, marital or civil partnership status, religion or beliefs.  We have a legal and moral responsibility for ensuring that discrimination does not occur at the Hospice and that there is an effective policy in place which we monitor and review regularly.  Gender Pay Gap Reporting  From 2017 onwards, any UK organisation employing over 250 people has to publicly report on its pay gender gap. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and women in an organisation.
