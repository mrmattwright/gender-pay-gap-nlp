This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employees data.    We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. We will do this within one calendar year of April 5 th 2017.    We can use these results to assess:    the levels of gender equality in our workplace    the balance of male and female employees at different levels    how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.      The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.    F urther details about gender pay gap reporting can be found by:    talking to your Headteacher or Line Manager    contacting the HR department    looking at our company handbook (from September 2018) or website      Gender Pay Reporting requires our organisation to make calculations based on employee gender. We will establish this by using our existing HR and payroll records. All employess can can confirm and update their records if they choose to by contacting the HR Department.
