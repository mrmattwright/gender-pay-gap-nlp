Gender Pay 
Gap Report
2017

Foreword

2017 has been an exciting year for McCain as we announced a new global CEO as well 
as significant investment into our operations in Great Britain. This investment presents 
opportunities that span our entire supply chain and importantly our employees. 

At McCain we know that our business is enhanced when our workforce represents the 
diversity  of  our  customers,  consumers,  suppliers  and  communities.  We  therefore 
welcome  the  introduction  of  ‘Gender  Pay’  reporting  and  acknowledge  the  need  for 
progress in bridging the gap that exists today.

For McCain, our first report shows that whilst our gender pay gap is better than the 
national average, we still have improvements to make.

We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce and a number of actions 
have been and will continue to be taken to promote gender equality in our business.  
These initiatives include gender based training programmes, enhanced flexible working 
policies  and  using  talent  management  programmes  to  develop  and  engage 
high–potential females for senior roles. 

This  is  the  start  of  our  journey  and  our  leadership  team  at  McCain  is  committed  to 
further  developing  an  environment  where  all  employees  can  flourish,  regardless  of 
gender.

Calculating the 
Gender Pay Gap

The UK Government’s new Gender Pay Gap legislation requires that all companies in Great 
Britain with more than 250 employees publish their gender pay gap on an annual basis. 

McCain Foods (GB) Ltd employs over 1,600 people across Great Britain, and in this report we 
share a range of statistics that help to explain our gender pay gap. This report details our April 
2017 results.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GENDER PAY GAP AND EQUAL PAY

Equal Pay is the legal right for men and women to receive the same payment for doing the 
same or similar jobs, and we have a grading system in place to ensure this. Whereas the 
gender pay gap is the difference in average pay between men and women within an 
organisation. The key statistics used for this are:  

Mean gender pay gap
The mean gender pay gap is the 
difference in average hourly pay for 
women compared to men. 

Median gender pay gap
To find the median gender pay gap, the 
hourly pay of all men and women within 
an organisation is ordered from smallest 
to largest in two separate lists. The 
hourly pay of the middle woman is then 
compared to that of the middle man.

Understanding 

our gender pay gap 

At  McCain  Foods  (GB)  Ltd,  the 
mean  gender  pay  gap  is  9.2%, 
compared to the national average, 
which was released by the Office 
for  National  Statistics,  of  18.1%. 
A key factor in our business which 
influences  both  the  mean  and 
median  gender  pay  gap  is  that 
men  currently  occupy  a  higher 
proportion of senior roles.

It is this factor that also influences 
our gender bonus pay gap. While 
a  higher  proportion  of  women 
receive bonus payments, it is the 
senior  roles  that  tend  to  attract 
larger bonuses, and therefore we 
see  a  gap  in  mean  and  median 
gender  bonus  payments.  The 
bonus pay gap is also impacted by 
the  higher  proportion  of  female 
employees that work part-time.
