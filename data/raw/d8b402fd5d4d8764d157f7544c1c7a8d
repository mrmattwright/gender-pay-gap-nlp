Gender Pay Gap  
Report 2017

Introduction

At Longhurst Group we pride ourselves on being fair 
and having a culture of inclusiveness, along with a 
strong set of values which reflect and meet the needs 
of our customers within the communities we work. 

Reducing gender inequality is really important to us 
and within this report, we have been completely open 
about how far we have come and where we know we 
still have work to do.

Our Group is made up of four member companies 

– Axiom, Friendship Care and Housing, Longhurst 
and Havelok Homes and Spire Homes. Although we 
do not have to report on any part of the Group which 
has fewer than 250 colleagues, we want to be open 
and transparent, so we have reported the gender pay 
gap for the whole of Longhurst Group. People are 
employed within different parts of the Group, so it is 
better to look at our results as a whole.

We have a mean gender pay gap of 20.5% and a 

median gender pay gap of 16.8%. This is lower than the 
UK National Median Gender Pay Gap of 18.1%, but we 
are far from complacent and are committed to working 
hard to close this gap.

Longhurst Group is a 
great place to work and 
it is our differences that 
make the difference at 
Longhurst Group.

Longhurst Group | Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 What is the gender pay gap?

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay 
between all men and women. Legally we are required to 
publish both median and mean gender pay gap information.

How the gender pay gap is calculated

What is the mean?
The mean is our average pay. This 
is calculated by adding up all of 
our salaries and dividing it by the 
number of colleagues.

What is the median?               
If all colleagues were lined up 
in rows of men and women, in 
order of pay from highest to 
lowest, the median gender pay 
gap compares the pay of the 
woman in the middle of their line 
and the pay of the middle man.

It’s important to know 
that the Gender Pay 
Gap is not the same 
as Equal Pay.

consolidated bonus, which was calculated as a percentage of their salary. 

Longhurst Group | Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 At Longhurst Group, we are a predominantly female organisation, and the majority of people who work in our care and support services are women.  Pay quartiles

We have worked hard to understand the story behind our 
numbers and can see that there are many factors making the 
difference.

The first factor is that at Longhurst Group, 76% of our 

workforce are made up of women, with many holding senior 
positions. This suggests there is no barrier to women progressing 
within their career in the organisation.

Julie Doyle, Chief Executive and four out of seven of the 

Executive Team are women. Seventy per cent of our Directors’ 
Team is also women. This explains the high number of women in 
the upper quartile and upper middle quartile.

The second part to our story is that we have more women 
working in social care positions, which is the norm across the 
sector. Our data shows that 82% of colleagues in the lower pay 
quartile are women.

Men employed within the Group predominantly sit within the 

top two pay quartiles as they hold senior leadership positions. 
These roles attract higher levels of pay, which explains why 
bonus payments, which are linked to salaries, are higher.

We also know that 65% of our colleagues in part-time work 
are women. This could be because a higher number of women 
are working part-time to provide home care or child care. 

Although these issues in the gender balance of our workforce 

reflect the wider societal norms across the UK, we understand 
there is a lot more we can do.

Below is a summary of where men and women 
sit in terms of the quartile pay bands. We listed 
the salary of every colleague in order and split the 
list into four equal parts.

Longhurst Group | Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 Addressing the Gender Pay Gap

Longhurst Group is an evolving organisation and the 
last 12 months have been an exciting year, which has 
seen continued growth with Axiom Housing Association 
joining our Group, the introduction of our new values 
and the embedding of our internal ‘One Team, One 
Vision’ approach.

What makes Longhurst Group a success though, is its 

people – both men and women – who all make such a 
fantastic contribution and I have never felt prouder.

Ensuring we develop people within their career and 

help them progress is what we’re all about. We don’t 
believe in girls’ jobs and jobs for the boys, we believe in 
opportunities for everyone, no matter what.

Ensuring we develop 
people within their career 
is what we’re all about. We 
don’t believe in girls’ jobs 
and jobs for the boys, we 
believe in opportunities for 
everyone, no matter what.

As you can see, women are widely represented at 

Longhurst Group, with many in senior positions and it’s 
great to see women getting on. However, we know that 
women, especially in our care and support services, also 
occupy many of our lower paid roles. This is because 
many of these roles in the past have been traditionally 
seen by society as more female-orientated. We will 
work hard to change this though, through proactive 
marketing campaigns to encourage more men into 
care, whilst making sure the true value of this work is 
really understood.

We are going to make sure we do everything we can 
to close our gender pay gap over the next few years and 
will build an action plan to achieve this. Not because we 
have to, but because we want to, as part of creating a 
great place to work and a fantastic culture.

Some of the areas we will be looking at will include 

our recruitment processes, making sure we continue to 
recruit without unconscious bias and ensure we have the 
right people in the right jobs, regardless of gender. We 
are also going to be reviewing our terms and conditions 
in the year ahead, which gives us a great opportunity to 
look at work life balance and gender pay issues.  

I am incredibly proud of this organisation and even 

prouder of the amazing and diverse workforce I get 
to lead. So yes, there is work to be done and I know it 
won’t happen overnight, but with a clear plan, I believe 
together we can crack it.
