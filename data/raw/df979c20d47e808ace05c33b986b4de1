Although we still support events, helping make London 2012 a success, we have grown into a much more diverse business.       In 2000 NCP acquired Project Centre Consultancy helping refocus the business, positioning us as a service provider. This same year we won our first on-street parking contract in Lewisham (a relationship we have maintained over the years and subsequent contracts). By 2004 we had created the Challenger bus and coach business (selling the business in 2009) and by 2006 we added Debt Recovery to our growing list of expertise. NCP demerged into two companies in 2007 with the newly created business officially becoming NSL in 2009.  Buying Patient First in 2010 marked our entrance into the health sector adding non-emergency patient transport to our capabilities. Our award winning Learning and Development Team helped us achieve Investors in People Gold in 2011 and all throughout 2012 we expanded rapidly winning new contracts in local and central government , health and airports . The latest expertise we have developed is Validation Solutions offering identity authentication services.  We now operate in local and central government, health, airports and the private sector offering business process management, enforcement, patient care, passenger transport, street and estate management and technical design consultancy.
