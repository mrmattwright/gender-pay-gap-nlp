This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women employed by our organisation. It will not involve publishing individual employee’s data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. The information below is based on data as at 5 April 2017.   Hourly Pay Gap     Mean gender gap  7.6%    Median gender gap  -6.9%     Bonus Pay Gap     Mean gender gap  96.3%    Median gender gap  91.4%     The proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment    Male  1.2%    Female  50%     The proportion of males and females in each quartile band     Male  Female    Lower  78.5%  21.5%    Lower Middle  95.4%  4.6%    Upper Middle  100%  0.0%    Upper  98.4%  1.6%    Supporting Statement  Payco Services Ltd is a commercial contracting company specialising in working with predominantly recruitment business clients and as a labour only supplier. We specialise in the engagement and supply of employees, self-employed subcontractors and limited businesses to meet the assignment requirements and demands of our clients and their clients in turn. This report includes all those legally classified as our employees.  Payco Services work in a host of different industry sectors including construction, engineering, waste management as well as many other technical sectors where the demand for the services provided by temporary recruitment businesses exists. Many of these sectors are heavily male dominated and this is borne out across the figures provided.  In the majority of circumstances it is our employees who source assignments and negotiate the fees payable to our business by the Recruitment Business and this will normally directly correlate to their rates of pay. This means that whilst the pay and conditions of our employees will always accurately reflect their skill, experience and industry sector the sheer multitude of individual circumstances and sectors make any comparison difficult.  This statement confirms that the published information is accurate as at the time of publishing and is signed by Steve Thomas, Managing Director.
