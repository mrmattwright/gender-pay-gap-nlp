UK GENDER   
PAY GAP REPORT

At De Beers we are committed to building a stronger business by creating an inclusive 
culture where diversity of all forms is highly valued. 

Embracing and valuing diversity of thought, skills and experience will enable us  
to build an even stronger business, and ensure we attract and retain the best people. 
Our initial focus in this effort has been on gender diversity. Women make up 50 per 
cent of the global talent pool, but with only 24 per cent of our workforce being female 
we know we are missing out on the brilliant contribution of talented women in our 
organisation.

We know we must be better and bolder in the advancement of women in our  
business and, in light of this, we welcome the introduction of gender pay gap reporting 
in the UK and the transparency it demands, and we are committed to addressing any 
gap that exists.

UNDERSTANDING OUR RESULTS

The data shows how the gender pay gap varies across the different pay quartiles (importantly, 
not across bands) and between De Beers UK and Forevermark UK. It illustrates how the pay 
gap correlates closely with female representation rates (and in the case of Forevermark, male 
representation rates). 

For bonus data, the gaps are larger at the lower quartiles due to a significant number of employees 
in different bands, with different bonus target opportunities, being in the same quartile. 

For both De Beers UK and Forevermark UK, it is the upper quartile where the gaps in pay and 
bonus become significant. This is due to lower numbers of women at the highest levels of both 
organisations, including our ExCo who, as at April 2017, were all men. Since then, three women 
have been appointed to the De Beers Group ExCo.

The data reinforces and provides further evidence around the importance of our gender diversity 
and inclusion work, and our focus on increasing the number of women in senior leadership. 
Having a balanced representation throughout the organisation, including at the senior level, will 
address the gap of earnings between men and women. 

“Improving the prospects for women and girls advances an 
entire society and organisation, as everyone benefits from 
the increased diversity of experience, skills and insight that 
greater representation of women delivers. We are in the early 
stages of our journey toward gender parity and we know that 
achieving our goals will require a dedicated and ongoing 
focus that continues well beyond our initial 2020 target.”

GENDER DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AT DE BEERS

De Beers has made a strong commitment to gender equality and standing with women and girls, 
and in September 2017 launched a three-year global partnership with UN Women, which includes 
the following three commitments:

Achieving parity* in the appointment of women  
and men into senior leadership positions by 2020 
•  Over the last 12 months our progress includes the launch of a Gender Diversity 

Steering Group, a review of talent attraction and development processes, the rollout 
of unconscious bias training, the establishment of a senior management-led reciprocal 
mentoring programme and 
the review of best-practice 
policies and recruitment 
guidelines. We have also 
appointed three women 
to the De Beers executive 
committee.

*   UN Women use the  

IMF definition of parity  
as 40-60 per cent

Investing US$3 million to advancing women and girls in our producing countries
• 

In southern Africa, we will be running programmes 
focused on accelerating the growth of women-owned 
micro-enterprises to enhance the capacity of women 
entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, increase their 
income and create sustainable jobs for themselves and 
their communities. 
In Canada, we are working with the University of 
Waterloo to provide scholarships and mentoring 
to young women and girls from underprivileged 
communities who want to pursue studies in Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).
