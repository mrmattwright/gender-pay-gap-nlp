THE RANGERS FOOTBALL CLUB 

GENDER PAY REPORT 2017

A NOTE FROM 
THE CLUB 

The Rangers Football Club sees the sharing of our Gender Pay Gap Report as an important 
step in moving forward with our wider focus on diversity and inclusion. We believe that 
significant steps have been made to encourage women to engage with and work in the football 
industry, whilst recognising that there is still room to improve the gender balance within our Club.   

GENDER PAY REPORTING 
– THE BACKGROUND

The UK Government has introduced new reporting regulations under the Equality Act 2010.  
The requirement is for companies with over 250 employees to disclose their gender pay 
annually from April 2018, using a snapshot date of 5 April the previous year.

WHAT IS THE 
GENDER PAY GAP?

A gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in the average pay of men and women. The nature 
of the work carried out is not considered in the calculations. As such, it is different from an equal pay 
comparison, which would involve comparison of people carrying out the same, similar or equivalent work.

HOW ARE THE MEAN AND 
MEDIAN GAPS CALCULATED?

The calculations have been carried out as per the ‘The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017’.
The mean gender pay gap shows the difference in the average hourly rate of pay between men 
and women. This is also affected by the different numbers of men and women in different roles.
The difference in the median hourly rate of pay is calculated by considering the middle of the 
range of both male and female rates of pay and calculating the difference between the two.
You can find more information about how the calculations were carried out here:

BEHIND THE DATA

The Football industry has traditionally been very male dominated, with females historically being underrepresented across the sector. The Rangers Football 
Club recognises that there are areas where improvements can be made. The industry standard salaries and bonuses awarded to players and football 
management impacts on the first set of figures above (shown in red on the bar chart on page 2). In order to provide clarity on the figures across the remainder 
of the business, a second set of figures has been shown in blue. These figures do not include playing staff or football management and when considering the 
Club’s median pay gap figure (20%) we are only slightly higher than the Scottish overall pay gap of 16% (source: ASHE median hourly earnings).  
In respect of the bonus pay gap figures, again our industry and the manner in which player contracts are designed impacts on the bonus pay gap figures 
above. In 2017 bonus eligibility extended only to the players, football management and executive management (representing only 6.33% of employees). As 
females are not currently represented in these areas, this explains the figures above and presents an opportunity for the Club to put measures in place to 
redress the balance.

There are more women than men in our lower paid roles, but fewer in our higher paid roles. This is again 
largely due to our industry and first team playing, management and support staff being predominantly male.

CLOSING THE GAP - OUR 
GENDER PAY COMMITMENT

We will not be able to remove the gender pay gap completely due to the nature of our industry; 
however the ways we have committed to reduce the gap in the wider business are listed below.

RECRUITMENT PRACTICES  – we do recognise that there is further work to be done to recruit 
more women into senior positions, therefore we commit to conducting a review of our recruitment and 
selection practices, to ensure that our recruitment campaigns are attracting more women to join the Club.  

RETENTION AND PROGRESSION OF OUR FEMALE TALENT – we will review our procedures for 
returning to work following family friendly absence, better promote our family friendly policies, provide 
training for line managers and strengthen access to training and development programmes for all. 

PAY REVIEW – we will conduct a review of our pay and reward processes to 
ensure fairness and consistency in method and application.

TRAINING – we will look to provide diversity & inclusion and 
unconscious gender bias training to our line managers.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION WORKING GROUP – our consultative forum (Rangers Charity Foundation and 
The Rangers Football Club together with external voices) will continue to actively develop our work in this area.  

STEWART ROBERTSON
MANAGING DIRECTOR

I confirm this data is a true reflection of our gender pay, at the 
snapshot period of 5th April 2017 and has been calculated in 
accordance with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
