UK Gender Pay Gap   

Report 2017  

Gender Pay Gap in Hourly rate 

As part of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, Fishers are required to report on specific 
figures on the Gender Pay Gap as the organisation has more than 250 employees. The gender pay gap is calculated as being 
the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings. Figures are calculated 
using a specific reference date each year, known as the Snap-shot date. The data for calculating the hourly rate pay gap and 
quartile analysis in this report is taken from the pay period snap-shot date of 5 April 2017.

The charts above show the distribution of gender over the four quartiles on the company, split by pay grade. 
 
The lower proportion of females in the upper quartile is predominantly due to a dominance of male employees in 
Engineering and HGV Driver roles.

employees in sales positions reflect the figures above.

In order to show where the variations in Fishers Gender 
Pay  gap  arise  we  have  provided  a  breakdown  of  the 
distribution of males and females in each department.  
 
As  shown,  all  of  our  employees  in  engineering  and 
transport  are  male.  The  number  of  women  in  these 
professions are significantly less than the number of men 
therefore  we  are  restricted  when  recruiting  new 
employees.  
 
At  Fisher’s  we  are  committed  to  supporting  and 
developing  a  diverse  workforce  in  order  to  continue  to 
grow our business.
