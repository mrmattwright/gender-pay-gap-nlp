success - today and in the future - because a diverse workforce is
an important force for innovation. The BMW Group is convinced that
diversity is crucial to our ability to perform effectively and will
ensure the long-term success of our Company.    The full Board of Management of
the BMW Group established a commitment to diversity as part of the
Company's human resources and sustainability strategy back in 2010.
In 2011, the BMW Group signed up to the Diversity Charter in
Germany and committed itself to create a working environment free
of prejudices.   At Plant Swindon, we are working hard
on a corporate culture that promotes tolerance, mutual respect and
equality of opportunity.     We support the UK Government's drive
for companies to be more transparent on gender pay issues and
confirm that the data reported is accurate and in line with The
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations
2017.     To read the report please click
