their  data  on 

1.  Introduction 
 
In  April  2017  the  government  made  a 
commitment  to  increasing  transparency  in 
how  dispersed  pay  and  remuneration 
is 
between men and women. 
 
The gender pay gap report is an integral part 
of  the  Equality  Act  (2010)  and  a  statutory 
requirement. All organisations whether in the 
private, public or third sector are required to 
publish,  annually, 
the 
divergence  of  pay  and 
remuneration 
between men and women. 
 
In  this  report  we  share  the  data  required  as 
part  of  the  legislation,  but  also  aim  to  go 
further to detail what the statistics mean for 
our organisation. 
 
The data presented is accurate as at 31 March 
2017,  which  is  the  statutory  data  capture 
point. 
 
2. Gender pay and equal pay 
 
The gender pay gap analysis is not the same 
as equal pay.  
 
Equal  pay  deals  with  the  pay  differences 
between men and women who carry out the 
same job, similar jobs or work of equal value. 
It 
is  unlawful  to  pay  people  unequally 
because they are a man or a woman. 
 
The gender pay gap shows the difference  in 
the average pay between all men and women 
in  a  workforce. 
If  a  workforce  has  a 
particularly  high  gender  pay  gap,  this  can 
indicate  there may  be  a  number of issues to 
deal with, and the individual calculations may 
help to identify what those issues are. 
 
 
 
3. Our workforce composition 
 
At  the  Tavistock  and  Portman  we  employ  a 
workforce which is not dissimilar to other NHS 
organisations  with  just  under  a  third  of  our 
staff being men. 
 

 

Provided  below  is  an  analysis  of  gender 
distribution across all of our pay grades. The 
data shows that women make up the majority 
in every pay scale.

4. Our organisation’s pay systems 
 
In our organisation we have five sets of terms 
and conditions. The first three are determined 
nationally by  the  Department of Health and 
Social  Care  (DHSC)  and  negotiated  on  the 
government’s  behalf  by  NHS  Employers. 
These terms and conditions are the: 
 
  NHS  terms  and  conditions  of  service, 
formerly  known  as  Agenda  for  Change 
and apply to all the  vast  majority of our 
workforce.  Pay 
is 
determined  through  a  structured  and 
weighted job evaluation system; 
 
Junior doctor (2015) terms and conditions 
of service which apply to all doctors who 
work  at  the  Trust  after  leaving  medical 
school  to  the  point  of  them  obtaining 
their  certificate  upon  completion  of 
training  (CCT)  and  becoming  eligible  to 
apply  for  a  consultant  position.  Pay  for 
these  individuals  are  set  in  a  structured 
pay  scale  which  aligns  to  the  level  of 
training they have reached; and

  Consultant  contract  (2003)  terms  and

medically qualified consultants. 

 
The local pay schemes which we operate are 
the: 
 
  Very  senior  manager  (VSM)  terms  and 
conditions  which  are  determined  by  the 
Trust’s  executive  appointments  and 
remuneration committee and apply to all 
members  of  the  executive  management 
team; and 
 
Senior  manager  terms  and  conditions 
which  apply  to  staff  where  their  pay

arrangements  cannot  be  determined 
through  the  AfC  job  grading  process. 
These  salaries  are  reviewed  annually  by 
the 
chief 
executive  and  director  of  human 
resources  and  are 
set  by  using 
remuneration benchmarking.

5. The basic pay gap analysis 
 
The  basic  pay  gap  is  an  analysis  of  all 
employees  and  the  fixed  pay  elements  that 
they  receive  (e.g.  basic  pay,  high  cost  area 
supplement  and  others)  and 
then  an 
assessment of how pay differs by genders.

Our  statistics  show  that  we  have  a  pay  gap, 
but it is small. 
 
6. Bonus pay gap 
 
At  the  Tavistock  and  Portman  we  do  not 
operate  bonus  schemes  for  any  of  our  staff 
employed  on  agenda  for  change  or  very 
senior  manager  terms  and  conditions  of 
service.  
 
Part  of  the  consultant  contract  (2003)  terms 
and conditions of service, senior medical staff 
are  eligible 
for 
discretionary  pay  to  award  them  for  their 
merits in clinical care, education and research 
– these are known more commonly as clinical 
excellence awards (CEAs). These are classified, 
for the purposes of this report, as bonuses. 
 
There are two types of CEAs one which can be 
awarded  by  local  employers  through  an 
annual  application  and  assessment  regime. 
The second is a national scheme operated by 
the Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence 
Awards (ACCEA) which is a committee hosted 
by the Department of Health and Social Care 
(DHSC). 
 
At  the  time  that  the  data  was  captured  to 
inform  this  report  we  employed  33  medical 
grade consultants.

Median 
 
The national data has identified that we have 
a  large  difference  in  the  number  of  male 
consultants 
payments 
compared to women.  
 
One of the known issues with the CEA process 
is  that  the  national  framework  tends  to 
favour those that work full time. Through our 
local  panel 
the 
assessors are mindful of the part time nature 
of our consultant workforce and that many of 
those  that  chose  to  work  less  than  full  time 
hours  are  normally  women.  Based  on  this, 
robust  discussions  have  taken  place  at 
previous  panels  about  to  acknowledge  this 
and give appropriate weighted credit, where 
it is appropriate. 
 
7. Conclusions and next steps 
 
These workforce statistics have highlighted a 
number  of  areas  where  we  need  to  give 
attention to. 
 
Over the coming months we will be exploring 
the  data  in  a  much  more  granular  way  to 
understand  where  our  pay  disparities  are
