Argus aims to be a good citizen, contributing back to the areas in which it operates.  Giving  Argus donates money to many international charities each year. Staff are asked to nominate specific organisations and the Argus Board of Directors decides which ones to support.  Charities that Argus supports in 2017/18 include:     Age UK  ALS Association  Autistica  Breast Cancer Haven  British Red Cross   CARE  Care International  Children in Crisis  CLEFT  Committee for the Protection of Journalists  Doctors of the World  Friends of Singlegate Primary School Parent-Teacher Association (FOSS-PTA)  Goonj  Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity  Hackney Winter Night Shelter  International Rett Syndrome Foundation (IRSF)  Islington Boat Club  Mary's Meals  Médecins Sans Frontières UK (MSF UK)  Orchid  Pete's Dragons  PSP Association  Robin Hood  Ronald McDonald House Charities  Save the Children  StreetInvest  The Samaritans  Workshop Houston    Worldreader   In addition, Argus supports staff who raise money for charities, for example by matching donations for sponsored events. Argus also participates in externally organised fund-raising activities including events run by the Carl McCain Memorial Foundation, Doctors of the World, the Histiocytosis Foundation and many others.  Environment  All of the Argus offices operate recycling policies. We recycle paper, food waste that goes into electricity and heat generation and fertilizer, IT equipment, toner cartridges and batteries among other things.  Staff  Argus is an equal opportunities employer and our staff includes people of many nationalities and cultural backgrounds, different ages and genders, and physical abilities.  Argus’ gender pay report for 2017 can be viewed here.  Argus also takes steps to ensure that third parties we work with have proper employment rights and benefits. For example, in its UK offices, Argus requires that contractors pay the London living wage as a minimum to their staff.
