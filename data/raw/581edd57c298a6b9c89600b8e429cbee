UK Gender Pay Gap Report 

2017-2018

Foreword

Equality and inclusivity are at the heart of what we do both in fulfilling 
our mission and how we act as an employer. We strive to provide an 
equal platform for all in order to fulfill their potential and our values 
embody this:

•      We act collaboratively and with mutual support.
•      We work with integrity and respect.
•      We believe in trust, empowerment and accountability in all that we do.
 
The outcome of our Gender Pay Gap reporting has confirmed to us that we 
have work to do to ensure that we live up to our values. We are committed 
to taking actions that will close this gap.

We have already taken some actions to start to address it. We are 
now undertaking additional analysis and consultation to understand 
fully what lies behind the numbers and to respond effectively across 
the organisation. 

Simon Hunt
Managing Director
Oxford Policy Management

At Oxford Policy Management, 
our mission is to help low- and 
middle-income countries 
achieve growth and reduce 
poverty and disadvantage 
through public policy reform.

I know from experience that a diverse organisation is more inspiring and 
productive to work in and achieves greater results.

At Oxford Policy Management, both the Board and the Management Team 
recognise that we have more work to do, both on the Gender Pay Gap and 
the promotion of wider diversity and inclusion.

As we focus on this, it will be important to increase our understanding of 
effective strategies and also to take more practical actions that will make 
a difference.

One of these actions will be to create a new Diversity Committee which 
will provide oversight to all of these actions and draw input and ideas 
from across our global operations. I am delighted to be the champion for 
this initiative.

Board Member

Measuring the gap

The Gender Pay Gap is a measure that shows the percentage difference 
between hourly earnings for men and women and is measured in relation 
to men’s pay - the higher the percentage, the bigger the gap. It does not 
measure Equal Pay, which relates to what women and men are paid for 
the same or similar jobs or work of equal value.

Under the UK Government’s Gender Pay Gap Regulations, any organisation 
with 250 or more employees must publish its Gender Pay Gap data 
annually, with the first report published no later than 4 April 2018. Current 
regulations only cover England, Scotland and Wales.

Calculating our numbers
The table below shows our mean and median hourly  
gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 and our bonus gap  
figures based on the 12 months prior to 5 April 2017.

Our figures only relate to those employees who have UK contracts of 
employment, in accordance with current legislation and do not include our 
employees who are employed locally in other countries.

Proportion of men and women in each quartile band. 
 
As required by the mandatory reporting, the chart below shows the gender 
distribution across OPM in four equal size quartiles (based on hourly pay rates).

 
 
Proportion of men and women receiving a bonus in 2017.

Understanding our pay gap
The main reason for our Gender Pay Gap is the way the roles taken by 
men and women are distributed across the organisation. 

From the published data, we can see that there are far more women than 
men in the two lower quartiles. At the upper middle quartile, the numbers 
are much nearer parity and at the upper quartile there are double the 
number of men to women.  

This distribution pattern affects the Gender Pay Gap as there is a much 
higher proportion of men than women in the higher-paid jobs within the 
organisation. Conversely, there are many more women than men in roles 
that have lower salaries.

At Oxford Policy Management, we believe in sharing our profits equally amongst 
our employees and therefore, our profit-sharing bonus scheme awards all 
employees the same amount, giving us a median bonus gender pay gap of zero. 

However, each year, a proportion of new starters do not receive a bonus in their 
first year due to their start date and this is reflected in our reported figures.

The mean bonus gender gap is the product of two specific bonus 
payments, one to the Managing Director as part of his remuneration 
package and one exceptional payment that will not be repeated.

Closing the gap

We are committed to closing our Gender Pay Gap and it is clear that to 
be successful, we have to address our gender balance at different levels 
within the organisation. We recognise that bringing about significant 
change will take time, however, if the right building blocks are in place, 
these will help us bring about the desired change.

We will be taking action to understand more fully the challenges of
working and progressing at OPM and listening to views and suggestions. 
We are committed to building an inclusive culture. 

Our recruitment and promotion processes are based on merit and we will 
review our processes to identify any improvements we can make to ensure 
that they remain unbiased and do not disadvantage anyone on account of 
their gender or any other aspect of their identity.

We are already taking actions that support our goal of closing the Gender 
Pay Gap and will continue this work, as outlined below.

Representation of women
We have taken positive action to ensure that there is balanced gender 
representation in key areas of OPM: 
• 

The Board: we have recruited more women on to the Board, the 
gender split (as at 1 April 2018) is now four men and five women.
Staff Consultative Committee: this group of elected employee 
representatives facilitate communication and consultation with the 
Management Team about issues of mutual concern. Initially the group 
was all male. It is now composed of four men and four women.
Leadership roles: a third of our Management Team roles are currently 
filled by women. Across the organisation, there are now more 
women in leadership roles than previously. In 2015, 30% of middle 
management roles were filled by women; by 2017, this figure had 
increased to 46%.

• 

• 

Introduction of more diverse recruitment panels
We have introduced an active policy of making our recruitment panels 
more diverse and in particular, ensuring that there is a good gender 
balance on each panel. 

Introduction of new processes for sizing jobs 
and managing salaries
Our company has grown very rapidly over the past few years and we 
have recently introduced new processes around job levelling and salary 
management, to provide us with more objectivity in our decision-making to 
ensure that we eliminate any unconscious gender bias.

Future actions

We recognise that the Gender Pay Gap has to be addressed and we need 
to better understand how to do this.

During the next few months, we will be creating opportunities for 
employees to provide us with the insights to enable us to develop a 
diversity and inclusion strategy which we will act upon.

An important first step will be to create a Diversity Committee, made up 
of individuals from across the organisation, to provide guidance for these 
activities and to ensure that our actions deliver the desired results. This 
will be supported by one of our Board members. 

In addition to our current activities, we will also be introducing diversity
training to help us to provide a fully inclusive culture.

Declaration

I confirm that the information and data reported is accurate as 
at 5 April 2017, according to the requirements of the Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
