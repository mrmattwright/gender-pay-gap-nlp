Gender Pay Gap Report

Mind the Gap 2018LUSHWhilst this report will be expressed in binary gender terms, we wish 
at the outset to acknowledge that Lush is made up of a vibrant and 
diverse group of people who don’t always fit neatly into conventional 
pigeon holes. 

Lush should be a safe place, and a level playing field, for everyone  
regardless of sex, gender, age, race, class, nationality, religion,  
disability, sexuality or any perceived difference. Our aim is always  
to celebrate diversity, to be gender neutral and for opportunity to  
be equally available to all.

This report undertakes to measure and reflect our company-wide pay  
in terms of male and female. Whilst we have come out better than the  
national average, there is still a pay gap between men and women in  
Lush, which we will explorein this report and infographics.

What we are reporting 
In order to make the gender pay gap 
more transparent, starting this year 
companies who employ more than 250 
people are required by law to measure 
and report their pay gap annually. The 
law requires male and female pay to be 
calculated separately to show any gap in 
Mean Pay, Median Pay, Bonus Pay and 
overall pay expressed as Quartiles.

Lush is made up of three separate 
companies - Lush Retail, Lush 
Manufacturing and Lush Ltd -  

and as each of these have more than 
250 employees, they are required to 
report separately. However, careers at 
Lush can have people move back and 
forth between these separate groups,  
so in this report we will also show the 
three companies figures added together 
into one overall Lush result.

Transparency about whether women are 
reaching the top of the Lush business is 
also important. For this reason we are 
also reporting our numbers of male and 
female directors.

What is Mean Pay?
To calculate Mean Pay you take the  
total £ amount of all salary and bonus  
earned and divide it by the number of staff 
paid. To see if there is a gender difference, 
you do one calculation of all the women in 
the business and a second calculation of 
all the men in the business. 

What is the Median?
If you made two lines of people,  
one containing every female in Lush  
and the other line every male, in order  
of lowest paid at one end to highest  
paid at the other - the person in the  
middle of the line is the Median.

Quartiles show the company payroll split into four quarters, lowest pay to highest pay -  
then show how many men and women are in each of those four pay bands.

What the Gender Pay Gap looks like across the UK nation as a whole.
Office for National Statistics figures show that in 2017, men on average were paid £1.32 
more per hour than women, which, as a proportion of men’s pay, is a pay gap of 18.4%.

Mind the Gap 2017LUSHEqual Pay and Gender Pay Gap are  
different things
Since the Equality Act 2010 women’s pay has been 
protected by law and employers cannot pay women 
less than men for doing work which is equal.
This is called Equal Pay.

However, in the workplace there is still a difference 
in overall wages of women versus men.  Women are 
not reaching the top ranks of businesses, are not 
sitting in the same numbers on company boards, 
are not entering some of the higher paid professions 
and are not even represented in Parliament in equal 
numbers.  This balance of more men at the top and 
more women at the bottom creates an environment 
where men earn more in their lifetime and have more 
career progression, whilst a higher percentage of 
women occupy part-time, low-paid and low-skilled 
roles.  This is called the Gender Pay Gap.  

So Equal Pay is about what an individual female 
employee gets paid for their work - but Gender 
Pay Gap is about adding together the wages of all 
the female employees in a company, then adding 
together the wages of all the male employees of the 
company and looking to see if the total male figure is 
bigger than the female total.   

Requiring companies to measure and report their 
Gender Pay Gap is an attempt to see if women in 
the UK are having equal opportunities to men across 
each business and across the nation as a whole.

The below scenario illustrates how there could be equal pay for men and women  

doing the same role, and yet still show a Gender Pay Gap.

creates the female pay gap will 
there ever be a chance to close 
it. Employers play a large part in 
eliminating the gap and giving 
women the same life choices 
available to men. 

At Lush we are committed to looking at how our pay 
and policies meet the needs of those working with us. 
For long term staff this means providing everyone with 
equal opportunities for progression and the scope 
for each individual’s skills and passions to contribute 
to the business, whilst also ensuring that roles can 
adapt to the changing needs of those individuals and 
their families. 

For transient staff who come to us part time to fit with 
other life commitments or during their student years, 
this means paying a Real Living Wage that helps part 
time work provide a meaningful income.

us need to think about what holds 
women back from having equality 
of wages and progression.

There is a large part to be played by Government,  
who need to legislate further and to fully enforce 
existing equality laws. But perhaps the largest 
contribution of all needs to come from all of us as  
a society, in the ways we raise our children, shape 
their expectations and ambitions and encourage  
equal aspirations without limits. How we shape our 
families, the roles we play within the home and family 
unit, the hopes and aspirations we encourage in  
boys and girls and the attitudes and language  
we use can all help shape future generations to  
eradicate bias and unfairness. 

The fact that so many women work in part-time, 
lower-paid roles in our society is a reflection of many 
things, not just the responsibilities of child-rearing and 
family commitments. Women also have traditionally 
been less confident in their abilities, less likely to 
apply for promotion or ask for wage rises and have 
historically not entered certain high paid sectors such 
as IT, banking and science. All of these issues need 
joint action from education, Government, business 
and all of us who are nurturing the next generation  
of children.

ways to help people who show 
potential for the highest roles but 
face barriers, whether they be 
family commitments, lack of skills 
and training or language skills. 

Our aim is to invest in the people we have,  
to promote from within as a first choice and to show 
long term commitment to those who come to Lush 
and want to make a fulfilling career here and achieve 
the very best they can.

We have long recognised at Lush that there is a 
danger that those working on our shop and factory 
floors on hourly rate have less flexibility of choice as 
they struggle to juggle work and family responsibilities 
on the lowest incomes. Paying the Living Wage 
Foundation’s Real Living Wage rate is part of our 
commitment to ensuring that they do not sink into  
a poverty trap.

paternity pay was in recognition 
that many were having to choose 
between career or having 
children, instead of being free  
to do both without loss. 

We also recognise that as a business, our 
responsibilities do not begin and end with those on 
our payroll. The way we treat our customers, the way 
we market our products and the way we present 
our company to the world has an impact and carries 
implicit messages. For these reasons we never make 
women feel bad about their age or their looks simply 
in order to sell beauty products to them or define our 
customers by narrow gender roles. We understand 
our female customers can be car mechanics, boys 
can love pink sparkles and others can be challenging 
the world to rethink their concept of what it is to be 
male, female or transgender.

Mind the Gap 2017LUSH0100The other strand of our responsibility as a business 
is towards those who work hard to provide us with 
ingredients. We never forget that their world and 
society is shaped by their trade with us, so here 
too we feel a responsibility to ensure that there is 
fairness and opportunity for all and that we empower 
women and marginalised groups. It’s not just in
the boardroom or on the shop floor that Lush 
pays attention to the empowerment and equality 
of women.

It’s important not to forget that we have an extended reach when it comes to the 
ingredients and materials we source to make our products. Often we have found 
that, by paying careful attention, we can find and support women through our 
trade as well. This means we reach areas of the world where female empowerment 
through trade can have real and tangible benefits.  Take for instance the remote 
Berber communities in Morocco whose expertise is in the production of  
Argan oil. For the women of these communities they view business with  
Lush as more than just a casual exchange of goods : 

“Argan oil is the symbol of rural women emancipation in Morocco”
[Fatima] Amehri [president of the women’s argan oil cooperative] says.  
“Before Lush, our women were not well fed. Before Lush the price  
was low”. – source: Quartz ; Lush – the dangerous, daring work of making  
ethical soap.

At Lush we support Maasai women’s groups in Kenya sourcing aloe; In rural  
India female artisan tailors and designers sew and print our cotton bags;  
In Northern Ghana a fair trade women’s cooperative hand process and supply  
our Shea butter. Through doing this we have found committed, talented and 
powerful women who have seized the opportunities to grow in wealth and 
confidence and in turn, provides us with meaningful trade and quality ingredients.
