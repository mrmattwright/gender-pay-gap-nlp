Just like to say I was very pleased with the friendly, professional service given by both of them. I was impressed with them, not only bringing the sofa in but also unpacking it and then taking away the packaging. For someone who is disabled, I felt that this went the extra mile. Thanks very much.  Hansi       I had a very large fridge-freezer delivered to Clacton-on-Sea on the 20/03/2018 that was very difficult to get through 2 doors. Delivery crew Anthony and Tim were absolute genius. They allayed my concern that the appliance could not get in the kitchen. They were extremely helpful and they skilfully got the appliance into the kitchen.  Marguerite Monrose       Matt and Pete delivered my sofas yesterday 5* service very professional, they asked me if I wanted my sofa unpacked and at first I said no then I changed my mind and said yes, they didn't either batter an eyelid thank you guys :)  Chantelle Neal       Regular updates on the delivery time slots and two friendly guys Terry & Nathan (Enfield) passed the parcel perfectly on time. I couldn't hear the door bell, so they called my phone. Great service! Thank you.  Katerina Lane       Brilliant experience, no problems at all. Always kept in touch and let me know the time they would be delivering . Paul Magor and Pete very friendly and polite. Thank you.  Kerry       The crew handling my collection today (P Magor & Pete) were A1, spot-on, brilliant! They called well in advance of the scheduled collection time to confirm details, and I provided some additional info. re. parking for them. All in all a very positive experience: all couriers should take note of how a good and friendly attitude goes a long, long way towards ensuring all-round customer satisfaction. Thanks so much to the guys for a job well done!
