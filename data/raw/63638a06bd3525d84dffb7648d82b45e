2017 GENDER PAY REPORT

The gender pay gap reporting requirements came into effect 
on 6 April 2017 as an amendment to the Equality Act 2010, 
requiring employers with 250 employees or more to publish 
prescribed statistics relating to UK employee pay, for publication 
before 5 April 2018 (and annually thereafter).

Gender pay gap reporting is part of the UK Government’s 
strategy to reduce the gender pay gap in a generation.

ICAS employs fewer than 250 employees but has decided to 
voluntarily publish our gender pay gap and take a leading position 
in supporting the transparency of gender pay at this time.  

“Our aim is to be a leading organisation to work for and we 
continue to promote an inclusive and flexible organisation”.

How is gender pay different  
to equal pay?

Equal pay legislation in the UK relates to an employee’s job role, 
making it unlawful for an employer to pay individuals differently  
for performing the same or similar work or work of equal value. 
ICAS uses a process of job evaluation to ensure we meet the 
requirements of equal pay legislation and we regularly benchmark  
our pay framework, with a number of other industry sectors.

We are confident that men and women at ICAS are paid equally for 
doing work that is either the same or of a similar value.

What is the gender pay gap?

The gender pay gap measures the difference between the average 
male pay and average female pay as a proportion of the average male 
pay. For example, average male pay of £10 per hour and average 
female pay of £9 per hour would indicate a gender pay gap of 10%.

Understanding the gap

While women made up 69% of our overall workforce in April 2017, only a third of Executive Director roles 
(those attracting the highest levels of remuneration), were female and almost 9 out of 10 support roles 
(those attracting the lowest levels of remuneration) were female.

Similarly, with bonus payments predominantly made to Executives, a bonus pay gap is largely driven by 
the impact of the bonus award paid to our Chief Executive.

PROVIDING FLEXIBLE WORKING OPPORTUNITIES

In 2017, as part of our policy to assist staff balance their work and home life, ICAS extended our family 
friendly policies with the introduction of Core hours flexible working; which allows all staff to have 
more flexibility in terms of when they start and finish their daily working hours and provide all staff 
with more opportunity to meet their caring responsibilities and achieve a more appropriate work-life 
balance.

CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PART-TIME WORKING 

30 of our 162 employees are employed part-time (19% of our total workforce) of which 28 out of 30 
(93%) are female. This is a high proportion of our workforce and has allowed ICAS to retain the talent 
and experience of female employees as they largely return from maternity leave.

We intend to further review how we may provide even more flexibility in terms of working hours 
and working locations in the future.

CORE AND FLEXIBLE BENEFITS 

In 2015, ICAS introduced a Tailored Health Cash Plan benefit for all staff and their dependents  
(up to age 18) to help manage health and wellbeing needs of themselves and their families.
