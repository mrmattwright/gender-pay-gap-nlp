more employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing
the pay gap between their male and female employees. The gender pay
gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and
women in a workforce.  It is important to distinguish this from Equal Pay, which deals
with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the
same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to
pay people unequally solely because of their gender.  At Reed in Partnership, we fully support the government
initiative to redress gender imbalance in the workplace.  You can read our full 2017 gender pay gap report here  Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement  Reed in Partnership is committed to ensuring that there is no
modern slavery or human trafficking in its supply chain or in any
part of our business. You can see our Slavery and Human Trafficking
