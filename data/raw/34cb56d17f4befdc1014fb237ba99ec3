Focus on Inclusion is our annual publication that tells you about our commitment to the Equality Act and the specific public sector duties. The report includes equality data about our patients and our staff.  Focus on Inclusion focuses on how we are embedding inclusion in everything we do to ensure we are at our best, consistently.  Read our Focus on Inclusion report 2018  In 2016 we announced our equality objectives to 2020 and our aims to improve the equality outcomes for patients, carers and visitors; for our workforce, and to share our leadership of inclusion across our community.  Our objectives are to:  Improve the experience of people identified by the protected characteristics when waiting for their appointment and to make information more accessible and specific to patients who have a clinical need.  Increase the diversity of people in leadership and management roles in our workforce, to continue to build a strong and positive culture of inclusion and to improve our collection of equality data.  Broaden our reach to our voluntary partners in the community to ensure we gain a wider and differing perspective through what they can offer.  Focus on Inclusion 2018 charts the progress and achievements we have made.   Equality Delivery System  The Equality Delivery System (EDS) was commissioned by the national Equality and Diversity Council and mandated by NHS England in 2015.  It is a system that helps NHS organisations improve the services they provide together with better working environments, free of discrimination, for those who work in the NHS.  It also meets the requirements of the Equality Act 2010.  The main purpose of the EDS2 is for NHS organisations to review and improve their performance for people with characteristics protected by the Equality Act 2010 and to help deliver on the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED).  During 2015, Moorfields completed the first self assessment of our performance against the Equality Delivery System.  We looked across all our action plans and other evidence and are confident that our plans will deliver year on year improvements to our current position/assessment.  Our self assessment was scrutinised by the Patient Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Steering Group in November, which prompted further action and evidence.  We believe our assessment is a balanced and honest review of our current position.  In 2016 we will turn to other NHS organisations / a specialist hospital for peer review for a more robust assessment.

We are required by law to carry out gender pay gap reporting and to publish this data on a government website by 31 March each year. We are required to publish the following:  Gender pay gap (mean and median averages)  Gender bonus gap (mean and median averages)  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure    At Moorfields, the only bonuses that are awarded are to medical staff  through the Clinical Excellence Awards  The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of all men and women across an organisation, irrespective of the jobs they do. This is different to equal pay, a legal requirement to ensure that men and women are paid the same for doing the same or equivalent work.  Our data  At Moorfields the median pay gap is 18.5% (median average hourly earnings) and the mean pay gap is 24.3% (mean average hourly earnings) – this means that the average earnings of men working at Moorfields are higher than the average earnings of women.  The gender pay gap is complex and there are a range of factors which are likely to have a bearing, for example, age, sector, the gender composition of the workplace (in particular at senior levels) and working patterns.  Our commitment to closing the gender pay gap at Moorfields  At Moorfields we are committed to ensuring the fair treatment and reward of all of our staff, regardless of gender or other protected characteristics.  We are ensuring that women are supported and encouraged to further their careers within the trust. It is acknowledged that breaks in career most often presented by maternity leave disproportionately impact women. Moorfields has flexible working policies and seeks to support women and men to manage family and career development.  We have a well-developed learning development programme for all staff and this year 87% of participants in the Mary Seacole Leadership Development programme are women.  Our robust recruitment process has equality and diversity embedded into its processes along with values based recruitment. We will continue to ensure recruitment is non-gender biased and that adverts and applicants are recruited fairly, openly and transparently. This applies equally to men seeking roles in areas traditionally dominated by women as well as ensuring equitable access to senior roles for women.
