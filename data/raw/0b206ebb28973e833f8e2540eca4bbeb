RESOURCE SOLUTIONS UK 
GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

As a global provider of outsourced recruitment services, Resource Solutions is by its very nature a people-focused business. We pride ourselves on our 
inclusivity, equality and opportunity for all. We feel strongly that the new requirement to publish data on gender pay gaps will prove to be a big step 
forward in encouraging greater transparency and positive actions to address differences in pay for men and women in the UK.

OUR GENDER PAY & BONUS GAP
Below, you can see the difference between the pay and bonuses awarded to males and females at Resource Solutions. These are divided into mean 
(the average gap) and median (the middle of the pay scale). How these are calculated is shown below.

A negative number shows where the pay or bonus is greater for females than for males.

WHAT DOES THIS REPORT TELL US? 
The data in our report is encouraging, but it’s important to point out that it 
includes both our permanent employees and our temporary staff who work 
with our clients. 

Our gender pay gap: We have a higher proportion of females than males 
who work on-site with our clients, often in more junior roles and with lower 
levels of relative pay. Our gender pay gap is therefore partly a result of more 
men occupying senior and more highly paid roles. 

Our gender bonus gap: Due to the nature of our business, we have a high 
proportion of temporary workers – people who are not typically eligible for 
bonus payments. This means that we have a lower proportion of both males 
and females receiving bonuses. 
Our gender mix by pay levels: The mix of males and females at different 
levels of pay within our business reflects that we’ve been able to attract and 
retain females at all levels of our organisation – something of which we are 
rightly proud.

IF TEMPORARY WORKERS ARE NOT 
INCLUDED IN OUR DATA… 
We are only required to provide data on our complete 
workforce, but if we were to go into the detail a bit further, 
and include data only from our permanent employees (not 
our temporary workers), on balance our gender pay gap 
looks even more encouraging. We do, however, 
recognise we can still do more to reduce the gap in the 
lower middle and upper quartile levels.

WHAT THIS DATA TELLS US

1

Our gender pay gaps are small and in 
favour of both females and males at 
different levels of our organisation.   

2

We have a performance culture 
which rewards people based on 
their contribution. 

3

40% of our leadership team is 
female – and we want to increase 
that amount.

OUR PLAN TO DO EVEN BETTER 
While our report shows that the mix of males and females at all levels of our business is strong, we recognise we can do more at the most senior levels. 
That’s one reason that we’re committing to a plan that will help us encourage women to join, stay and progress with Resource Solutions. Below, you can see
