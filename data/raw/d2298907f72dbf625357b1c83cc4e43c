gender pay gap
report 2017

What is the Gender Pay Gap?

The gender pay gap is the difference in average 
pay between men and women explained through 

several statistics. 

Is the Gender Pay Gap the same as Equal 

Pay?

The gender pay gap differs from Equal Pay in that 

it is an indication of gender development and 
career progression within an organisation. In 

contrast, Equal Pay is about a man and a woman 

receiving equal pay for doing the same or a 

similar role. As well as being committed to equal 

pay, itsu is committed to providing a fair and 
transparent working environment where all our 

people are rewarded and provided with 
opportunities to develop based on their 

performance.

Gender Pay and Bonus Gap

The mean gender pay and bonus gaps 
are the difference in average hourly pay 
as at 5th April 2017 and bonuses paid in 
the year up to 5th April 2017 for women in 

comparison to men across the whole 

business.

The median gender pay and bonus 

gaps are the mid-point. If you lined up all 
the men and all the women in itsu, the 
median pay and bonus gaps are the 
difference in average hourly pay as at 5th
April 2017 and bonuses paid in the year 
up to 5th April 2017 for the middle woman 

in comparison to the middle man.

our commitments

At itsu we are proud to be a diverse and inclusive place to work and we aim to create an environment 
where all our people have opportunities to grow and develop. We use defined and transparent pay and 
bonus structures across our business using a global grading system to ensure that all our people are paid 
fairly and equally for equivalent roles. 

We are proud that our pay gap figures are better than the UK average. In addition, our figures show that 
almost the same proportion of our male and female employees received a bonus in the year to 4th April 
2017 (less than a 2% difference) and our pay quartiles closely match that of our gender demographic. 
Whilst we celebrate these strengths, we still recognise that there are further improvements to be made. 
We therefore make the following commitments:
•

We will review each of our internal salary bands and the corresponding roles to ensure that all our 
people are firstly in the correct banding and secondly paid fairly in relation to other roles of similar 
levels of responsibility

•

We will keep on reviewing our development and succession models to ensure there is fair female 
and male representation in both our shops and our Academy [Head Office] at all levels.

I confirm the data reported is true and accurate.
