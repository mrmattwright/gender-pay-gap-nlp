Introduction 

Introduction 

Earlier this year, the Government introduced world-leading legislation that made it 

statutory for organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on their 

gender pay gap. Government departments are covered by the Equality Act 2010 

(Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which came into force 

on 31 March 2017. These regulations underpin the Public Sector Equality Duty 

and require relevant organisations to publish their gender pay gap by 30 March 

2018 (and then annually), including: the mean and median gender gaps in hourly 

pay; the mean and median gender gaps in bonus pay; the proportion of men and 

women who received bonuses; and the proportions of male and female 

employees in each pay quartile. 

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and 

women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this 

can indicate that there may be a number of issues to deal with and the individual 

calculations may help to identify what those issues are. 

The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay 

differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or 

work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a 

man or a woman. 

The Department of Health is formed of the core Department (DH) and its 

Executive Agencies, Public Health England (PHE), and the Medicines and 

Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  

The Department and its Executive Agencies support the fair treatment and reward 

of all staff irrespective of gender. The Department and its Executive Agencies pay 

approach is based on the principles of consistency, fairness and transparency, 

supporting the fair treatment and reward of all staff irrespective of gender. 

This report fulfils the Department and its Executive Agencies reporting 

requirements, analyses the figures in more detail and sets out what we are doing 

to close the gender pay gap in the organisation.

The Department and its Executive Agencies uses Civil Service grades ranging 

from Administrative Assistant to the Senior Civil Service. Each grade has a 

specific pay range.  Grades vary by levels of responsibility and each grade has a 

set pay range.  Colleagues move through the pay range as they develop their 

careers in the Department and its Executive Agencies; generally those who have 

spent longer in the same grade would be expected to earn more, regardless of

gender. For this report, hourly pay is calculated from base pay, allowances, and 

bonuses. 

79.1% of colleagues in the lower quartile of pay are women. The difference in 

hourly pay is driven by a number of factors, including the greater proportion of 

men in the Senior Civil Service (SCS) (49.2%) compared to the overall population 

(36.1%) and higher pay and higher bonus opportunity in the SCS. We will 

continue to do further work to understand this data.

The Department and its Executive Agencies performance awards were paid as a 

set value depending on grade and performance, regardless of gender. 

Men form 49.2 % of the Senior Civil Service, compared with 36.1% across the 

Department and its Executive Agencies. The performance awards are higher for 

SCS than at other grades, and this has therefore resulted in an increased bonus 

pay gap for the Department and its Executive Agencies. 

The difference in bonus pay is driven by the availability of higher bonuses in the 

SCS where there is a greater proportion of men (49.2%) compared to the overall 

population (36.1%), compounded by the fact that 79.1% of colleagues in the lower 

quartile of pay are women where the levels of bonus are smaller.

71.9% of colleagues in the lower quartile are female, compared with 54.7% in the 

upper quartile. As 63.9% of the Department and its Executive Agencies workforce 

is female, this demonstrates that the pay gap is partly as a consequence of a 

higher proportion of females occupying more junior roles.

Actions to Remove the Gender Pay Gap 

Actions to Remove the Gender Pay Gap    

The Department and its Executive Agencies are committed to addressing the 

gender pay gap and is undertaking a range of actions to reduce this including:  

  Continuing to review our recruitment policies and processes, focusing on 

attracting women into the Senior Civil Service (SCS) – including identifying and 

removing barriers for entry, anonymising the application process to reduce 

unconscious bias and ensuring interviewers have undergone unconscious bias 

training. We already operate a no single gender recruitment panel policy. In the 

core Department of Health women are 45% of SCS, MHRA 47% and PHE 

54%. 

  Actively supporting women returning to work following maternity or adoption 

leave. We offer shared parental leave and flexible working opportunities, for 

example, job share or part time working patterns, and are committed to 

ensuring those returning from maternity/adoption leave feel supported and 

welcomed. 

  Ensuring that women have the opportunity and support to develop their careers 

in the department. We support development for those from all protected 

characteristic groups through talent management schemes such as Positive 

Action Pathways and promote interventions aimed specifically at women 

including ‘Leadership Summit’, ‘Crossing Thresholds’ and ‘Top Flight’ which 

help women with potential develop their skills and confidence to progress to 

executive roles. 

  Through our pay strategies, taking targeted action in the annual pay review to 

ensure gender pay differences are addressed, where possible.   

  Ensuring that gender equality is an integral element of our Diversity and 

Inclusion Strategy. 

  Continued support for women’s network groups to provide a safe and positive 

environment for women to work in. Networks help to hold leadership teams to 

account on gender equality issues and run networking sessions, career 

development events and guest talks about issues relating to women in the 

workplace.
