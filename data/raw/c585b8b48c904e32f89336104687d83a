Social Return on Investment  Why look at social return on investment?  The questions we posed ourselves at Central England Co-operative were: what impact are we having in our communities? Are we giving our communities what they truly need?  Is it all working? And, what data do we need to plan for the future?  To answer these questions and enable us to take an evidence based approach, we worked with Social Return on Investment (SROI) specialist ‘Make a Difference CIC’.  We looked at the social value and return provided by our Community Dividend, award winning SENse to Aspire scheme and local activities organised for members.  Martyn Cheatle, Chief Executive, said: “We took the decision to undertake this new form of robust analysis of our community impact in order to inform future decision making and ensure that we continue to make a real difference to people’s lives.”  Our future strategy for community investment will be informed from the findings from this year’s report. It has identified areas and activities that deliver greater return and where CEC should focus more energy. It has also highlighted the impact that volunteering and other non-financial activities can have on the overall social return.

Community   Through our Community Dividend we redistribute 1% of our trading profit in the form of grants to local community groups across our trading area for projects such as improving school playgrounds, restoring church halls, buying special needs equipment, sporting activities, creating educational resources, building kitchen facilities and much more.  To find out if we could help fund a project in your local community, please visit the My Co-op Community website, here .  Charity  In addition to responding to requests for charitable donations in our local area, we hold events to raise money for our corporate charity, as voted for by Society employees. Our current corporate charity is the Dementia UK, which provides support and practical help to families face dementia.
