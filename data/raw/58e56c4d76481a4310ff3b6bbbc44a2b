A leadership team that has a well-balanced gender diversity brings a well-balanced perspective and way of thinking, which makes for better business decisions and business success. I am fully confident that we already have diversity in place at ADP UK, and we are committed to seeing that grow at a senior leadership level moving forward.  „           Annabel Jones, UK HR Director            “    For me, gender diversity is an extension of equality. Fundamentally, it is about being a fair organisation treating others with respect and dignity. Being a successful business is not about having one genius or a super smart elite group at the top - it is about harnessing the potential in the wider organisation and bringing it all together. If you do not have diverse leaders you cannot make it happen. You need different perspectives and experiences to create that environment. It's about harnessing talent and diversity to succeed and I truly believe that is the culture we have at ADP UK.  „       Jeff Phipps, UK General Manager                                  Rita Mitjans     Chief Diversity and Corporate Social Responsibility Officer      “ Our purpose is simple: make the world a better place by unlocking the full potential of our people. We are a global company with local expertise and a deep appreciation for our most valuable investment – our people. ADP’s commitment to diversity and inclusion is central to how we leverage this investment. It begins at the top and is threaded throughout every part of our business. At the heart of work, people create the ecosystem of ideas that allows business to grow even as the global marketplace shifts. People, by definition, are diverse and unique yet need a culture that’s inclusive in order to thrive. Diversity and inclusion are distinctive though interconnected. Diversity is often measured by demographics, but the numbers tell only one part of this story. Each person offers unique value that – influenced by variations in age, gender, race, culture and other differences – builds a launching pad for revolutionary thoughts. This diverse thinking allows the “what-ifs” to transform into the breakthroughs that inspire and improve the world of work. For its part, inclusion enables diversity to thrive. It creates fertile ground that embraces differences and integrates them into effective business strategies. You can hire in diversity, but without an inclusive culture, it will not flourish. At ADP, we believe diversity and inclusion are not only good for business, they are also necessary for long-term business success. That means weaving diversity and inclusion into the fabric of who we are, what we do and how we do it.   „      Nicole Bello     VP UK Sales      “ ADP has been very supportive of me, my family and my career progression across multiple countries and multiple roles. Being a working mum has never hindered my progress and success. Careers are like a road journey and there are times when you pull over, slow down or even stop because of self-development, family plans, caring for someone, etc. ADP gives you the opportunity to travel at the speed you like and need.    „           Lorna Wake     UK CFO     “ Diversity is not just about gender but social diversity as well. A culture of awareness and sensitivity brings different points of view together to help run a business, ADP does this very well. I feel supported and encouraged to be successful here.  „                       Our Gender Pay Gap Data                                                                                For more information on ADP UK's Gender Pay Gap Statistics and to view ADP UK's Gender Pay Report, please click on the link below:     Download the ADP UK 2017 Gender Pay Report ›                                          To know more about the UK Gender Pay regulations      Overview ›  What employer must publish ›                          HR Products    ADP Recruitment Processing Outsourcing   ADP HR Everywhere   ADP BackCheck     Payroll Products    ADP International Managed Payroll Service   ADP LocalPay   ADP Freedom   ADP AE Connect   ADP Streamline   ADP Payroll Disbursement     Time & Attendance Products    ADP ezLaborManager   ADP RealTime     HCM Products    ADP iHCM© 2   ADP® GlobalView® HCM     Investors & Media    Investor Relations   Media Centre   Press Releases         Sales: 0800 1707 677                   Privacy   Modern Slavery Statement   ADP UK's Gender Pay Report   Sitemap   Cookie preferences       ADP, the ADP logo and ADP A more human resource are registered trademarks of ADP, LLC.
