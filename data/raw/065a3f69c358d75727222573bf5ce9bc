This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it does not involve publishing individual employees' data. We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website, within one calendar year of March 30 2017.    We can use these results to assess:  • the levels of gender equality in our workplace  • the balance of male and female employees at different levels  • how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.    The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.    AVDC's gender pay gap actually bucks the current national trend. At the moment the median pay gap between male and female employees nationally is 18%; we are pleased to say that AVDC's median is -23.5%.    The other figures we are required to publish can be found here .
