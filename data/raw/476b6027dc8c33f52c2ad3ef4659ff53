For the gender pay gap to close, we need to increase the proportion of female staff, which will lead to more females progressing to senior roles. Historically we have had far more male engineering applicants than female.  There are two main factors that influence our gender pay gap in the UK. Roughly half of the gap is due to more female staff being employed in administrative roles (secretary, administrator, receptionist). The other factor is the lower number of female staff in senior positions.  Our priority is to inspire and support more women into senior roles, within a diverse workplace. We are in the process of reviewing our external recruitment channels to successfully fulfil these priorities. There are a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the visibility and appeal of our vacancies to women, and to improve retention of staff during the years when many are having families, being introduced this year.  To encourage more young females to choose STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) subjects we are supporting an outreach programme in schools in and around Cambridge. This is being spearheaded by one of our Group Leaders, with more than 100 engineers volunteering to get involved.  UK gender pay gap        Pay quartiles  This graphs shows the proportion of males and females in each pay quartile. Each quartile represents 25% of our staff.              Mean pay  Mean pay is calculated by adding together all hourly pay rates and dividing that figure by the number of employees.        The mean pay gap is calculated as follows:  (Mean hourly pay rate for men MINUS mean hourly pay rate for women) DIVIDED BY the mean hourly pay rate for men MULTIPLIED BY 100  Median pay        The median pay gap is calculated as follows:  (Median hourly pay rate for men MINUS median hourly pay rate for women) DIVIDED BY the median hourly pay rate for men MULTIPLIED BY 100  Bonus  These charts show the proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment.        Males   Receiving bonus: 351 (93.1%)  Not receiving bonus: 26 (6.9%)  Total: 377   Females   Receiving bonus: 118 (90.1%)  Not receiving bonus: 13 (9.9%)  Total: 131   We run identical bonus schemes for men and women and staff do not qualify for the scheme in their first year. The lower number of women receiving a bonus reflects an increase in the rate of female recruitment versus male for the year ending April 2017.
