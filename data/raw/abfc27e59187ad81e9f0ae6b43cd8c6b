UK Gender Pay Gap

Report 2017

Our Results

Howdens has undertaken comprehensive gender pay analysis in conjunction 
with the regulatory requirements for the first time. This shows that whilst a 
gender pay gap exists, the gap is somewhat better than the industry average. 
This portrays the Company’s on-going policy led initiatives to reduce the 
gender pay gap.

Rewards and Benefits
Our Reward and Benefit policies 
across Howdens ensure fairness 
and equitability in our approach to 
both basic salary management, but 
also to variable pay and employee 
benefits provision. Our grading 
structure, underpinned by a well 
governed job evaluation process, 
ensures roles of equal size are 
rewarded equitably.

Our Results

Across Howdens’ Group approximately 70% of our employees are male and 
30% female. Males have a larger representation than average in the upper 
quartile pay band (80/20) and a smaller than average representation in 
the lower quartile pay band (68/32).  Also, as with many other UK FTSE 
companies our leadership team comprises a majority of male incumbents.  In 
itself this gender demographic has an impact on Howdens’ overall gender pay 
position.

Our Actions
At Howdens we  continue to work to attract a diverse range of employees 
to work for us.
We operate a suite of people management policies that 
support effective recruitment, employee well-being, and 
progressive talent management. Howdens continues to 
invest heavily in developing robust succession plans. These 
people management policies, along with the enduring 
support of our leadership at all levels, helped Howdens to be 
appointed 7th position in the Time’s Best Companies awards 
for 2017 (up from 12th in 2014).

Whilst we believe we have 
come a long way in completing 
the root cause analysis of 
our gender pay gap, and are 
undertaking initiatives to 
close the gap, we are not 
complacent. We recognise 
that fairness and equitability 
in our approach to people 
management within Howdens 
is a critical element of our 
culture, which in turn is 
fundamental to our on-going 
success as a company.

Attracting, retaining, and promoting female 
talent is a key part of our people management 
strategy. The aim is not only to close the 
gender pay gap, but to recognise and nurture 
the benefits a highly skilled, capable and 
diverse workforce can contribute to the 
ongoing success of Howdens.
