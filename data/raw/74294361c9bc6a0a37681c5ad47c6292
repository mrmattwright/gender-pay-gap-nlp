our culture and business to ensure that every individual feels valued in their own 
right. 
 
We believe our gender pay gap statistics for 2017 reflect our efforts to demonstrate 
this and achieve fairness and equity in our pay.  Whilst not perfect, they are better 
than the national average, and we are committed to ongoing action to reduce the 
gaps. 
 
As part of our commitment to ensuring we have the right balance of genders and pay 
within our workforce we have been working with, and will continue to work with, 
our consultants to help us identify, review and address any underlying issues using 
appropriate tools (such as job evaluation) and good employment practices to support 
this.
