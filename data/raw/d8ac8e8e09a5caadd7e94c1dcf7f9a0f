Bellerbys Educational Services Limited (BESL) is required by law to publish an 
annual gender pay gap report. 

BESL is a legal entity of Study Group in the UK.  It delivers a range of academic 
programmes to international students via a network of proprietary and embedded 
colleges across the UK.   77% of Study Group’s UK staff are employed in the BESL 
legal entity.    

This is its report for the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.   The figures set out in this 
report above have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 

The organisation is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal 
treatment for all employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage 
or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or 
disability, and as such, continues to review its pay and reward policies to ensure that 
they are consistent with these principles.

While our gender pay gap compares favourably with external benchmarks, this is not 
a subject about which we are complacent.   We have identified a number of actions 
which we believe will help to further our aims in the area of diversity and inclusion 
and contribute to a reduced gender pay gap.  None of these initiatives will, of 
themselves, remove the gender pay gap - and it may be several years before some 
have any impact at all.  In the meantime, BESL remains committed to reporting on 
an annual basis on what it is doing to reduce the gender pay gap.
