The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and women in an organisation.  The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees. The median gender pay gap is the difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees. Nexus MAT does not award bonuses to any staff. Gender pay gap reporting does not mean that organisations have to report on equal pay.  Equal pay is about differences in the actual earnings of men and women doing equal work. Nexus MAT is an equal pay employer, using nationally agreed pay frameworks.  2017 Nexus MAT Gender Pay Gap Report ( Click here to view )            Follow us – #nexusmat  Tweets by NexusMat   Our values Recent announcements  CEO Brief Issue 5 19/02/2018  Nexus Multi Academy Trust to open two new special schools  Please click here to read more   Current Vacancies  Free School Pre-Opening Project Manager  Based at:  Nexus HQ Salary details: £52,930 – £58,388 Job details: 37 Hours, Full Time, Temporary – Fixed Term Closing date: 11 May 2018  For an informal discussion about a specific role or opportunities within the MAT, please contact Warren Carratt, Chief Executive Officer, at enquiries@nexusmat.org.
