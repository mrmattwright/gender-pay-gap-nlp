The 7 measures to report based on a “snapshot” date of 5th April 2017 are:  the mean gender pay gap  (based on hourly pay)  the median gender pay gap  (based on hourly pay)  the mean gender bonus gap  the median gender bonus gap  the proportion of men who received a bonus  the proportion of women who received a bonus  the number of men and women according to quartile pay bands  (based on hourly pay)  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and women in organisation.  This study included Full-time/Part-time/Fixed-term/Casual workers but did not include Agency staff/contract staff/paternity/leavers and staff who were receiving sick pay. ALS Laboratories (UK) Limited Gender Pay Gap Report ALS Life Sciences Gender Pay Gap Report The pay and bonus gap difference between men and women for hourly pay is 5.03% for the mean and -4.29% for the median.  The bonus paid is 59.67% for the mean and 0% for the median. Matthew Masters General Manager Europe, comments The quartiles show the male to female split of our workforce in each pay quartile. They were established by ranking our whole workforce in order of hourly pay rates from lowest to highest and then dividing them into four equally sized pay quartile groups, following which the proportions of men and women in each of the quartiles were calculated. ALS Laboratories (UK) Ltd has a salary progression system in place for the majority of roles linked to technical & behavioural competences.  This provides a framework of pay ranges that avoids any gender bias. We are pleased with the results which are reflective of our policies and proportional split of male to female employees. We will continue to monitor gender pay across our business.
