Pay & bonus gap  Difference between men and women         The table above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017). It also captures the mean and median difference between bonuses paid to men and women at Care UK Residential Care Services in the year up to 5 April 2017, i.e. for the 2016 performance year.  Bonuses           This shows that 1.9% more men were paid a bonus than women in 2016.  Pay quartiles                 The above image illustrates the gender distribution at Care UK Residential Care Division across 4 equally sized quartiles, each containing just 2,300 colleagues.  What we are doing to address the Gender Pay Gap  Our recruitment policy is and has always been to recruit the right person for the job regardless of gender, race and ethnicity. We will benchmark salaries and bonuses to ensure fair pay for the role they are recruited to do.  We have a talent strategy which focuses on performance and potential regardless of gender, race and ethnicity.  We support all colleagues by developing and promoting an inclusive culture through excellent recognition schemes and employee involvement programmes.  We support requests for flexible working and have a good mix of full time and part time colleagues.  These statistics demonstrate that we employ more women than men across the division; this is consistent across the healthcare sector. The data presented confirms that we are paying people fairly based on their skills and qualifications. We are committed to supporting colleagues at all levels to learn new skills and to providing opportunities for career development. Our recruitment and retention strategy affirms our approach to fairness and equal opportunities for all.  I confirm the data reported is accurate.
