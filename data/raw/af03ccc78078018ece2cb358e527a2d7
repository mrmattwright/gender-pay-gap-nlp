“I welcome this legislation and the opportunity to outline 
Stork’s commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive
workforce.

Wewill continue to promote and encourage diversity and 
will use our Gender Pay Gap findings to shape our 
business plans in the forthcoming years."

Declaration:
I confirm that the gender pay gap data and calculations 
in this report are accurate and have been produced in 
accordance with the regulations.

The gender pay gap differs
from equal pay, as it is  

concerned with the

differences in the average pay 

between men and women 
over a period of time, no 

matter what their role. Equal 

pay deals with  the pay 

differences between men and 

women  who carry out the

same or similar jobs.
