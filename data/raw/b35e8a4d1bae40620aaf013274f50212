 
Gender Pay Gap Report 2017-18 

 
 
As an employer of more than 250 people The Brendoncare Foundation is required to 
publish an annual gender pay gap report.  This is the first report under the new 
regulations.  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in the average 
earnings of men and women, expressed as a percentage of the hourly rate of male 
employees.  This is different from equal pay and we are confident that men and 
women are paid equally for the same or similar roles.

Understanding the gap 
At Brendoncare our workforce is predominantly female, with women 
representing 81% of the overall staff team, which is reflective of the care 
sector as a whole.  We are proud that we have significant representation of women 
across the organisation in senior posts.  We have a small gender pay gap of 3.09% 
(median) and this reflects the slightly higher proportion of male employees in the 
upper quartiles. Small bonus payments are made to staff who meet attendance and 
training standards and we also make bonus payments to care home managers 
(80% of whom are female).  Our bonus payments are based on clear quantitative 
measures and do not rely on subjective judgements.  
 
We will continue to take steps to promote gender equality. We maintain a fair and 
transparent pay policy.  We are committed to offering all staff opportunities 
to progress to higher paid roles and invest in training and development to 
ensure we have an effective workforce and that individuals are supported 
to achieve their full potential.
