Diversity and Inclusion at Intel  At Intel, a fully diverse and inclusive workplace is fundamental to how we serve our customers and deliver results. In 2015 our CEO set an aggressive goal in changing the face of our workforce and called on the rest of the industry to join Intel in making Diversity and Inclusion a new force in technology to help shape the future. Since then Intel has led the industry in transparency of our data and progress to our goal.  At Intel, men and women are paid equally for equivalent jobs with similar tenure regardless of gender. Pay parity is under regular review and market adjustments are made regularly regardless of gender. We view pay parity as a signal of the overall health of our company as well as a means of ensuring equity for all employees.  Our recent deep analysis of our UK compensation data confirms that there is zero statistically significant pay difference by gender. The UK gender pay data we’re publishing today reflects a lower representation of women in senior roles. This is a gap we – and the entire technology industry – are working hard to address. We continue to improve representation and progression opportunities for women at Intel, in all the countries in which we do business.  Intel has, and will continue to take active steps globally to drive gender equality by:   Implementing Inclusive hiring practices to ensure among other things that work is defined using unbiased job descriptions, recruiters source a high performing talent pool of both men & women and interview panels are diverse.
