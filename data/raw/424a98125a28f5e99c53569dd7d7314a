We aim to recruit and develop employees from all backgrounds and create an inclusive working environment.                   Overcoming challenges    Initiatives such as training to prevent unconscious bias, are making BAE Systems a more inclusive place to work. But we still face significant challenges in improving diversity – from recruiting more women and candidates from diverse backgrounds to replacing the skills and experience we are losing as our ageing workforce retires.   We are determined to bridge the historical gender gap in our industry by encouraging more women to join the company, celebrating our women engineers and promoting development to increase the number of women in senior executive positions.  Our executive recruiting process is designed to draw from diverse candidate lists. Mentoring and sponsorship programmes are in place to promote a more diverse leadership pipeline.   We also aim to develop a pipeline of diverse talent by encouraging young people including young women to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers.     UK gender pay gap reporting    We value our people and the contribution they make. We pay them fairly for the work they do and we aim to create a working environment where there are equal opportunities for all our people so they can fulfil their potential and contribute to our business success, irrespective of their gender.    The Government has introduced regulations for gender pay gap reporting for companies in the UK. The regulations are intended to encourage employers to take informed action to close their gender pay gaps where one exists.    In our 2017 report we have published our gender pay data for our UK workforce and for our UK legal entities with 250 or more employees, as required by the regulations.  The report also outlines our actions and commitments to improve the gender balance of our UK workforce.
