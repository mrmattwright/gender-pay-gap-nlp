The Gender Pay Gap is different to the Equal Pay Gap. The key differences are:   Equal Pay deals with pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value;  Gender Pay Gap shows the difference in the average pay between men and women.   Gender pay reporting is not a review of equal pay for equal work; it instead compares hourly rates of pay and any bonuses staff may receive by gender, seeking to expose any imbalance.  Following further analysis of the results, some assumptions can be made about why the current pay gap exists. The analysis and findings allow North Wales Police to understand where to direct positive action interventions in order to close the gender pay gap in future years.  The figures below include all police officers and police staff who were employed by North Wales Police on the "snapshot date", which was 31 st March 2017.  The mean average is calculated by adding together all of the numbers in a set and then dividing the sum by the total count of numbers. The median is calculated by arranging each number in order by size; the number in the middle is the median.  The mean and median pay gap  Women’s hourly rate is:   Mean 14.7% lower than males  Median 17.3% lower than males   The mean and median bonus pay gap  Women’s bonus pay is:   Mean 23.4% lower than males  Median 0% lower than males   Proportion of male and female employees receiving a bonus payment   Male 0.4%  Female 1.0%   Proportion of male and female employees in each salary quartile band  Top quartile   Male 75.3%  Female 24.7%   Upper middle quartile   Male 61.1%  Female 38.9%   Lower middle quartile   Male 45.3%  Female 54.7%   Lower quartile   Male 37.2%  Female 62.8%   The pay for both police officers and staff is determined nationally.  Our analysis shows that on average the pay points for police officers are at a higher rate than police staff and as there are more police officers than police staff this contributes to the current gender pay gap.  North Wales Police also has more male police officers than female police officers, and more female police staff in lower graded roles, which has the overall effect of exacerbating the current pay gap.  North Wales Police has recognised that it needs to make efforts to tackle under-representation in the police service. Attracting more females to join as police officers and improving progression for both female police officers and female police staff continues to be a key priority within North Wales Police’s Positive Action Strategy and Delivery Plan.  North Wales Police will continue to encourage more females to join as police officers, and this remains a key priority. This has led to a variety of initiatives aimed at increasing representation of females and applicants from across all protected characteristics.    What North Wales Police is already doing to address the Gender Pay Gap   North Wales Police has a specific Positive Action Working Group that has established the Positive Action Strategy and Delivery Plan which supports our activities in this area.  North Wales Police are encouraging more females to join as police officers by utilising recruitment strategies and initiatives aimed at increasing representation of females - this is already having a positive effect.  North Wales Police has a staff support group, Women’s Association of North Wales Police (WANWP), dedicated to supporting women within the workplace. This is led by senior female leaders within the organisation, and continues to raise and identify issues, obstacles and challenges affecting females in policing.  North Wales Police has proactively supported targeted seminars and workshops to familiarise potential candidates with the application process and to provide the opportunity to ask questions. This has included familiarisation days for areas under-represented by women, e.g. Firearms and Police Support Unit (PSU).  Consideration is given to alternative specialist equipment and uniform for women where appropriate.  North Wales Police are continuing to run annual ‘Springboard’ developmental courses, which help to provide confidence to women who are aspiring to develop and support to achieve their goals.  Flexible Working across North Wales Police is available to ensure that officers and staff with caring responsibilities are supported and to encourage a good work-life balance.  All police staff roles are “job evaluated”, in conjunction with the recognised trade union, which ensures that roles are evaluated fairly and consistently.  North Wales Police prioritises employee wellbeing, having signed up to the Mind Time to Change Pledge and the College of Policing Blue Light Framework in 2018, and has a wide range of services that provide wellbeing support to all officers and staff.  All job opportunities are now advertised externally as well as internally to enable as broad a range of applicants as possible.     What North Wales Police will also do to address the Gender Pay Gap   North Wales Police is recruiting a Positive Action Officer to implement the aforementioned Positive Action Strategy and Delivery Plan.  Attracting more females to join as police officers will remain a key priority over the coming years.  The proportion of female Special Constables is currently 47.3%. Applications for the role of police officer often come from Special Constables. North Wales Police therefore expects this to contribute to reducing the gender pay gap for police officers in the longer term.  North Wales Police will continue to review police officer promotion processes and how we might better support females in applying for and securing more senior officer roles.  North Wales Police will continue to amplify the work of senior female officers and staff, and those in specialist roles, to improve visibility of role models and demonstrate potential career paths.  North Wales Police will continue to run specific initiatives that aim to improve career and development pathways for female police officers and staff.     Conclusion  The figures set out above were calculated using standard methodologies within the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017. The report finds that the mean gender pay gap is 14.7%.  It can already be seen that the work undertaken in recent years has had a positive impact on the recruitment of female officers into North Wales Police. North Wales Police are committed to highlight the plans that are being implemented to reduce the Gender Pay Gap and will report the findings on an annual basis.
