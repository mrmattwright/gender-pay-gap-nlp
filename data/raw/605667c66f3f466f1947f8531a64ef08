As we’ve taken major steps to improve gender diversity across all of Severn Trent in recent years, we welcomed the opportunity to report our figures, especially as our mean pay gap was just 2.4% which is significantly better than national and industry averages.  On top of that, the difference in mean bonus between male and female employees was -49.2%, with our move to an all company bonus meaning that 85.9% of men and 80.8% of women received a bonus payment during the year.  We know we want to do more as we look to further improve gender diversity across the whole company and make further strides to close the gender pay gap.
