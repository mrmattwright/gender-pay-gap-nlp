In 2000, Romec was launched as a fully-fledged facilities management company  In 2002, a joint venture was created between Balfour Beatty Workplace, part of the Balfour Beatty Group, and Royal Mail.  In 2013, Balfour Beatty sold its 49% share of Romec to Engie, through its primary brand Cofely.  In 2016, Royal Mail bought Cofely’s 49% share in Romec and Romec became a wholly owned Royal Mail business.  In 2017 the Romec and Royal Mail Group Property companies combined and are known  as ‘Royal Mail Property & Facilities Solutions’.   Our Values  Our values are at the heart of everything we do.

With this in mind we focus our annual safety training on the areas identified as highest risk, as follows:    Working at Height - In 2016 our Annual Safety Training focussed on this area to remind employees of the correct control measure to take when working at height.    Manual handling - In 2015-16 we engaged with a specialist training provider,  to train the workforce in the correct manual handling techniques which are refreshed annually.    Keeping employees healthy is also crucial to our people strategy. Mental health has been a major focus for us in 2016–17 which saw the company commit to the 'Time to Change' pledge with Mind, which aims to remove the stigma and raise awareness of mental health conditions.
