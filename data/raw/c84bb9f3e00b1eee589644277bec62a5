Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay – equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work or equal value. It is unlawful to not pay equal pay because of gender.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with, and the individual calculations may help to identify those issues.  The Trust must publish six calculations showing:   The average gender pay gap as a mean average  The average gender pay gap as a median average  The average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average  The average bonus gender pay gap as a median average  The proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and the proportion of females receiving a bonus payment  The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band     The Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust Gender Pay Gap Reports can be found below.
