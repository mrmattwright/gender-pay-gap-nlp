    Gala Leisure Ltd  Gender Pay Gap Report 2017                                                   What is the gender pay gap?  Gender pay gap reporting requirements arise under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 (cid:894)(cid:862)the Regulatio(cid:374)s(cid:863)(cid:895) which came into force on 6 April 2017. Under the Regulations, companies with over 250 employees are required to publish prescribed gender pay gap information on an annual basis.     It is important to note that the gender pay gap is different from equal pay. The gender pay gap measures the differences between the pay of male and female colleagues across the workforce, expressed as a perce(cid:374)tage of (cid:373)ale(cid:859)s ear(cid:374)i(cid:374)gs. Conversely, equal pay concerns pay differences between male and female colleagues performing equal work. The gender pay gap does not measure equal pay, it is an entirely different concept. The existence of a gender pay gap does not necessarily mean that there are unequal pay practices within an organisation, rather there can be a number of different reasons for a gender pay gap for example, a gender imbalance in the different types of roles withi(cid:374) a(cid:374) e(cid:373)ployer(cid:859)s organisation for socio-economic reasons due to employees of one gender taking up more part time work due to childcare responsibilities.    Introduction   At Gala Leisure Ltd, we are proud to put our people at the heart of our business. We are committed to the principle of equal opportunities, regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Our policies are designed to treat everyone fairly and equally.  We believe that transparency around gender pay data will be invaluable in helping employers drive action to create working environments that are fairer and more inclusive for employees. We therefore welcome the Government(cid:859)s initiative which will undoubtedly help to increase awareness, prompt questions and help us to challenge ourselves to improve pay equality.    We focus on developing careers in a flexible and supportive working environment and we are committed to being an equal pay employer.   We recognise the importance of reporting our gender pay gap with absolute transparency and, as a result, will continue to evolve and take the appropriate action to enable our colleagues to grow to their full potential within our business and ultimately close the gap. Our aim will be to challenge ourselves and ask, (cid:862)What can we do to close the gap?(cid:863)  We recognise that closing our gender pay gap will take time, however, we are confident that we can do so over time.   Chris Matthews  Chief Executive Officer      Our Business  We employ almost 4,000 people across England and Scotland within  over 120 bingo clubs and two club support centres. The large majority  of our workforce is female.    Our male to female ratio                How are the median and mean gender pay gaps calculated?  Under the Regulations, there are two ways to calculate the gender pay gap: the median gender pay gap and the mean gender pay gap.   If we stood all our female colleagues in a line and all our male colleagues in a line, the median pay gender pay gap would be calculated by finding the difference between the hourly rate of pay for the middle female compared to the hourly rate of pay for the middle male.  The mean gender pay gap is calculated by finding the difference between the average hourly rate of pay for females compared to the average hourly rate of pay for males.     44% 56% FemaleMale70% 30% When it comes to senior management roles, 44% of these are female, compared to 56% male.     Our gender pay gap findings  The gender pay gap calculations are based on pay data from the relevant pay period which straddles the (cid:858)snapshot date(cid:859) of 5 April 2017 and which includes basic pay, allowances, bonus pay and pay for leave.   Gala Leisure Ltd’s gender pay gap:              Median                                                                                                             Mean                      *The UK national average gender pay gap is approximately 18.4%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) do not provide the gender pay gap statistics specifically for the retail sector but provide statistics for the sales and customer services (SACS) industry within which we believe retail would fall. For the SACS industry, the percentage difference in the median male and female earnings in April 2017 was 3.6%. As noted above, our median statistics are much lower than this average.       25.44% 0.78%     29% 71% LOWER QUARTILE  Our pay quartiles   In accordance with the Regulations, we have divided Gala(cid:859)s workforce into four equal pay quartiles. The proportion of male and female colleagues in each pay quartile is as follows:                             Proportion of males and females who received a bonus:   55% 45% UPPER QUARTILE  36% 64% UPPER MIDDLE QUARTILE  Gala Leisure Ltd’s gender bonus gap:  Median  92.86% Mean 69.31%   28% 72% LOWER MIDDLE QUARTILE Our gender bonus gap findings   Our gender bonus gap is calculated by reference to bonus payments received by male and female colleagues in the twelve-month period preceding 5 April 2017.   Employees who sit in our upper pay quartile received the highest proportion of bonus payments as our bonus scheme applies to those in senior roles within the organisation. The reason for the gender bonus gap is because the majority of employees in management and senior roles that are eligible for bonus payments are male. As our bonus scheme does not apply to club colleague roles, this means that a large proportion of our female colleagues are not eligible for a bonus which has resulted in an inflated gender bonus gap. We do however, use ad hoc incentives for our colleagues who are not part of our bonus scheme.  The results tell us that we have a larger number of females in the lower, lower middle and upper middle quartiles, whilst the majority of our upper quartile consists of males.   In accordance with the Regulations, the proportion of males and females who received a bonus is as follows:  Males  36.69% Females 25.23%         Our Commitments   The report this year tells us that there is more work to be done to reduce both our mean gender pay gap and mean and median gender bonus gaps. In particular, by encouraging more women into senior roles that attract bonus payments. At Gala Leisure Ltd, we recognise the importance of having a diverse workforce and we will continue to explore ways in which we can improve this position. We are also looking at bonus and initiatives for our non-management roles.    So far, we are rebuilding and reviewing:   Our Bonus Scheme Structure  We will be reviewing our bonus scheme structure with a view to having an equitable and a more inclusive approach to any bonus scheme for all levels of colleagues within our organisation.   Reward and Recognition We will continue to coach our line managers on the merits of providing regular and constructive feedback to help inspire female colleagues to progress within the organisation.   Benefits  We will review our current benefits portfolio with a view to becoming an employer of choice committed to gender pay equality and diversity. We are looking at options for introducing a flexible benefits scheme that will allow colleagues to choose how to use the investment the company has put aside for benefits.    Talent and Resource Planning  We recognise that there is more to do to develop a pipeline of female leaders particularly in the more senior roles. We are focusing on encouraging females in our lower and lower middle quartiles to progress in their roles and to move into more senior positions. We have introduced a Certificate in Leisure Leadership management development programme in association with Derby University to help develop our leaders of the future; currently 42% of the learners are female and 58% are male. We will continue to encourage more female learners to join this management development programme.    Apprenticeships  We are launching our second cohort of apprenticeships to grow and develop our colleagues internally and to maintain a focus on encouraging females into apprenticeship roles. Take up on Cohort 1 of our Apprenticeships was most successful with females with 63 females and 32 males joining. Nominations for Cohort 2 currently sit at 105 females and 51 males. We anticipate that these people will help build our pipeline for participants into the Certificate in Leisure Leadership management development programme and increase female participation of that programme.          Family Friendly Working Practices We are reviewing our focus on working parents and carers and our flexible working policy to ensure our organisation remains flexible and inclusive for existing colleagues and for those joining us. We will also make our family-friendly policies more flexible and agile to promote shared parental care and go over and above the requirements put in place by the government.      The Future   We are committed to reducing our gender pay gap and to continue to encourage our talented female colleagues to progress their career with us into more senior roles.   We will continue to offer diverse and equal opportunities to all our colleagues, actively encourage flexible working across every level and every role in our organisation, and use our data to actively reduce our gender pay gap.   I, Karen McKeever, Human Resources Director, confirm that the information in this statement is accurate.
