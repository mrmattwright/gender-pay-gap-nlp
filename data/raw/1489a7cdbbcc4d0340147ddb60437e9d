GENDER PAY REPORT 

UK 2018 

This report focuses on data around gender pay at Korn Ferry UK. We recognize that this is 
an issue of business effectiveness for our clients and ourselves: businesses that are more 
diverse are more successful. We are proud of what we have achieved and of the actions we 
will continue to invest in.

Korn Ferry compensates based on market and benchmark data, and reflective of factors 
such as employees’ roles, the location of their job, experience level, and performance. As a 
firm we are committed to paying all of our employees equitably. 

When I joined Korn Ferry in September 2010 as a Senior Client Partner in Financial 
Services, I had a clear path professionally and personally. Seven years and three 
promotions later, I am now responsible for a UK & Ireland business of 900 people. And 
while work is rewarding, most important to me is family. At Korn Ferry, our flexible 
schedules and creative approaches are key to helping me balance multiple responsibilities 
while ascending through various leadership positions in the firm.

I am one example of many. However, as a firm we will not rest on our laurels.   We’re 
continuing to invest in diversity and inclusion initiatives across the employee lifecycle - 
hiring, performance, promotions, and compensation decisions - and we continue to help 
our leaders identify and develop employees.

We believe that greater diversity and inclusion leads to more rewarding and successful 
workplaces. We know that when people of different backgrounds, perspectives, skills, and 
passions come together with shared purpose, amazing things happen.

The gender pay gap

Pay equity is a key economic, social and political issue worldwide. More than 80 countries 
have some form of equal pay for equal work legislation and roughly 24 countries require 
some form of mandatory reporting on gender pay equity. Korn Ferry supports and 
embraces the progress that is being made across businesses, not just because it is a legal 
requirement, but because it is the right thing to do; and not only because it is the right 
thing to do, but because it makes business sense. On average, men do earn more than 
women around the world, but our proprietary data tells a more nuanced story, and helps to 
clarify the difference between ‘equal pay’ and the ‘gender pay gap’.

What We Know

Korn Ferry collects pay data in more than 
110 countries, covering more than 20 
million individuals. For more than 12 million 
of these people, across more than 70 
countries, we have gender data alongside 
our pay data — giving us a unique insight 
into gender pay equity. This external data 
collected in our PayHub database shows 
that globally men, on average, earn 17.6% 
more than women — this is often referred 
to as the ‘gender pay gap’. However, if 
we focus on comparable levels of work 
- jobs at the same professional level — 
the gap shrinks to 6.5%. And, when we 
narrow the data to represent the same 
role, level, company and function, the gap 
is only 1.6% — much closer to ‘equal pay 
for equal work’. This trend is consistent 
in every country analysed, all around 
the world. “Equal pay for equal work” 
and the “gender pay gap” are different 

things. Most organisations are finding that 
although they pay men and women the 
same for doing the same jobs, they still 
have a significant gender pay gap. This 
is because there are fewer women in the 
higher paying jobs — usually the most 
senior jobs, but also jobs in the highest 
paying functions like engineering and 
technology.

As one of the world’s largest providers 
of gender pay analytics and diversity & 
inclusion consulting services, we have 
seen how greater diversity and inclusion 
lead to more successful and rewarding 
workplaces. And while we partner with 
others outside our firm to tackle their 
challenges in this regard, we do not lose 
sight of the need to continue to deliver on 
our own.

What the numbers reveal

Regulatory mandates, while well intended, 
require the reporting of data that combine 
salaries at all levels, women and men, 
regardless of role. The resulting statistics 
across the professional services sector 
show inequality in gender pay. Women 
have made greater strides into the 
upper levels of leadership, but have not 
yet matched the numbers of their male 
colleagues.

The current mean pay gap (the total of all 
salaries, divided by the number of people) 
of 30.1% for our UK workforce, while 
accurate in terms of regulatory reporting 
parameters, does reveal a skewed picture.

Salary and bonuses are impacted by 
a number of factors: employees’ roles, 
their location, their experience and their 
performance. Across the UK, we have a 
gender balanced workforce: 55% women 

and 45% men. However, the data shows 
that there are fewer women at the senior 
executive level, where pay is highest. While 
women make up 55% of the Korn Ferry UK 
workforce, they occupy only 35% of upper 
quartile positions. As stated earlier, this is 
the challenge for the professional services 
sector: continuing to attract, retain, and 
develop the best female talent and bring 
more women into leadership positions.

We will continue to focus on delivering 
an inclusive and high-performing culture 
while creating a diverse talent pipeline 
as we compete for, attract, retain, and 
develop the best talent.  We need to 
ensure that we maintain a workplace 
culture in which women choose to 
stay engaged, rise up the ranks and 
increasingly serve in leadership roles at the 
top.

Across the UK, we have a gender balanced 
workforce: 55% women and 45% men. 
However, the data show that there are fewer 
women at the senior executive level, where 
pay is highest. These comparisons showcase 
an important talent challenge: the ongoing 
need to ensure that desire and talent alone 
are responsible for those promoted into senior 
and leadership positions.

Most organisations, including our own, are 
finding that although they pay men and 
women the same for doing the same jobs, 
they still have a significant gender pay gap. 
This is because there are fewer women in 
the higher paying jobs — usually the most 
senior jobs across all levels — but also 
jobs in the highest paying functions like 
engineering and technology.

Tackling the gender gap within the UK and beyond

Like many of the clients we serve, Korn 
Ferry has been working to invest in a 
purpose-driven culture, increase female 
representation and contribution firm-wide 
and create an even more gender-diverse 
pipeline.

We are actively working to attract, develop, 
and retain an increasing number of talented 
women and people from underrepresented 
populations in our workforce at all levels. 

Unconscious Bias Training

In 2018, we launched mandatory 
unconscious bias training into our 
promotions process. This training helps 
our people understand the logic behind 
unconscious bias and learn tactics for 
avoiding the pitfalls associated with it; 
increase awareness of our own and others’ 
potential biases and how and when those 
reactions can influence decisions about 
candidate readiness for promotion; and 
determine ways to mitigate bias in our 
promotion process to ensure objective 
decision-making and better outcomes. 

UK and Ireland Diversity and Inclusion 
Culture Forum

Working across four strands of activity 
(health and well-being, knowledge 
sharing, corporate social responsibility, 
and social activities) this team builds and 
delivers a calendar of initiatives across our 
UK business to engage everyone more 
meaningfully within the firm. The forum 
meets monthly and is responsible for 
defining and leading delivery of initiatives 
that improve workplace engagement. 

Inclusion Benefits

Our benefits programs enable us to attract, 
develop and promote our people without 
having to put their personal lives on hold.

We are proud to offer our employees: 

  Enhanced maternity pay & leave — Our 
pay and leave go beyond the statutory 
requirements. While statutory obligations 
require 6 weeks at 90% pay before 
moving to the statutory capped rate, 
we offer 18 weeks of maternity leave at 
100% pay, with an additional 6 weeks at 
50% pay, plus 15 weeks at the statutory 
capped rate.

  Encourage & support parental leave — 
This form of leave allows both mothers 
and partners to share maternity leave. 
While this is a statutory requirement, we 
actively promote this practice within the 
firm.

  Promote and encourage flexible working 

arrangements — Whether this is a 
homeworking or flexible-hour model, we 
work with individual employees to create 
an arrangement that best fits with their 
lifestyle and family commitments. 

At Korn Ferry, we are proud that we 
have an employee workforce with over 
half comprised of talented women who 
each day demonstrate passion, strength, 
determination and embody the values of the 
firm. Like the clients we serve, Korn Ferry 
must continue to progress — but we are 
proud of the direction we are headed. Our 
firm is not only about serving clients — we 
value making an impact and a difference in 
our world.

Statutory disclosures and other relevant data 
points

Korn Ferry UK has one legal entity with at least 250 employees for which we are required 
to report our gender pay gap data. As required by the regulations, we report both mean 
and median data. The mean is the total of all salaries, divided by the number of people 
(commonly known as the ‘average’); whereas the median is the salary for the ‘middle’ 
employee, where half of employees earn more and half earn less. Bonuses are one 
component of an individual’s total compensation that may vary from year to year and are 
awarded based on the accomplishment of specific, objective performance metrics.
