We make a small charge for works or repairs, such as plumbing, alterations, assembling flat-pack furniture or shelving, putting up curtain rails and installing key safes etc. As part of our falls-prevention scheme, the handyman will complete a Homecheck to minimise the risk of falls, installing both internal and external rails free of charge. To find out more about the Handy Person Scheme, watch our short video and see our Handy person scheme page for further details and to download an application form.
