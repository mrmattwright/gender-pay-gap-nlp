GENDER PAY GAP INFORMATION 

1.  Introduction 

The legislation governing gender pay gap reporting is contained in the Equality Act 2010 
(Specific Duties) (Scotland) Regulations 2012. The duty requires public organisations 
with 20 or more employees to publish a gender pay gap information on the National 
Museums Scotland website.   

We are also obligated to report on our gender pay gap information on the UK 
Governments online service by the reporting deadline of 4 April 2018. This information 
must be signed off as being accurate and calculated in accordance with the regulations 
and the guidance provided through Acas by the Chief Executive of the individual 
organisation. The Director of National Museums Scotland has confirmed that these 
regulations have been met.  

National Museums Scotland is a Non Departmental Public Body and a registered charity 
and is registered at the Government Equalities Office under the private and voluntary 
sector and therefore must publish the data by 4 April 2018. 

The data required to be published is as follows: 

•  Mean gender pay gap 
•  Median gender pay gap 
•  Mean bonus gender pay gap  
•  Median bonus gender pay gap 
•  Proportion of males and females receiving a bonus 
•  Proportion of males and females in each quartile band 

  

2.  Gender Pay Gap at National Museums Scotland 
 
The current gender pay gap information for National Museums Scotland is set out in 
Tables 1 to 4  at Appendix 1 and has been derived from salary information (excluding 
overtime) as at 5 April  2017. It should be noted that no bonuses are paid to any staff in 
National Museums Scotland and therefore there is no data to be made available.    
 
As at the snapshot date 5 April 2017 National Museums Scotland employed 178 males 
and 260 females .There were approximately 20% more female staff than male staff in 
employment which has been the position for a number of years.   
 
The mean hourly pay for male staff is £13.19 and for female staff is £13.78.  The current 
mean gender pay gap for all staff across our published pay scales at National Museums 
Scotland is £ 0.59 or 4.47% in favour of female staff. The median gender pay gap is 
£1.63 or 15% in favour of female staff. This overall gender pay gap might be considered 
atypical. However, this must be considered alongside the fact that the work of National 
Museums Scotland, like many other national museums, covers a broad range of 
specialisms. This tends to lead to gender clustering in different work groups and produce 
this type of pattern in the gender pay analysis.

We have also reviewed gender pay gap information in the context of occupational 
segregation which we understand as the concentration of men and women: 
 

• 
• 

in different kinds of jobs (horizontal segregation) 
in different pay grades (vertical segregation 

 
 
As no member of staff receives a bonus then this does not distort either the mean or 
median figures. The higher median gender pay gap in favour of female staff will arise 
from the fact that more females than males are employed in both the Upper and the 
Upper Middle quartile and in the organisation as a whole. Typically these are Curatorial, 
professional, middle and senior management roles. There are also more females than 
males in the most senior management roles in the organisation which represents a much 
more positive picture than many comparable organisations. 
 
There are, however more females than males employed in the lower quartile which 
mainly represent cleaning and front of house Visitor Experience staff. Overall it should 
be noted that there is a higher proportion of staff in both Visitor Experience and in the 
Curatorial departments than the rest of the organisation.  
 
The Lower Middle quartile is the only quartile where there are more males than females 
employed. Stereotypically the roles in this quartile are in security and support services.  
It reflects that men are disproportionately employed in roles in the lower middle quartile 
which leads to the lower hourly rate figure presented.  
 
We continue to be proactive as an organisation in ensuring there is no bias in our 
recruitment and selection practices, and are currently undertaking a review of these in 
line with best practice. In particular, we will be considering of how we present jobs as 
part of any recruitment campaigns in attracting a wider pool of potential recruits for posts 
especially in the lower and lower middle quartile. We ensure that all managers are 
trained in Recruitment and Selection best practice and in Equality and Diversity before 
they can support any recruitment campaign.   
 
In line with National Museums Scotland’s commitment to achieve equal opportunities for 
all staff, the organisation supports the principles that all employees should receive equal 
pay for the same or like work or work rated as equivalent or of equal value, and in order 
to achieve this will endeavour to maintain a pay system that is fair and transparent. Job 
evaluation,  using  the  Hay’s  system  is  objectively  used  for  all  posts  and  pay  scales. 
These criteria are applied equally to males and females as is all aspects of reward and 
remuneration. We generally appoint at the lowest 25% of pay bandings which is applied 
regardless of gender. 
 
We have a pay structure at National Museums Scotland that is based on grades B 
through to 8 and contained within grades 6 to grade B there are established progression 
steps. Staff are eligible for a progression payment if they are not at the maximum of their 
scale. In recognition that men more generally in employment have less interrupted 
career paths than women, we ensure that progression is not affected by for instance 
periods of maternity leave, caring responsibilities, etc. and therefore progress for women 
through an individual scale is at the same rate as it is for men.  
 
Beyond these assumptions, we would regard the overall mean pay gap between male 
and female staff to be modest (i.e. less than 5% in favour of females) but we do remain

addressing any issues that become apparent. All equalities information is published on 
our website in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland) 
Regulations 2012.
