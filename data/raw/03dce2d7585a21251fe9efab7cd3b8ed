The data related to the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.  At this date 36.2% of the workforce was 
male and 63.8% was female.  The figures show that Horizon Care and Education Group has a mean 
gender pay gap of 7.1% and a median gender pay gap of -0.2%.

Female earnings are: 
7.1% lower than males 
0.2% higher than males 
2.1% lower than males 
47.8% higher than males 

 

In common with the social care sector, our organisation is predominately female.  The number of 
females is greater than the number of males in each level(quartile) of the organisation. 

 

The male/female split of the company is broadly reflected in the lower and lower/middle quartiles, 
with more females being in the upper middle quartile and slightly less in the upper quartile. 

60.1% of males were paid a bonus and 62.3% of females. Bonus payments are based on performance 
and the results show little variation between males and females. 

 

Our aim during the next 12 months will be reduce further the gap in the upper quartile to reflect the 
overall male and female split within the company.
