JPM are experts in making this happen. That philosophy has helped us to grow into a nationwide service employing over 1500 staff. We’re still privately owned, proud of the service we offer and as passionate as ever – reflected in the fact that many of our clients have stayed with us for decades and most of our new business comes from referrals.  Our structure ensures we continue to meet the exacting standards we’ve set for ourselves. All managers and supervisors report directly to our directors, who continue to remain personally involved in the day-to-day running of every contract.  What really sets us apart is our innovative OASIS audit software. Developed in-house, OASIS makes it easy to keep track of every aspect of our service level agreement, making us completely accountable at all times. It collates a library of reports, manuals and important health and safety information which is at your disposal and allows you to provide instant feedback to which we will respond immediately.
