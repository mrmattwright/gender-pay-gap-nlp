The gender pay gap simply shows the difference in the average hourly earnings of men and women regardless of their roles in a business. Our gap is not caused by men and women being paid differently to do the same job but rather by the inherent nature of the structure of a workforce working within the retail sector whereby many more women than men are employed in customer-facing roles within our stores.  Our workforce is split 78% women to 22% men, a statistic we are proud of and one that enables a great many women the opportunity to develop challenging and rewarding careers with us.
