We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent 
jobs across our business.
The Acorn Group is a full service property 
company operating from over 30 locations 
with several key divisions including, residential 
sales, residential lettings, block management, 
financial services, land and commercial. This 
breadth of activity along with our in-house 
Training Academy provides all our team with 
the opportunity to fulfil their potential and to 
develop a range of skills within the property 
sector. 
“Gender pay gap” is the difference in the 
average hourly rate of pay between “all” 
men and “all” women in a company. This 
is very different from “Equal Pay” which is 
the difference between a man and a woman 

who carry out the same or similar jobs. We 
are confident that men and women are paid 
equally for doing equivalent jobs across our 
business although performance related pay 
(which is transparent to our employees) will 
allow top performers (regardless of gender)  
to increase earnings over their peers.  
As is normal in our sector a large proportion 
of our team receive performance related 
pay. Reporting guidelines stipulate that this 
variable pay is included within bonuses in the 
figures above. This increases our bonus gap 
as we tend to have a greater number of men 
in roles where performance related pay is a 
more significant proportion of total pay and 

more women employed in roles where pay is 
more consistent each month with a smaller 
variable element. In addition, our pay gap is 
increased due to the many part time roles we 
have across our business. These support those 
looking for flexible working arrangements but 
tend to be less senior positions and filled by 
women.
