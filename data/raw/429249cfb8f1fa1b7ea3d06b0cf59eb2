GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

 

Snapshot Date - 5 April 2017 

DATE OF REPORT 19th March 2018 

 

 

Marina Developments Limited (MDL) aims to provide equal opportunities to all employees. This includes ensuring all 
employees are rewarded and offered career development, irrespective of an employee’s gender.  

In accordance with the legislative requirement to publish Gender Pay Gap Data, the following statements and graphs 
outline MDL Marinas’ Gender Pay Gap results for 2017.  The figures and data shown are taken from the ‘snapshot date’ 5th 
April 2017. 

The graphs and commentary below show our results and these have been reached by using the mechanisms set out in the 
Gender Pay Gap reporting legislation guidelines. 

Key results highlighted are:- 

Gender Pay Gap 

  Both the mean and median measures show that average female pay is higher than pay to males. At the snapshot 

date the company had a number of females in senior positions, which has contributed to this outcome.  

Gender Bonus Gap  

 

 

The mean measure shows bonus  payments to females to be significantly  higher than to  males. This reflects the 
number of females in senior positions, who tend to earn higher bonuses. 
The median  measure tends to reduce the impact of the females in senior positions and as a result shows a 4% 
gap. 

 
Proportion of employees receiving a bonus 
 

 

This measure shows that 72% of females and 61% of males receive a bonus.  

 
Proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band  

  Most of our employees are employed at marina sites. These are occupations that tend to attract male workers and 
accordingly the data shows that in each quartile pay band the company has proportionately more male than female 
employees.  

I can confirm the data contained within this report for Marina Developments Limited is accurate, and has been produced in 
accordance with the ACAS Managing Gender Pay Reporting guidance.
