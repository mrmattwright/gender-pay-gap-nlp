Executive Summary: 
 
This  report  fulfils  the  Equality  Act  2017  Regulations  for  public  sector  organisations  with 
more  than  250  staff  to  publish  their  gender  pay  gap  and  bonus  gender  pay  gap  by  31st 
March 2018. The calculation is based on all staff including bank staff and on their net pay. 
The  bonus  gender  pay  gap  for  BDCFT  is  based  on  the  Consultant  Clinical  Excellence 
Awards. The mean Gender Pay Gap for BDCFT is 3.02%. The Bonus Gender Pay Gap is 
37.08%. Benchmarking information indicates that this gap is significantly lower than local 
NHS Trusts and the national figures.  
 
Further investigations need to be undertaken to understand the impact that salary sacrifice 
schemes  have  had  on 
there  are  
disproportionately fewer women applying for a Clinical Excellence Award. The data at this 
stage indicates that twice as many males are being awarded a CEA than females, despite 
the consultant staff group being split almost 50/50%. 
 
The Gender Pay Gap report provides compliance with the Equality Act 2017 Regulations. 
Activity  following  on  from  the  analysis  and  publication has  been  included  in  the  Equality, 
Diversity  and  Inclusion  Workforce  Strategy  2018  –  2021  approved  at  the  January  2018 
Trust Board.  
 
An  easy  read  infographic  with  the  key  data  on  is  included  in  Appendix  1  and  will  be 
published on the BDCFT website alongside this report in the Trust Board papers section. 
Recommendations: 
It is recommended that the Trust Board; 

the  gender  pay  gap  and 

the  reasons  why 

  Note  the  3.02%  Gender  Pay  Gap  and  37.8%  Bonus  Gender  Pay  Gap  and  the  initial 

analysis undertaken around those figures.  

  Note the benchmarking data and indication that BDCFT has a low Gender Pay gap; 

but that there still is a gap. 

  Approve the proposed activity set out in section 5 of this report. 
  Approve the infographic and this report for publication compliance. 
  Agree to receive an annual Gender Pay Gap report in February 2019 and progress 
on actions to address the pay gap as part of the Board six monthly update report on 
the new Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Workforce Strategy.

Gender Pay Gap Annual Report 

 
1.0 Background 
 
In  September  2017  new  Equality  Act  Regulations  were  published  that  required  public 
sector organisations to publish their gender pay gap by 31st March 2018. This requirement 
makes up one of the Equality Act’s 2010 Public Sector Equality Duties. Instruction on how 
to  undertake  the  calculation  was  issued  from  Central  Government  and  guidance 
developed for public sector bodies from ACAS1. In December 2017 an ESR module was 
launched that enabled Trusts to enter their data into a pre-built system that would calculate 
the Gender Pay Gap in a way that could be benchmarked across the NHS.  
 
The  Director  of  Human  Resources  and  Organisational  Development  has  been  working 
closely  with  other  Trusts  in  the  Region  via  the  Regional  HR  Directors  Network  to  share 
initial findings throughout the process so that they can be benchmarked. This report sets 
out  the  legally  required  Gender  Pay  Gap  and  the  actions  to  be  taken  to  understand  the 
information  further  and  address  the  outcome  of  that  investigation.  The  Gender  Pay  Gap 
needs to be published on the Bradford District Care Foundation Trust website. Publication 
of this report will fulfil that requirement.  
 
2.0 Compliance with the Requirements 
 
There is clear guidance on how to calculate the Gender Pay Gap. This is as follows:  
 
‘Gender  pay  reporting  legislation  requires  employers  with  250  or  more  employees  to 
publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their 
male and female employees. 

Reporting may show, for example, that on average men earn 9% more pay per hour than 
women, that men earn 5% more in bonuses per year than women, or that the lowest paid 
quarter  of  the  workforce  is  mostly  female. These  results  must  be  published  on  the 
employers  own website  and a government  site.  This  means  that  the  gender  pay gap will 
be publicly available, including to customers, employees and potential future recruits.  

As a result, employers should consider taking new or faster actions to reduce or eliminate 
their gender pay gaps. 

If you are an employer with 250 employees or more,  new legislation introduced this year 
means  you  will  need  to  publish  your  gender  pay  gap  data  annually.  From  April  2017 
employers  have  up  to  12  months  to  publish  this  information.  There  are  two  sets  of 
regulations.  Public  Sector  organisations  need  to  register  on  the  government's  online 
reporting  service  www.gov.uk/report-gender-pay-gap-data  to  upload  their  data  by  30th 
March 2018.2

2.1 Who counts as an employee?  
 
For the purposes of gender pay reporting, the definition of who counts as an employee is 
set out in the regulations and follows the definition in the Equality Act 2010. This is known 
as  an  ‘extended’  definition  which  includes;  employees  (those  with  a  contract  of 
employment),  workers  and  agency  workers  (those  with  a  contract  to  do  work  or  provide 
services),  some  self-employed people  (where  they  have  to personally  perform  the  work). 
This means that Bank Staff are included in the calculation if the Bank is run by the Public 
Sector organisation which it is in BDCFT’s case.  
 
It  is  important  to  recognise  that  the  gender  pay  gap  differs  to  equal  pay.  Equal  pay  is  in 
relation  to  pay  differences  between  men  and  women  who  carry  out  the  same  job  for 
different pay, which is unlawful. The gender pay gap shows the difference in average pay 
of all men and the average pay of all women. It is therefore possible to have genuine pay 
equality but still have a significant gender pay gap.  
 
2.2 Calculations Requirements 
 
An employer must publish six calculations showing their: 
 

1.  Average gender pay gap as a mean average. 
2.  Average gender pay gap as a median average. 
3.  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from lowest 

to highest pay. Within the NHS calculations these are referred to as ‘quartiles’. 
 

4.  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average. 
5.  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average. 
6.  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment and proportion of females receiving 
a  bonus  payment.  Within  BDCFT  NHS  calculations  this  is  made  up  of  Clinical 
Excellence Award payments. 

Employers  have  the  option  to  provide  a  narrative  with  their  calculations.  This  should 
generally explain the reasons for the results and give details about actions that are being 
taken  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  gender  pay  gap.  It  should  talk  about  the  challenges, 
successes and long term plans regarding the results. It is expected that the publication of 
these results will support and encourage action nationally.  

3.0 Gender Pay Gap Results 

The table below includes the BDCFT results. The calculations are based on the Electronic 
Staff Record data as at 31st March 2017 as instructed in the guidance.

Males  are  paid  an  average  of  £15  per  hour;  females  are  paid  an  average  of  £14.55  per 
hour.  The  monetary  pay  gap  is  0.45p  per  hour.  It  should  be  noted  when  reading  this 
information  that  salary  sacrifices  are  required  to  be  included  in  the  calculation.  Within 
BDCFT this includes staff that use the childcare voucher and the lease car scheme. The 
analysis is undertaken using the net pay received by staff as per the guidance.

Narrative  

In this calculation the hourly rates of pay are 
sorted from low to high, then grouped into 4 
quartiles,  so  the  4th  quartile  is  the  higher 
rates of pay. These figures show how many 
and  what  percentage  of  female  and  male 
staff  are  in  each  of  the  four  pay  quartiles. 
Across  the  whole  Trust  81.9%  of  staff  are 
female  and  18.1%  are  male. 
those 
females  were  distributed  evenly  across  the 
pay bands the percentage in each would be 
81.9% (reflective of that Trust average).  
 
This  shows  that  there  is  a  slight  under-
representation in the lower and higher bands 
and  a  higher  representation  in  the  middle 
bands.  
 

If 

Further  analysis  that  is  not  required  under  the  gender  pay  gap  regulations  shows  the 
percentage spread of male and female staff across the BDCFT bands.

Key points to note from this data are as follows: 

  A higher proportion of female staff are in the middle bands 4, 5 and 6.  
 

In  bands  8  and  9  the  proportion  that  are  women  is  significantly  lower  than  the 
Trustwide percentage of 81.9%. 

  The Executive and Dental Teams are more representative of the Trust wide 81.9% 

female figure.  
In medical staffing the percentage of male and female staff is almost equal, which is 
significantly different to the 81.9% female staffing figure across the Trust. 
In complete contrast to the staff figures 88.3% of Non-Executive Directors are male.

This  shows  that  women  are  more  likely  to  be  in  Dental,  qualified  nursing,  Scientific  and 
Technical roles and unqualified nursing roles than men. Males are significantly more likely 
to be in ancillary, managerial, senior managerial and medical roles.

Awards 

1.  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average. 
2.  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average. 

 
A  Clinical  Excellence  Award  is  available  to  consultants  who  have  at  least  one  years’ 
service  to  apply  for  annually.  Consultants  can  apply  every  year  until  they  reach  the 
maximum CEA threshold. To gain the award consultants need to be able to demonstrate 
that they have made a difference above and beyond their role to research, innovative ways 
of working or developing the service.

median average difference is -
53.84%. As mentioned above, 
the median is the middle 
number when the hourly rates 
are sorted from low to high; 
this indicates that whilst the 
average bonus pay is in favour 
of males, the median is in 
favour of females. This is likely 
to be due to the salary and 
bonus being included and the 
female staff length of service 
being longer. Further 
investigation on this is 
required.

This  information  needs  to  be  analysed  in  the  context  of  which  staff  groups  receive  the 
Clinical Excellence Award (CEA) and what percentage of those staff are male and female. 
Consultants are eligible for the CEA. To understand the picture more fully the current and 
previous  awards  have  been  broken  down  below.  There  are  58  consultants  in  the  Trust. 
47% are female and 53% are male.  

In 2017 during the reporting period 39 consultants were eligible to apply. 20 of those were 
female  and  19  were  male.  7  applications  were  received  2  were  from  women.  That  is  an 
under-representation  of  female  applicants.  This  is  an  issue  we  will  be  exploring  with 
female consultants. 

In 2018, so not in this reporting period, 35 consultants were eligible to apply for the Clinical 
Excellence Award.  19 of those were female and 16 were male.  It should be noted that in 
the  run  up  to  this  years’  CEA  to  address  the  disparity  identified  last  year  Positive  Action 
was used to encourage applications from women who were under-represented in previous 
years. Despite this 8 applications have been received and 3 of those are from women.  

4.0 Emerging National Benchmarking 

The Equality and Human Rights Commission has developed a Gender Pay Gap Calculator 
that  can  be  used  to  calculate  gender  pay  gaps  across  the  country  and  compare  results. 
This  will  develop  as  more  publications  are  made  using  the  calculation  guidance  but  it 
provides  a  guide  for  performance.  The  national  gender  pay  gap  is  £2.41,  £2.55  for 
England and £2.27 in Yorkshire, £2.13 in West Yorkshire and £1.66 in Bradford and 0.45p 
within the Trust.  

In addition regional NHS Trusts have agreed to anonymously share their data to support 
one  another  on  the  analysis.  The  mean  gender  pay  gaps  disclosed  range  from  between 
30% to 3%  

The  BDCFT  pay  gap  is  significantly  smaller  than  the  majority  of  Trusts.  In  these  initial 
stages  this  is  thought  to  be  because  of  the  higher  percentages  of  female  staff  in  higher 
banded clinically qualified roles within the Trust but this will be further analysed when the 
detail behind the figures is available.  

5.0 Proposed Activity to Address the Gender Pay Gap 

There are a number of pieces of further analysis that need to be carried out to understand 
the issues fully. These are: 

  To carry out further analysis to understand why fewer females are applying for the 

Clinical Excellence Awards and the composition of awarding panels. 

  Continue  to  promote  opportunities  for  flexible  working,  shared  parental  leave, 

career progression, promotion and leadership development opportunities  

  To ensure that in roles and bands where either gender is under-represented that is 
taken  into  consideration  in  recruitment  processes  and  where  appropriate  positive 
action is used in the same manner that it is used in relation to the Workforce Race 
Equality Standard  

  Publicise the data and work with local colleagues to further benchmark and develop 

action plans.  

 

8 

  The Equality and Diversity Workforce Strategy approved at the January 2018 Trust 
Board includes a focus on the outcome of the Gender Pay Gap work. The delivery 
of that action plan will ensue and fulfil the requirement to deliver on the outcome of 
these calculations. 

5.1 Legal and Constitutional 
 
The requirements to carry out this work are within the Equality Act 2010, 2017 Regulations 
public  sector  duties.  Publication  and  action  is  a  required  element  of  those  regulations. 
They have been adopted as one of the Trust’s nine Equality Objectives.  
 
5.2 Resource 
 
The work is led by the Human Resources and Organisational Development Directorate by 
the  Head  of  Equality  with  support  from  the  Workforce  Information  and  Recruitment  and 
Selection  Team.  The  next  phase  of  implementation  requires  further  analysis  from  these 
teams and networking with regional NHS Trusts.  
 
5.3 Quality and Compliance 
 
The Gender Pay Gap will be reported annually to the Trust Board and published following 
Board  approval.  The  data  and  action  plan  has  been  embedded  into  the  Trust’s  Equality 
and Diversity Workforce Strategy 2018 – 2021 progress against which will be reported at 
Board on a six monthly basis, and is one of the Trust’s nine Equality Objectives. Progress 
against the objectives is reported to the Quality and Safety Committee every six months. 
Equality  and  Diversity  is  also  a  discussion  item  on  the  service  Quality  and  Safety 
Governance Groups every six months and the data will be presented there for information 
and  action  if  appropriate.  The  data  is  uploaded  to  the  government  website  as  per  the 
compliance regulations annually.

7.  Communication and Involvement  
 
The requirements to publicise the gender pay gap on the website and to upload the data to 
the government website will be fulfilled by 31st March 2018. The findings will be publicised 
throughout the Trust via e-update and staff will be able to access the report via Connect 
the  BDCFT  intranet  site  pages.  The  Head  of  Equality  has  been  liaising  with  the  regional 
NHS Equality Leads at the Regional Equality Network about the calculation process. The 
Director of HR and OD has been linking closely  with local NHS Trusts to benchmark the 
data. The data and activity planned will be shared as part of the Equality Delivery System

(2) performance analysis process annually. Provisional data was shared in the December 
panel and the Trust’s self-assessment for performance was assessed as green. Panel and 
community  members  are  currently  being  asked  to  comment  on  that  self-assessed  grade 
via an e-survey. The Gender Pay Gap and Bonus Gender Pay Gap will be benchmarked 
once  the  data  has  been  publicised  with  other  NHS  Provider  Trusts  at  the  Equality  and 
Diversity Regional Network.  
 
8.  Monitoring and review 
 
The ongoing monitoring of this work happens through the bi-annual EDS (2) update at the 
Quality and Safety Committee. An annual review of progress will come to Trust Board in 
February  2019  along  with  the  gender  pay  gap  figures  for  the  preceding  12  months.  The 
actions  identified and their impact will be monitored as part of  the Equality, Diversity and 
Inclusion Workforce Strategy review at the Workforce Transformation Steering Group with
