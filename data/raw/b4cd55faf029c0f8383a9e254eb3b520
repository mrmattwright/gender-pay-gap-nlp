Submitted by alanO on Wed, 03/14/2018 - 13:29    AGENCY 2000 LIMITED  We trade as MEM Recruitment from three local offices and more than 95% of our people work for Clients in the surrounding areas as Temporary workers. A company of our size is required to publish data on the gender pay gap of our payroll. This gives an indication both to us and to the wider community of how fair we are in paying male and female staff and to guide us on areas where we may improve this.  We are very pleased to highlight that the gender pay gap, based upon median hourly rates, is zero, meaning that for the company as a whole, there is no systemic difference in pay between males and females.  Our principal area of concern, although it affects only a very few staff in total, is to encourage more females on our permanent payroll into the Client-facing roles that would offer them performance bonuses. We have started action to address this concern in 2018.
