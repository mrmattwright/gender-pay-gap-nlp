Download our remuneration policy    Spurgeons Gender Pay Gap on 5 April 2017  In 2017 the Government introduced a requirement that every organisation employing 250+ people must report a set of key data around gender and pay.  The calculation is based on a snapshot taken of the organisation, in the case of charities this is 5 April each year. The results presented use the Government prescribed methodology and as a result could be misunderstood. Therefore, this report highlights some aspects of Spurgeons and the methodology used that should be taken into consideration when reading the results we are asked to report.  Spurgeons has a clear pay and remuneration policy that seeks to live out our values of compassion, inclusiveness and hope, recognising our staff as central to us living out our mission and realising our vision.

Checking the gift aid box as you donate boosts your donation by 25p for every £1 you give. Gift Aid is reclaimed by Spurgeons from the tax you pay for the current tax year.  Using Gift Aid means that for every pound you give, we get an extra 25 pence from the Inland Revenue, helping your donation go further. This means that £100 can be turned into £125 just so long as donations are made through Gift Aid.  When you check the gift aid box we update your information automatically to ensure that future gifts are gift aided too.  You are eligible to check the gift aid box if you are a UK taxpayer but please be aware that if you pay less Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax than the amount of Gift Aid claimed on donations made in a tax year it is your responsibility to pay any difference.  If you pay Income Tax at a higher or additional rate and want to receive the additional tax relief due to you, you must include all your Gift Aid donations on your Self-Assessment tax return or ask HM Revenue and Customs to adjust your tax code.
