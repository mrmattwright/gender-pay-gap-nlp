Gender Pay Gap reporting is not to be confused with Equal Pay; as an organisation  KSS CRC has always been committed to ensuring they do not pay men and women differently for doing the same or equivalent work.   The Gender Pay Gap is as a result of the roles which men and women are employed in and the salaries these roles attract.  Our report illustrates a mean gender pay gap of 0.76% and a median gap of 1.97%.  These figures are representative of an employee base where 25.7% are male and 74.3% are female.   Our figures are significantly lower than the national average and the gender pay gap is negligible.  Principally this is due to having set pay scales and salary bands for all roles within the business.
