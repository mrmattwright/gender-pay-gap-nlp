We, the Borough Council, have a long standing commitment to equalities, having first adopted an Equality Policy in the early 1990’s. Since then our policies and procedures have evolved in line with legislative changes to ensure we continue to comply with the equalities legislation and recommended practice.  We're committed to equality of opportunity for residents, visitors and employees. And we will take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure we comply with equalities legislation.  We also recognise that we have a role in promoting equality of opportunity and challenging discrimination. Our role as a community leader, service provider and employer places us in a unique position to:   work actively towards eliminating unlawful discrimination  help ensure residents and employees maximise their contribution within west Norfolk   Through our Equality Policy we've set out how we seek to ensure equality for all of our residents, visitors and our employees. We aim to do this through:   the delivery of accessible and fair services  treating our employees and service users with fairness and respect  ensuring all contractors and other third party organisations we work with share our commitment to equalities   View our Equality Policy  What is the Public Sector Equality Duty?  The Equality Act 2010 introduces the ‘public sector equality duty’, which is made up of a general duty supported by specific duties. The ‘general equality duty’ is the overarching requirement or substance of the duty. And the ‘specific duties’ are intended to help performance on the general equality duty.  The general equality duty requires public authorities, in the exercise of their functions, to have due regard to the need to:   eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation or any other conduct prohibited by the act in relation to the protected characteristics  advance equality of opportunity between all persons; and  foster good relations between groups of people sharing a protected characteristic and those that do not   What are our specific duties in relation to the Equality Act 2010?  In addition to complying with the ‘general equality duty’, the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations came into force in September 2011. These require public bodies to:   publish information to demonstrate their compliance with the general equality duty; this information must be published by 31 January 2012  set specific, measurable equality objectives by 6 April 2012   The information published must include information relating to people who share a relevant protected characteristic who are:   it's employees  people affected by its policies and practices (for example, service users)   What equality information must we publish about our employees?  We're required to publish a range of information in relation to employees. Our aims regarding equalities in employment are outlined in appendix A of the Equality Policy.  Monitoring of a range of employment functions is undertaken annually. The results from this are published in the Annual Employment Monitoring Report.  We also have a policy statement on Harassment at Work. This states that all employees have a right to be treated with dignity and respect. It outlines the steps we will take to ensure this right is protected.  What equality information must we publish about our services?  We publish a wide range of key information on performance, service provision, decisions made and the population we serve. This is used to inform decisions about policies and services.  What are our equality objectives?  A number of equality objectives have been developed to support our corporate business plan . The business plan defines our priorities for the next four years.

What are our employment policies in relation to equalities?  We, as a major employer in west Norfolk, wholeheartedly support the principle of equal opportunity in employment. And we oppose all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination. The employment related sections of this policy therefore concern all matters directly or indirectly related to employment affecting individuals or groups whether they are actual or potential employees.
