MOO: 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report
At MOO, we treat all employees fairly and equally. We work hard to create 
a values-driven, purposeful and highly empowered organisation that we are all 
proud to work for.
 
This report provides an overview of MOO’s Gender Pay Gap ﬁgures, which we are 
submitting in line with the UK Government’s Gender Pay Gap reporting legislation. 
MOO is an international design, technology and manufacturing business where 
53% of our employees are women (237 out of 451) and 46% of our employees 
(207 out of 451) are based outside the UK. So, in this report we have included 
a global picture of our business, as well as that of the UK.

What is the gender pay gap?

The Gender Pay Gap refers to the percentage difference between women and 
men’s average hourly earnings across all employee roles within a business. 
In addition, it is measured in four quartiles with an equal number of employees 
in each quartile according to their pay. The Gender Pay Gap does not take into 
account the fact that there are different levels of seniority within a business. 
It is different to Equal Pay, which examines whether women and men are given 
equal pay for carrying out the same work. We are committed to equality and 
regularly review our pay levels to ensure that men and women are paid equally 
for performing equivalent roles.

Our UK gender pay gap – Salaries

In the UK, we are underperforming against the average 
by 5.1% points with a mean percentage gap of 23.2%. 
This is due to two main factors:

 
We have a lower proportion of women in the top quartiles (38% to 62%) 
due to a lower percentage of women in technology roles  (21% to 79%)

We have a higher proportion of women in the lower quartiles, speciﬁcally 
in some manufacturing roles (91% to 9%) and customer service roles 
(73% to 27%)

Founder and CEO comment on our results

As the founder of MOO having a diverse team in which everyone is treated fairly 
is incredibly important to me.
 
MOO is a global business. The Gender Pay Gap process has been enlightening 
as we have never looked at this locally and with such scrutiny. Our UK ﬁgures 
have helped us reﬂect on where we fall short and have created vitally important 
conversations around the business.
 
At MOO we’re trying to build a company that reﬂects the world around us. As 
a result of this process, we now have some meaningful actions which we intend 
to implement to ensure we have a business that better represents society.
 
We will continue in our efforts to create a diverse, inclusive and friendly 
environment. I am committed to building a company in which everyone can 
succeed. We know how much different backgrounds and perspectives make 
for a better workplace, a stronger company and a better experience for the 
customers and the communities we serve.

CEO
