Employers in Great Britain with more than 250 staff are required by law to publish data on:   Gender pay gap (mean and median averages)  Gender bonus gap (mean and median averages)  Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses  Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure   On the required ‘snapshot’ reporting date in April 2017, RIBA did not employ more than 250 staff.   RIBA data:   Women’s hourly rate of pay is 14.61% lower (mean), 4.05% lower (median).  No bonuses were paid.  Quartile gender breakdown:      Male  Female     Upper quartile   49.15%  50.85%     Upper middle quartile   28.81%  71.19%     Lower middle quartile   38.98%  61.02%     Lower quartile   30.51%  69.49%     RIBA Chief Executive Alan Vallance said:  “This data provides an important initial benchmark for us to track progress over the next few years. Whilst our results are favourable in comparison to the national average and many other similar organisations, we recognise that there is room for improvement.  Overall our staff are predominantly female (63%) but our senior roles are currently overrepresented by men and this is impacting on our gender pay data.  Whilst we are not expecting significant changes to our gender pay results in the short term we are working to address the issues. We have recently invested significantly in our technology to support more flexible working arrangements; currently 21% of our staff work part time. We are committed to ensuring our advertising and recruitment processes encourage diversity, particularly with regard to our more senior roles, and are evolving our approach to career development.”  RIBA President Ben Derbyshire said:  “I am proud to represent an organisation that is leading by example, by voluntarily sharing its gender pay data and analysis. I encourage practices with fewer than 250 staff to follow suit, and publish their data.  The RIBA executive and trustees are focused on ensuring our Institute is in the best possible shape to give our members the support they need to succeed now and in the future – diverse and talented staff are absolutely key to achieving this.”  ENDS  Notes to editors:  1.
