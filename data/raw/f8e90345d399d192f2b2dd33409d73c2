This is the first step towards creating more transparency on the pay area regarding gender differentials and it will encourage organisations to identify the causes and put into action the steps to rectify their gender pay gaps.  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the average earnings of men and women across the organisation. It is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay relates to men and women being paid equally for equal work and is a legal requirement in the UK.  In line with the reporting requirements, our results are for Ed Broking LLP as at 5 April 2017.
