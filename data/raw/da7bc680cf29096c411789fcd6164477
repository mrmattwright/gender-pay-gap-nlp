Our Results

At JD Williams & Company Ltd we want to make sure that every colleague is treated with fairness, dignity and respect and
has access to the same rewards and opportunities. Everything we achieve as a business, we achieve through our people.
  
The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between men and women’s average hourly earnings. The Office of National
Statistics has reported that the overall UK gender pay gap is currently 18%.
  
This  is  not  neccessarily  an  indication  of  gender  discrimination.  The  data  measures  the  difference  between  the  average
earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of their role or seniority. It is distinct from equal pay, which is about
ensuring that men and women are paid the same for carrying out work of equal value.
  
Our gap of 6% is substantially better than the national average of 18% and the retail sector which is even higher than this.
However, we are well aware that there still work to be done, particularly in keeping the pipeline open for women to progress
to top roles. We continue to care about diversity and addressing the gender pay gap, however small, within our organisation.
  
The UK government has introduced a requirement for all employers with more than 250 employees to publish their gender
pay gap figures. The regulations require us to publish six key differences in pay between male and female colleagues. Our
results can be seen below along with our demographics (as at April 2017).

OUR DEMOGRAPHICS

ALL GROUP EMPLOYEES

MALE : 40% (1042)

FEMALE : 60% (1536)

PART TIME EMPLOYEES

MALE : 18% (87)

FEMALE : 82% (387)

Overall, we are pleased to report that 60% of
our  JD  Williams  &  Company  Ltd  employees
in England, Wales & Scotland are female, or
1536  out  of  2575  (as  of  April  2017).  This
increases  to  82%  if  we  look  at  part  time
employees only (387 out of 474).
  
We  are  confident 
that  women  are  well
represented at all levels of the business. This
includes  our  operational  board.  At  38%,
women are better represented at board level
than  89%  of  the  rest  of  the  FTSE250,

MEDIAN GENDER PAY GAP

The  first  two  requirements  cover  the  percentage  gap  in  men
and  women's  hourly  rates  of  pay,  mean  (average)  &  median
(middle) in April 2017.

JD  Williams  &  Company  ltd  has  a  mean  gender  pay  gap  of
6%, considerably lower than the national average of 18%. Our
median  pay  gap  is  7%  in  favour  of  women.  The  mean  is
skewed  in  favour  of  men  by  slightly  lower  levels  of  female
representation at a senior level.

The next three requirements cover bonus pay received
over  the  12  months  up  to  April  2017.  The  mean  &
median bonus gaps are reported as with the pay gap, as
well as the proportion of men and women that received
a bonus.

The proportion of men and women receiving a bonus is
fairly  equal  at  88%  &  83%  respectively.  However,  our
mean bonus gap is 33% and the median is 26%.

MEDIAN GENDER BONUS GAP

26%

Our bonus data is materially affected by a £30 ex-gratia
payment made as a gesture of goodwill to around 2000
colleagues.

Whilst this increased the amount of women that received
a  bonus,  the  average  bonus  received  by  women  was
lowered  as  a  result  of  a  higher  proportion  of  women
within  this  group  of  employees.  If  we  discount  this
payment, the median bonus gap would be zero and the
mean gap is 12% in favour of men.

CEO COMMENT ON THE RESULTS

and 

showing 

The  last  requirement  looks  at
our  pay  quartiles.  We  do  this
by  splitting  employees 
into
four  groups  based  on  their
pay, 
the
proportion of men and women
in each group.
  Our 
align
approximately  to  where  you’d
expect  them  to  be,  based  on
our 60/40 demographic split.

quartiles 

pay 

We are proud that the results of our analysis place us in a strong position. Diversity and inclusivity influences our policies
and  culture  at  all  levels  and  this  is  reflected  is  our  balanced  quartiles  and  pay  gaps  much  lower  than  the  national
average.
  
In  November  2017  the  Hampton-Alexander  Review  placed  us  as  the  second  best  FTSE250  performer  for  women’s
representation  on  the  Combined  Executive  Committee  and  Direct  Reports.  With  47%  women  either  on  the  board  or
directly reporting to the board, we significantly exceeded the 33% target along with only 40 other companies. We are
also ahead of the target for female board representation.
  
Our  bonus  gap  was  higher  than  we  anticipated,  but  further  analysis  showed  that  this  was  no  cause  for  concern.  As
discussed above, an ex-gratia payment was made as a goodwill gesture to employees that would not otherwise have
received a bonus. When we adjust for this factor the median bonus gap drops to 0% and the mean bonus gap is 12% in
favour of men.
  
We would like to build on our success in addressing diversity. We have already implemented our Women in Leadership
programme which provides our top talent with access to executive leadership development. In addition, our ‘Women Like
Us’ campaign aims to provide role models and mentors to increase opportunities for women to progress. We are also
developing a number of initiatives to further reduce the pay gap, including blind CV sifting, equal pay review analysis and
assessing our flexible/agile working, maternity and paternity policies for all of our employees.
  
We will continue to monitor the representation of women within senior roles and plan progression so that we do not miss
out on female talent.

The Gender Pay Information Regulations require us to report the results of JD Williams & Co ltd separately from our
group results. The N Brown Group plc results have been published separately and include the gender pay information
for 2575 employees of JD Williams & Co Ltd and the 3 employees of N Brown Group plc , we believe this to be a more
accurate respresentation of our business. 

I confirm that the data published in this report is accurate.
