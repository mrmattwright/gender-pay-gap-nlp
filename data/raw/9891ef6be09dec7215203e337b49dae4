CHEVRON ARE DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT THIS EXCELLENT INITIATIVE AND PRESENT BELOW OUR GENDER PAY GAP DATA COVERING STAFF EMPLOYED AS AT 5TH APRIL 2017.  The regulations require us to carry out six calculations that show the difference (“the gender pay gap”) between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation, regardless of the nature of their work. The gender pay gap is not the same as an equal pay comparison, which deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs, or work of equal value.  The table below shows the relevant calculations for Chevron, covering staff employed at 5 April 2017:      Measure  2017 Calculation  2017 Calculation    Difference in mean hourly rate of pay  -11.5%      Difference in median hourly rate of pay  -33.2%      Difference in mean bonus pay  38.4%      Difference in median bonus pay  58.3%      Percentage of employees who received bonus pay  Male 12%  Female 68%    Employees by Pay Quartile:  Male  Female    Upper quartile  89%  11%    Upper middle quartile  95%  5%    Lower middle quartile  97%  3%    Lower quartile  98%  2%       WRITTEN STATEMENT FROM CHEVRON’S FINANCE DIRECTOR:  I am pleased to confirm our 2017 published gender pay gap information as presented above. By way of context, our staff consists mainly of shift-paid traffic management workers who, at the snapshot date, are overwhelmingly male, whereas our female colleagues, again at the snapshot date, tended to hold salaried administrative or managerial roles within the organisation. It is this that accounts for the negative gender pay gap data recorded in mean and median hourly rates of pay. For example, a minus 11.5% difference in mean hourly rate of pay means that the mean hourly rate of pay for female Chevron employees was 11.5% higher than the mean hourly rate of pay for male Chevron employees on the snapshot date. We note the differences in mean and median bonus pay, which is due to fewer women working in the more senior roles that qualify for larger bonus payments. The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to work towards narrowing or eliminating that gap.  Anthony Livingstone - Finance Director 3rd April 2018                              M60/A5103 Princess Parkway, Yew Tree Foot Bridge   Thank you for your help. The works to the bridge were completed and great teamwork from both crews. I had a good view from the bridge and was very impressed by their work. Always said it....TM is an art form!​  Karl Sandiford, Supervisor- Balfour Beatty Mott MacDonald         M40 J1-1a Lighting   Please accept our thanks your team’s efforts on this project.  Chevron have been brilliant, nothing has been too much to ask of you and we have delivered to programme despite the complexities of working at these junctions. Look forward to working with you in the future, I think it’s forged a good relationship between us.  Stuart Wager, Senior Engineer, Skanska         Marlow Carnival 2017   Can I please express my thanks on behalf of everyone at Kier for the exceptional aptitude and attitude shown by one of your site teams who were engaged in a recent local community project. On Saturday 16th September, Ashlea Wright-Rivers , Tony Westgarth, Matt Sawyer, James Taylor  & Jamie Phillip joined myself in Marlow, Bucks to provide a closure of the main road to enable the Marlow carnival procession of nearly 300 school children to take place. There was a large element of pre-setting and customer liaison involved in this day time closure and not only did the crew, vehicles and equipment look immaculate the real show stopper was the can do attitude and professionalism shown by your crew. As with any town centre closure there were some ‘challenges’ thrown at the crew but their attitude and commitment to the safety of the children, parents and support groups was second to none. It’s lovely to be able to write this reference to your colleagues, please pass on my most sincere thanks.  Richard Moore, Traffic Management Team Manager, Kier Highways         Area 3 ASC- Emergency Narrow Lane Scheme, M27 J12   Another great success for Area 3. To turn this around in such a short space of time due to the nature of the repair and the location is a credit to you and your teams. Well done!​  Gary Stockwell MCIHT, Area 3 Asset Delivery Manager, Kier Highways         A404 Resurfacing   Could I say a big thank you to yourselves and to all your crews which were on site at the A404 Resurfacing scheme last night. I have spoken to the Tarmac site supervisor from the Chieveley depot this morning who was very appreciative of how helpful and how good it was to work with the crew that was on site.
