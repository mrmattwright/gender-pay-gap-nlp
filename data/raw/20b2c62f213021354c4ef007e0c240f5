Foreword 

The Lead Employer Trust (LET) is an NHS trust that employs junior doctors, dentists and GP trainees 
within the North East of England (with the exception of Foundation Trainees).  The LET is committed 
to the principles of equality of opportunity in employment and believes that staff should receive 
equal pay for the same or broadly similar work or work related as equivalent and for work of equal 
pay.  This will apply regardless of an employees: 

  Race 
  Disability 
  Age 
  Sex (male or Female) 
  Sexual orientation 
  Gender Reassignment 
  Pregnancy and maternity 
  Marriage and civil partnership 
  Religion or belief 

The LET recognises that in order to achieve equal pay, it should operate systems which are 
transparent, based on objective criteria and free from unlawful bias. 

All LET employees are paid using the national pay scales provided by NHS Employers.  The pay scale 
that the LET employees are paid on is relative to the date of their commencement. Those who 
commenced prior to 3 August 2016 are paid using the payscale’s relevant to 2002 Medical & Dental 
Terms and Conditions of Service, based on the level of training. Those who commenced on or after 3 
August 2016 are paid using the payscale’s relevant to 2016 Medical & Dental Terms and Conditions 
of Service based on previous verified service.  

The LET is committed to: 

Informing employees how pay regulations operate and how their own pay is calculated 

 
  Undertake regular monitoring of impact of our practices in line with the requirements of the 

Equality Act 2010 

  Follow up promptly any concerns raised by staff or their representative organisations about 

pay or terms and conditions. 

The LET Gender pay gap report suggests that we have a very minimal mean gender pay gap, 
however this could be down to many other factors. 

It suggests that male trainees are paid on average £1.2689 per hour more than female trainees, this 
gives 4.73% gender pay gap. It also suggests that using the median calculation male trainees are paid 
£1.1262 per hour more that female trainees, this gives 4.31% gender pay gap.
