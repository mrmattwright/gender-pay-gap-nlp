We work closely with many leading companies, many of whom are represented on our Expert Advisory Board. Many more choose to send their Apprentices to us for the quality of our teaching. We offer Apprenticeships in more than 50 areas, and a wide range of flexibly delivered Business & Professional courses.  These links mean we understand what employers want, like Applied Generals, combining academic with more practical-based learning so students have the right skill-sets to stand them in good stead for entering the jobs market.  That's why we're offering Level 3 OCR Cambridge Technicals in Engineering.The qualification has been specially designed for learners aged 16-19 wanting to gain thorough knowledge, understanding and competencies for the engineering sector. Assessed by a combination of written exams and assignments, they attract UCAS points for university entry.  In 2015, we were instrumental in bringing TeenTech to Portsmouth for the first time as headline sponsors. Launched by ex-Tomorrow's World presenter Maggie Philbin, it's all about changing the perceptions of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) careers among pupils and their teachers, as well as acting as a catalyst to encourage businesses to engage with young people.  The 220 Year 8 and 9 pupils had a great time taking part in various activities across 3 zones: Innovation, Insight and Challenge. Among the many exciting opportunities, they got to drive robots with the National Grid, fire projectiles with Royal Armouries, work on a cosmetics production line with Laleham Health and Beauty, carry out surgery with Portsmouth Hospitals and work in a TV studio with the Highbury team.  It was so successful we're doing it all over again in 2016 - and this time it will be even bigger and better!  At the same time, we support your business and professional needs with a wide range of flexibly delivered courses. Our training ranges from short courses in presentation skills, HR and customer service, through to management Diplomas, work-based apprenticeships and NVQs. PLUS, we're one of the leading providers in the area for accountancy, bookkeeping and payroll qualifications.
