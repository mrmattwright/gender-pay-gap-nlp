At Estuary, as at April 2017, the average difference in pay was 20.2% between men and women, which means the average salary for men is 20.2% higher than the average salary for women. Our full Gender Pay Gap report [pdf] 309KB is available now.  Why is th ere a Gap ?  Simply because our services span a wide range e.g. care and support, repairs and maintenance, new homes development and central services (such as IT, Finance and HR). In each of these areas the skills required and the market rate for pay is very different. We have more women than men in front-line care and support and nursery services, where salaries are often lower due to external market factors, such as the contract price set by commissioners of our services (mainly local authority and health partners). Further analysis of the data shows no underlying concerns for Estuary other than the disproportionate amount of women within our care and support and nursery services. Women make up 62% of our upper quartile roles and 71% of our upper middle quartile roles (the Senior Management Team of 9 roles is made up of 4 women and 5 men and there are a large number of women in middle manager and specialist professional roles).  How does this affect Equal Pay at Estuary?  The Gender Pay Gap difference is not the same as equal pay.  It reflects how women and men are spread throughout the organisation. It does not indicate that men and women doing the same work are paid differently – it shows us that a bigger proportion of women are in lower paid roles. Estuary annually reviews all salaries and ensures that men and women undertaking the same role receive the same hourly rate for the job.  What is Estuary’s workforce split?  As of April 2017, our workforce comprised 73% females and 27% males.  What is the plan for addressing Gender Pay Gaps in the future?  Estuary is committed to ensuring we continue to annually review our salaries and undertake equal pay audits and, going forward, to closing the Gender Pay Gap that exists in our workforce where possible. We have a range of policies to facilitate flexible working (such as Enhanced Maternity Pay, Shared Parental Leave, Paternity Leave, Carers Leave, Flexible Working policy) and staff benefits (such as childcare voucher scheme, paid sick leave and carers leave, career breaks) to assist those with caring responsibilities. Our Training and Development opportunities (including sponsored qualification routes) are not gender specific and are tailored to individual requirements.  We plan to:   Work towards increasing the lower paid roles in incremental stages to the National Living Wage by 2020  Continue to develop options for recruitment to include more diversity, flexibility and gender neutrality – encouraging more males into current female dominate service areas where this is possible  Monitor recruitment specifically for inclusivity and gender bias – whilst ensuring that we recruit the best person for the job at all times  Monitor Exceptional Performance Awards for inclusivity and gender bias              Back to top of page  Print this page  Email this page  Site map              About Us  submenu       How We Use Your Infomation      Senior Management Structure      Contact Us      Governance Structure      Equality and Diversity      Gender Pay Gap Report       Equality and Diversity Impact Assessments        Service Standards      Annual Report and Financial Statement      Media Centre      Have Your Say      Procurement      Our History      Mission Statement Values and Aims      Value For Money - VFM      Working For Estuary      Green Zone      Room Hire      Safeguarding      Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement             Quicklinks          Pay My Rent         Report Anti-Social Behaviour         Have Your Say         Finding a Home         My Estuary         Current Vacancies         Contact Us                    Estuary
