We want every member of our staff to feel welcome, valued and confident they'll achieve their career objectives here.  It's the minimum our employees should expect of us - and it's good for business, too. An environment that cares for its people fosters innovation, creativity and excellent client relationships. We want the composition of our firm to reflect that of society. To achieve this, we've put a range of measures in place.  Internally, our Inclusion and Diversity steering group champions relevant activities across all our offices. We've set up staff networks such as the Female Insurance Group (FIG), lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) and Working Parents and Carers. We also provide development programmes for people at key transition points in their careers.  Externally, we've established collaborative partnerships with the 30% Club, Business in the Community, Stonewall, InterLaw and University of Law.
