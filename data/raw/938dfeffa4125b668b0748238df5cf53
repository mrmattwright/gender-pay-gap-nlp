gender pay gap report 

Reporting on data collected in the 12 months prior to 5th April 2017

As a business we are pleased to report that our Mean 
Gender Pay Gap of 12.59% sits noticeably below the 
most recently published average figure in the UK 
of 18.4%. However, it still highlights a gap between 
the pay of men and women which our Leadership 
Team are passionate about understanding better and 
addressing if any inequalities are found. 

We are proud that 63% of our UK based Leadership 
Team members are female and that 41% of the jobs 
which are in our upper quartile for pay are held by 
women. 

As a business we strive to ensure all jobs are  
right-sized and are able to be delivered within  

normal working hours; therefore allowing 
all employees to balance work with other 
responsibilities and interests.

In the past year our Sales and Research teams, 
who account for 69% of our UK workforce, have 
introduced internal job levels as part of their new 
Career Path Models. These levels ensure equal basic 
pay for people performing the same or equivalent 
work within a function.

All new hires and internal promotions are already 
using these new pay bands.

EUROMONITOR INTERNATIONAL GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

In our next annual pay review, which takes place 
in April 2018, our Management Team will be 
including an assessment of where the basic pay 
of each employee sits against others performing 
the same, or similar roles. Any variances will 
form part of the discussion on the appropriate 
pay award for an individual. 

We are confident that this process will ensure 
pay gaps will not be able to stem from paying 
men and women performing the same role 
differently.

EUROMONITOR INTERNATIONAL GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

Looking forward

Whilst our mean gender pay gap sits favourably 
with national statistics, we acknowledge that 
there is more to do in order to identify the reasons 
behind the differences in our pay between genders. 
Steps we will be taking this year include:

•  Reviewing the number of males and females 

being promoted within the business 

•  Using our annual salary review process to 

identify those currently paid at the extremes 
of the salary range for each level in the Career 
Path, and addressing any inequalities through 
our annual pay review process

•  Building a gender report into our annual pay 
review process to identify the proportion of 
each gender receiving the highest level of pay 
increase
