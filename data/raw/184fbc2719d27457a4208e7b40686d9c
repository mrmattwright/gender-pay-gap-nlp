STATUTORY GENDER 
PAY GAP 2017 REPORT

INTRODUCTION

Here at Salford City College, we are committed to improving equality for staff and students and increasing 
our diversity as an institution. The challenge in our organisation and across the Country is to eliminate any 
gender pay gap.

The College, as all organisations with over 250 staff in England & Wales are, is required to publish Gender 
Pay Gap data by 31st March 2018. This report is an important step in understanding the factors influencing 
our pay gap in more detail and developing on our action plan designed to address them. The College is not 
viewing this exercise as a matter of compliance but as an important development in our understanding of the 
barriers to equality within the organisation.

We can use the results to assess:

• The levels of gender equality in our workplace

• The balance of male and female employees at different levels

• How effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.

At March 2017 our mean gender pay gap was 10.8% and our median gender pay gap was 30.6%, both in 
favour of men. Whilst our mean gender pay gap is lower than the national average, it is important that we 
continue taking steps to narrow both gaps.

The data set for the next analysis will be taken as at March 31st 2018 to be analysed and published by March 
2019. 

With best wishes

ABOUT SALFORD 
CITY COLLEGE

In March 2017, the College employed 697 full pay relevant employees, of which 442 (63.4%) were Female, and
255 (36.6%) were Male. These staff were engaged in a wide range of activities and are categorised as either 
support (58.5%) or teaching staff (41.5%). 46.6% of employees work full time, of which 51.4% are female. 372 
employees work part time, term time only or casually, 73.9% of which are female.

Teaching staff at the College are paid in accordance with the Conditions of Service Handbook for Staff in 
Sixth Form Colleges and other staff are paid in accordance with the Sixth Form College Association’s terms 
and conditions for support staff.

GENDER PAY REPORTING IS DIFFERENT TO EQUAL PAY

Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar 
jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The 
College uses robust processes including job evaluation to ensure that we are an equal pay employer.

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in a workforce. If a 
workforce has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may a number of issues to deal with, 
and the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are.

GENDER PAY CALCULATIONS

The Statutory Pay Gap calculation includes all full time relevant employees in March 2017, after Salary
Sacrifice deductions have been made. The Gender Pay Gap is defined as the difference between the mean
and median hourly rate of pay that male and female employees received in March 2017. The Mean Pay Gap is 
the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women. The Median Pay Gap is the difference 
between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly earnings of men and women.

WHY DO WE HAVE 
A GENDER PAY 
GAP?

•  Our mean gender pay gap is 10.8% which is below the UK National Average of 17.4% and our median 

gender pay gap is 30.6% which is above the UK National Average of 18.4%.

•  On analysis, the majority of our staff are female, 63.4%, and 36.6% are male. Moreover the majority of our 

female staff are on support contracts, 63.1%. The analysis shows that we employ more females in lower 
paid support roles, which traditionally attract more women. This results in a mean pay gap, but a more 
significant median pay gap. 

• 

For the quartile splits, the ideal would be to see a female / male split close to that of the whole 
organisation, 63.4% female and 36.6% male. Our figures show that we have higher numbers of women in 
lower paid roles with 69.1% of women being paid in the bottom quartile. Our percentage of female staff 
decreases as you go up the quartiles, yet the percentage of male staff increases as you go up the quartiles.  
At the census point for this report, the percentage of males employed at the top quartile (43.7%) was 
higher than the overall percentage of males for the organisation (36.6%).

•  Three salary sacrifice schemes are currently available at the College. Under the regulations we are 

required to exclude salary sacrifice sums from the gross pay of participating staff for the purposes of 
this gender pay gap reporting. With 43 staff (62.8% female at the time of reference) participating in our 
Childcare Vouchers Scheme, another 7 staff participating in our Ride to Work Scheme and a further 48 
participating in the MyTech Scheme, this effectively reduces their hourly rate although they benefit from 
the tax exemption while still receiving the ‘value’ of that pay.  This needs to be carefully considered in the 
analysis of our pay gap data.

• 

Support staff are eligible for an annual bonus (SSSP) and Work Based Learning support staff are also 
eligible for a further bonus. Given that we employ more women, and that more of those women are 
employed on a support contract, it is not a surprise that 34.2% of females receive a bonus as opposed to 
only 21.2%.The mean bonus pay gap of 13.7% and median bonus pay gap of 5.4% both in favour of men, 
is attributable to the fact that the SSSP bonus is paid pro-rata to hours and weeks worked, and more 
women who received a bonus were part time (74.8%) than men (38.9%) who received a bonus.

PLANS TO 
ADDRESS THE 
GENDER PAY GAP

The College is committed to addressing the Gender Pay Gap and will ensure that gender equality is a core 
part of our Single Equality Scheme.The College’s Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Steering group will be agreeing 
specific actions which may include:

•  A review of our recruitment processes to ensure that we are addressing gender under-representation 
across the College, and look to ensure that all interviewers have undergone unconscious bias training.

•  A review of our PDR processes and CPD strategy to support all staff, but look specifically at 

opportunities for women to progress their careers within the College through talent management and 
on-going personal development.

•  We will continue to encourage flexible working across the college in every role and at every level 
to ensure that our people have the opportunity to work in a way that works best for their career 
aspirations, College needs and home life.

•  We will undertake an early analysis of our Gender Pay Data as at 31st March 2018, to ensure that this 

information feeds into our actions for this year as opposed to waiting until the March 2019 deadline for 
data publishing.

APPENDIX 1: 
CALCULATING THE 
GENDER PAY GAP

The Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 sets out the requirements 
of the College to annually publish its Gender Pay Gap based on a March snapshot date. This is calculated as 
follows:

•  The pay gap is calculated as a percentage of the difference between the average gross hourly pay of male 

employees compared to female employees.

• 

 An employee is defined as a person who is employed by the College, is a worker contracted to provide 
a service, or a self-employed person contracted directly to provide a service. Workers employed through 
agencies, or self-employed workers paid via a company are excluded from the calculation.

•  The Hourly Pay Rate is a calculation which combines the Ordinary Pay and any Bonus Pay received on 

the relevant census dates. Ordinary Pay itself is a combination of basic pay, allowances, pay for piecework, 
pay for leave, and shift premium pay.

•  Ordinary pay does not include overtime, redundancy/termination payments, payment in lieu of leave, or 

other remunerations that are not money.

•  Gross pay is calculated after the deduction of salary sacrifice payments, but before all other taxes.

•  Only staff who are considered “full pay relevant employee” are included in the calculation. Any staff who 

were not receiving their full hourly pay equivalent because of a reduced payment, such as statutory 
maternity or sickness pay, are excluded.

•  The calculation is based on posts, and not individual people. Where an individual has 2 or more contracts 

or roles, they are included in the calculation as separate data sets.
