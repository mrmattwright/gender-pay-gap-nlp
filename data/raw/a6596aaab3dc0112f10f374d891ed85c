Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 
Nestlé in the UK

Striving for diversity and inclusion
Having a workforce that is diverse and inclusive is essential 
for a modern, sustainable and successful business. I believe 
that to be innovative, we need a balance of genders so that 
we can benefit from a diversity of styles, perspectives and 
decision-making. More importantly, our Nestlé values are 
rooted in respect and having a balance of genders is simply 
the right thing to do.

For these reasons, Nestlé supports action on 
closing the gender pay gap, and addressing 
gender balance in the workforce. 

At Nestlé, we have common principles of  
pay and bonus across all of our businesses, 
with the same pay grades and approaches 
to pay for men and for women. Having 
reviewed our data in depth, we see that 
we still have gender pay gaps and that 
unbalanced gender representation across  
our business units is at the heart of this.  

Looking at the figures across Nestlé in the 
UK, our pay gap currently shows women’s 
mean pay as 5% lower and median pay 7% 
lower than men. For the bonus pay gap, 
women are 8% lower at the mean, but 2% 
higher at the median. I encourage you to 
read this report for further information behind 
these figures and how the composition of 
our organisation impacts them. 

Looking at individual businesses, you will  
see that in some cases we have a gender 
pay gap in favour of women and, in others, in 
favour of men. As with many organisations in 
the manufacturing sector, our factories are 
predominantly male. In our offices we have 
better representation of women and, in many 
roles and business areas there is strong 
female representation. Where we have a 
gender pay gap in favour of women, we have 
achieved a more even gender balance at 
senior levels, leading to higher average pay 
and bonus rates. 

Our analysis has confirmed that across 
all our businesses there are opportunities 
to develop better gender balance. We 
are committed through our diversity and 
inclusion strategy to bring about this change. 
We are working hard to ensure we offer 
an inclusive workplace, playing our part in 
offering choices that support people to have 
a fulfilling career at all stages of life. We have 
great female role models in our businesses 
and we are always asking ourselves what 
more we can do. We will continue to strive 
for gender balance.

About Nestlé in the UK
We are part of the world’s largest food and drink company. We are 
a major player within the UK food industry, employing around 8,000 
people across 20 sites.

How we’re working to 
achieve the right balance

Within Nestlé in the UK, our employees 
are currently split 70:30 between men 
and women. Here are some examples 
of what we’re doing to alter the balance:
•   Networks and advocates
 Our gender networks make 
 
recommendations, and provide 
opportunities to learn how our 
business can improve gender 
balance. They also provide support 
to colleagues. They are run by 
advocates from around the business, 
including male and female senior 
leaders and sponsors at board level. 
In 2018, we’ll expand our network  
of Lean In groups and focus more on 
supporting females in technical and 
production roles. We’ll be helping to 
connect people and getting our role 
models to share their stories. 

•   Leadership development 
 

 We will continue to ensure we provide 
development at key stages of women’s 
careers including participating in the 
30% Club’s executive mentoring 
programme and sponsoring women 
to attend our global suite of leadership 
development programmes.

•   D&I training 
 

 In 2018, we will offer an increased 
range of training options on how 
to avoid potential unconscious bias 
when making key people decisions 
such as recruitment, performance 
and pay. Alongside this, we will 
offer sessions supporting people to 
manage their careers. 

•   Flexible working 
 

 Our HR team are exploring how we 
can build on the flexible working 
options we already have. We know 
that having a broad range of options 
enables us to be more inclusive 
and better support our employees 
throughout their career.

•   Parental support 
 

 We have pledged our support to  
the Equality and Human Rights 
Commission’s Working Forward 
campaign to better support parents at 
work. We are reviewing our family 
friendly policies and providing more 
information and support to our 
employees who are becoming 
parents.

•   Future workforce 
 

 We are working with schools and 
colleges to help students learn about 
employment opportunities in our 
industry, particularly encouraging 
young women to consider careers  
in STEM subjects.

 To calculate mean we add all the figures together and then divide by the number of figures. To calculate the median we arrange all figures in ascending order and take the middle figure. For the 
quartiles we arrange all figures in ascending order and split them into four equal sized groups.

Nestlé in the UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

What our data tells us

Across Nestlé in the UK, our pay gap currently shows women’s mean pay as 5% lower, and 
the median at 7% lower than men. Our data by business also shows a gender pay gap in 
favour of men in some businesses, and in favour of women in others, despite a clear and 
common approach to pay. These differences stem from variations in roles and gender balance 
in each business. Across all our businesses women are under-represented in factories, and we 
have opportunities for better gender balance in many of our leadership teams. 
This balance across roles also has an impact on the bonus pay gap, which we explain in more 
detail below.

 

Hourly rate pay gap 
in each business
Nestlé UK Ltd is the largest business in 
Nestlé in the UK. It includes our Nescafé, 
Nestlé Confectionery, Nestlé Food, Nestlé 
Nutrition, Nestlé Health Science and 
Nestlé Professional businesses as well as 
factories and corporate functions, such as 
Finance and Sales. Our overall gender pay 
gap is in favour of men. Representation 
of women is low in our factories. We 
need to look at how we can develop the 
gender balance of our leadership teams. 
And, while the proportion of women 
in our management roles is higher 
than the proportion of women overall 
in our business, and we have strong 
representation of women in some areas, 
the balance is still in favour of men.

In Nespresso UK Ltd we have a more 
even balance of genders across the 
business. Most people work in our coffee 

boutiques and customer service centre, 
with a slightly higher proportion of women. 
A relatively small number work in our 
offices and the gender split is equal. There 
are slightly more men in management roles. 
The mean gender pay gap is in favour of 
men and there is currently no median gap. 

Cereal Partners UK, Nestlé Purina 
Petcare (U.K.) Limited and Nestlé 
Waters UK Limited like Nestlé UK Ltd, 
have few women in their factory roles. 
There are also opportunities to increase 
gender balance in our leadership teams. 
In management we have stronger 
representation of women than overall and 
in some of the more senior management 
roles we are much closer to achieving 
gender balance. This is increasing the 
average hourly rate for women and  
results in a gap that favours women. 

Nestec York Ltd known locally as the 
Nestlé Product Technology Centre for 
Confectionery, has only 160 employees, 
so small differences have a big impact 
on the numbers. There is an opportunity 
to increase gender balance within the 
leadership team and, on average, men are 
in slightly more senior management roles. 
We see a gender pay gap in favour of men. 

 

Bonus pay in  
each business
Explaining the bonus pay gap figures is 
more complex. Clearly the same variations 
in roles and gender balance exist, but the 
figures are affected by more variables. 
These include the relevant business unit 
performance where bonus is directly 
linked to achieving specific goals. Time 
with the business is also a factor – those 
who have joined part-way through a bonus 
year must be included in the calculation 
in the same way as those who have 
been with us all year, although the bonus 
payment they receive will be pro-rata and 
therefore, less. Bonus figures are also 
exaggerated by the fact that management 
and leadership roles attract a higher level 
of bonus. All these variables are gender 
neutral but affect the numbers. This 
means in many cases our bonus data looks 
more extreme than our pay data. 

Our commitment

We are committed to being an inclusive business – which is why we will continue to actively 
drive our diversity and inclusion strategy, guided by our values that are rooted in respect. 
Gender balance remains a key priority and we continue to strive towards this across Nestlé 
in the UK. We are confident that achieving a change in our gender balance is the right place 
to start to reduce our gender pay gaps. We will also continue to consider all our practices to 
ensure we best reflect the general population and build a truly inclusive culture.
