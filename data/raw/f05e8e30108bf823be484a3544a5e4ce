Introduction 
The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations (2017) requires businesses with more than 250 employees to publish gender pay gap statistics. Gender Pay Gap Reporting looks at the average earnings within a business 
across all jobs, levels and salaries. Gender pay gap reporting is not about equal pay for men and women doing the same jobs, this has been a legal requirement for many years and Eaton has robust processes in place to ensure equality of 
pay. It is about making sure companies recognize and understand pay gaps where they exist.  
Eaton recognizes and understands its gender pay gap and is committed to reporting annually the actions being taken and the progress being made to reduce the gap. As of 5 April 2017, Eaton had 10 employing legal entities in the UK, 3 
of which had more than 250 employees. The results detailed here are the overall results for Eaton’s UK businesses (Eaton UK), a full breakdown of the results of the applicable legal entities are shown on page two. 
 
Eaton UK’s 2017 gender pay gap 

Tackling gender diversity at Eaton 

Eaton  is  a  manufacturing  company  that  relies  heavily  on  the  high-skilled 
workers  from  science,  technology,  engineering  and  mathematics  (STEM) 
related fields. As of 2016, only 21 percent of the UK’s core STEM workforce is 
female (Wise Statistics, 2016) and this is reflected in Eaton’s gender diversity.  
We  believe  that  our  gender  pay  gap  is  driven  by  the  roles  in  which men  and 
women  work  within  the  organization  and  the  salaries  that  these  roles  attract. 
Currently 75 percent of our female population work as production operatives or 
in  administrative  roles.  In  order  to  tackle  our  gender  pay  gap,  we  need  to 
increase the number of females in more senior positions in the organization. 
Eaton UK pay quartiles by gender can be seen below: 

Mean gender pay gap 
Median gender pay gap 
Mean gender bonus gap* 
Median gender bonus gap** 
Proportion of employees receiving a bonus 

 

24.1% 
21.1% 
29.3% 
-16.5% 
Male: 53%  Female: 47% 

* Eaton  operates  an Executive Incentive Compensation plan for its  senior  employees and the  mean gender bonus 
gap of 29.3 percent is reflective of the points mentioned above.  
** The median gender bonus gap of -16.5 percent is due to the higher number of men than women in facilities that 
operate site-wide bonus schemes. 
 

At  Eaton,  we  are  focused  on  ensuring  that  we  create  and  benefit  from  a 
strong, talented, diverse workforce at all levels of the organization. 

We  are  committed  to  promoting career  paths  for  women  in  engineering  at 
the  earliest  opportunity  in  order  to  develop  a  strong  pipeline  of  high-
performing talent. We recognize that in the short term this may increase our 
gender  pay  gap,  as  we  recruit  more  females  into  entry  level  roles,  but  we 
believe this to be an essential part of our long term strategy. In recent years, 
a number of actions have been put in place: 

• Local school & college outreach: Employees from many of our sites connect with local schools, 
attend  career  days,  host  site  tours  and  promote  careers  in  STEM.  In  the  coming  years,  we  will 
continue with these activities and leverage the opportunities presented by the Apprenticeship Levy. 

• Internships & graduates: In 2017, one third of Eaton’s interns were female − a real achievement 
given  that  women  only  represent  15.8  percent  of  engineering  and  technology  undergraduates 
(Women  in  STEM  facts  and  statistics  2012-2015).  Eaton  ensures  female  representation  at  all 
graduate recruitment fairs. 

• Professional engineers: We are an active partner of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and 
we advertise our experienced engineering roles on relevant websites, such as those of the SWE and 
the Women's Engineering Society (WES). We also audit gender diversity within our  
recruitment process. 

 

Eaton understands that achieving a diverse workforce also comes from reinforcing a positive culture of 
inclusion and the company does this in many ways: 

• Training:  In  2017,  Valuing  Inclusion  &  Diversity  training  was  rolled  out  to  Eaton’s  UK  leaders  to 

embrace inclusive ways of working that engage and develop employees. 

• Collaboration:  Eaton  supports  the  creation  of  collaborative  work  groups  and  the WAVE  (Women 
Adding Value at Eaton) group has funded Personal Impact and Leadership training in the UK as well 
as  organizing  presentations 
inspirational  women,  roundtable  events  and  networking 
opportunities to help women at all levels develop and enhance their careers. 

from 

• Flexible working: Eaton understands the need for work life balance and supports flexible working 

requests. In addition, Eaton UK employees have the opportunity to purchase additional holidays.
