              Ted’s Gender Pay Gap Report 2017           Ted’s Gender Pay Gap Report 2017      Ted's Responsibilities Section Menu    Sustainability & the Environment People Supply Chain Transparency and Modern Slavery Statement Ted’s Gender Pay Gap Report 2017      Ted’s Gender Pay Gap Report: No Ordinary Designer Label Limited  Period to 5 April 2017  Introduction  At Ted we value diversity, inclusion and strive for equality for each and every employee within the Group.  Strong core values and culture within Ted endorses a diverse and talent led workforce.  As part of the UK Government’s commitment to tackling gender pay inequality, organisations with 250 or more employees are required to publish calculations for 6 key metrics each year to disclose pay gaps that may exist between male and female employees.  At the date of 5 April 2017, No Ordinary Designer Label Limited employed 1,737 employees over a wide range of functions and working patterns across the business.  Ted’s employee demographic – 1,737 UK employees in total  1,235 UK Retail employees 60 UK Warehouse employees 442 Head Office employees   Gender Pay Gap   Gender split at Ted is 64%  women, 36% men.  Women at Ted are paid 6.2% more  than men as a median measure (National average is 18.4% in favour of men).  Women at Ted are paid 15% less  than men as a mean measure (National average is 17.4% in favour of men).  Mean Gender Pay Gap is driven  by a small population of senior executives where the gender ratio is  predominantly male.   Gender Bonus Gap   57.2% of all women employees  and 60.9% of all men received a bonus in the period.  The median bonus gap was 17.2%  in favour of women.  The mean bonus gap was 77.9% in  favour of men.  If Long Term Incentive Plan  share options (LTIP) awarded to long serving senior executives are excluded  from the bonus calculations, the mean bonus gap falls to 11% in favour of men  and the median bonus gap increases to 23.9% in favour of women.   Ted’s Gender Demographic Per Pay Quartile  Quartile analysis shows women are well represented across all pay levels.      Women  Men    Top Quartile  62%  38%    Upper Middle Quartile  70%  30%    Lower Middle Quartile  65%  35%    Lower Quartile  56%  44%    Ted’s Summary of Findings  Our findings demonstrate that while a gender pay gap exists at Ted, it is distorted due to a relatively small group of executives where the gender ratio is predominately male.  LTIP options that vested in the period to this small group significantly skew’s the overall metrics.  Ted is confident that male and female employees in the same or similar roles or roles considered of equal value across the business are paid within a fair range.  A leading representation of women exists in all pay quartiles demonstrating inherent diversity and inclusion of women at all levels of seniority.  Within the retail store population of which represents 71% of the total employee population, the gender pay gap is minimal at 0.1% in favour of men.  Ted will continue to value diversity in all areas of its business and will measure and externally benchmark the way our population is remunerated on an ongoing basis.  Ted can confirm that the data has been calculated according to the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 for the period to 5 April 2017.  This information can also be found on the government portal at  https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/viewing/search-results  Toni Phillips-Munday  Ted’s Coach – No Ordinary Designer Label Limited  3 April 2018  Ted’s Definitions  Equal Pay – Considers that men and women should generally receive equal pay if they perform equal work.  This includes like work, work rated as equivalent or work of equal value.
