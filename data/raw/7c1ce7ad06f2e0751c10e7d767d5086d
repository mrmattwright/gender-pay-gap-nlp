The company’s Gender Pay Reporting is as follows:  Mean Gender Pay Gap: 11.1%  Median Gender Pay Gap: 15.4%  Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap: -74.3%  Median Bonus Gender Pay Gap: 51.2%  Proportion of males receiving a bonus: 11.5%  Proportion of females receiving a bonus: 13.2%        Quartile    Male    Female      Upper Pay Quartile    47%    53%      Upper Middle Pay Quartile    35%    65%      Lower Middle Pay Quartile    24%    76%      Lower Pay Quartile    37%    63%          SUPPORTING STATEMENT  LAW Absolute Limited is a specialist legal recruiter, supplying a diverse range of candidates to a broad spectrum of client organisations.  The majority of the data underlying our Gender Pay Reporting relates to workers we supply to clients and the hiring and remuneration decisions in respect of those individuals lies with our clients.  The above numbers also include our own staff and that subset shows a narrower Mean Gender Pay Gap of 7.3% but a wider Median Gender Pay Gap of 53.9%. This latter measure reflects a higher proportion of female staff and directors in non-fee earning roles which do not attract commission payments.  The company is satisfied that any Gender Pay Gaps within our own staff is a function of the gender mix between different roles and, within fee earning roles, is a reflection of individual performance and the resultant impact on commission earnings.  This statement confirms that the published information is accurate as at the time of publishing.
