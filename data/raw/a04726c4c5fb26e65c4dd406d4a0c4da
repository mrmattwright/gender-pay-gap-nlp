Arnold Clark is highly supportive of the government’s decision to require big employers to publish their gender pay gap statistics.  Our aims are to:   Challenge traditional perceptions of car sales.  Create more flexible, less formal roles across the organisation.  Introduce a five-day working week for sales.  Continue to invest and grow our apprenticeship programme to attract diverse talent and fresh ideas.  Challenge gender stereotypes within the industry.      Want to read more?
