REPORT DATE: 5TH APRIL 2017 

Produced by E. Fulcher 

 

INTRODUCTION 

Employers  with  250  or  more  employees  are  now  legally  required  to  publish,  on  an  annual  basis,  certain 
information relating to their gender pay gap. This statement sets out the relevant information for Fish N Chick 
N Ltd, for the period 05/04/2017. This information has been calculated in accordance with the requirements of 
the gender pay gap regulations. 

We have also included in this statement more detailed information beyond that which is legally required to be 
published to help explain our overall approach to pay and equality. 

WHAT IS THE GENDER P AY GAP? 

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage. 
The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. Equal pay is concerned with pay differences between men and 
women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally 
because they are a man or a woman. 

Nationally, the gender pay gap has persisted for many years — while the gap has been closing, overall progress 
has been, and remains, very slow. The size of the gap varies between the private, public and voluntary sectors, 
by different types of businesses/services and by other factors, such as the age of employees. The Government 
has introduced these new reporting requirements to try and improve the rate of progress in closing this pay 
gap. 

There are many factors which contribute to, or cause, a gender pay gap, and these will vary between different 
employers. Some relate to wider society, such as the type of career choices men and women have typically 
tended to make, and some may be specific to the particular organisation. We have set out in this statement the 
main factors we consider are contributing to our gender pay gap.

EQUALITY & DIVERSITY  

Fish  N  Chick  N  Ltd  aims  to  be  a  fair  and 
progressive  employer  and  is  committed  to 
tackling inequality and promoting diversity. Its 
employment  arrangements  comply  with  all 
relevant  equality  legislation  and  codes  of 
practice  and  are  regularly  monitored  by 
gender and role to ensure no discrimination or 
other unfairness occurs.  

PAY & REWARD 

into 

account 

Fish N Chick N’s pay arrangements aim to fairly 
reward  staff  contribution  and  performance, 
taking 
economic/financial 
considerations,  organisational  and  individual 
performance and the pay rates of similar roles 
in  the  wider  economy.  Weekly  Bonuses  are 
earned by Store Management and are directly 
attributable  to  the  financial  performance  of 
the unit.   

 

 

These  pay  (and  bonus)  arrangements  are 
regularly  monitored  by  gender  and  role  to 
ensure  no  discrimination  or  other  unfairness 
occurs.

RESULTS OF THE GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

Our gender pay gap results are considerably higher than the national average, this is likely 
to be met with considerable negativity. However, the reasons for the results are relatively 
simple and are explained over the following pages. 

It should also be noted that the company is focused on taking meaningful action to drive 
equality & inclusivity, and steps have already been taken to drive change. Unfortunately, 
there are no quick wins, but we are confident that we can close the gender pay gap over 
time.

We consider the main causes of the above gaps are: 

•  Women  are  under-represented  within  managerial  roles  where  remuneration  is 
higher (this is typical within our Industry and is largely driven by historical culture)  

Our staff structuring has changed very little over the past 30 years. Each of our stores a run 
by a full-time management team of 2 staff (generally a manager and assistant manager) 
and a  team of part-time ‘team members’. At 05/04/2017, 87 of the 472  staff employed 
were of management level.

At present our most flexible roles are those of a ‘team member’. These positions tend to 
be fulfilled by younger workers looking for a smaller number of hours of work per week and 
females with the additional responsibility of caring for their children or older relatives.

We are analysing our managerial rota’s to identify whether adapting a more flexible pattern 
is feasible. We understand that this will be attractive to both our male & female staff and 
may also have a positive impact on our recruitment strategy.

Our managerial staff are able to earn bonuses based on the performance of the store they 
are  working  within.  At  present,  there  is  no  bonus/incentive  scheme  for  non-managerial 
roles.

The split of staff through the quartiles helps to describe some of the Gender Pay Gap: 

•  Upper Quartile: All of our management staff are captured within this quartile. In 

addition, some of the management trainee staff & relief fryers (part-time role) 

•  Upper Middle Quartile: This  quartile generally  includes our longest  serving and 

• 

highest paid ‘team members’, all of whom work part-time. 
Lower  Middle  &  Lower  Quartiles:  These  quartiles  include  part-time  staff,  the 
majority of which are younger workers (20 and younger) who prefer to work less 
hours per week 

The information set out in this Gender Pay Gap Report is accurate. The results 
are representative of our employees at 05/04/2017.

OUR COMMITMENT TO GENDER BALANCE 

ACTIONS TO ADDRESS  THE PAY GAP 

We are committed to closing our pay gaps, as reported above, and we are in the process of 
developing an action plan which seeks to do so. We will engage with and involve employees 
in developing this. Once established, these will need a period of time to take effect. We will 
be monitoring progress on a regular basis and reporting on this in future gender pay gap 
statements. 

Actions we already are, and we will continue to undertake: 

• 

review pay and bonus procedures and practices to ensure they are applied fairly 
and equitably 

•  monitor the outcomes of management decisions in relation to pay and bonus to 

ensure no gender, or other, bias is occurring 

The actions we expect to be taking within our action plan include, for example: 

•  make closing our gender pay gap a priority for our executive committee 

• 

• 

engage with others within our industry to drive change and reduce the gender pay 
gap 

review recruitment processes to try and attract more female candidates for roles 
in which they currently are under-represented 

•  work  more  closely  with  schools/colleges  to  develop  a  better  understanding  of 
employment  opportunities  within  the  organisation,  including  offering  “taster” 
work experience placements 

• 

• 

consider  how  different  types  of  flexible  working  can  be  made  more  widely 
available 

introducing  specific  learning  and  development  programmes  and  other  forms  of 
career support to help more women progress within the organisation 

These actions will be part of, and integrated with, our broader approach to equality and 
diversity.
