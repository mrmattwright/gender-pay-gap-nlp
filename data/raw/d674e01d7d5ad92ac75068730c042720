West Kent & Ashford College has carried out a snapshot data, with a requirement that work is undertaken to narrow any gaps.      The Mandatory Gender Pay Gap Reporting proposes that organisations should, for the first mandatory report, capture data as a snapshot on 5th April 2017 and then publish their findings no later than 4th April 2018. This cycle will then continue year on year going forward with organisations being required to maintain the data on their websites for three years in order to show progress made.  The Equality and Human Rights Commission defines the difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap as follows:   Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive equal pay, as set out in the Equality Act 2010.  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.   West Kent and Ashford College   Our mean pay gap is 8.3% and our median is 9.28% which is significantly better than the national average. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, the national median pay gap for all employees of 18.1% in 2016. As part of the mandatory reporting process, employers are required to publish the gender pay gap within their bonuses. We did not award bonuses this year and therefore will not be able to report a bonus gender pay gap.
