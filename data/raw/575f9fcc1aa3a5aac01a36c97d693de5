Mean Vs Median Analysis Results 

The analysis conducted on 5th April 2017 shows an overall pay gap of 10% based on Median hourly 
pay  (23%  for  Mean).  This  compares  favourably  against  the  widely  cited  UK  Office  of  National 
Statistics (ONS) Median of 18.1% for 2016.  

The  median  perhaps  provides  the  more  accurate  picture  as  it  uses  the  middle  placed  salary, 
whereas the  mean calculates the overall average of  the sample and can be skewed by a small 
number of statistical outliers on very high or lower salaries. This further supports the ONS findings 
of the proportion of men and women at the represented in the upper and lower quartiles.

Proportion of Males and Females in each pay quartile 

The analysis of the gender demographic is consistent with what you would typically expect within 
a business and industry of this type.  

Our results show that there tend to be more females than male employees within the lower and 
lower  middle  pay  quartiles.  This  supports  our  understanding  that  these  lower  paid  roles  in 
operational areas, which tend to be casual or part time, may commonly attract females or those 
looking for increased flexibility. This is also consistent with wider ONS findings of 41% of women 
working part time verses 12% of men.   

Proportion of Males & Females in each pay quartile 

As we review the upper middle and upper quartiles we see the balance of the workforce shift 
towards  male  employees.  This  is  particularly  apparent  in  the  upper  quartile  which  contains  a 
number of our senior management and leadership positions. It is important to note that these 
senior positions may be singular roles and be the aforementioned statistical outliers within the 
data.   

It should be noted that it is this spread of the ratio of male/female employees that creates the 
pay gap as equal pay is consistent with all employees working within the same position in each 
of the given quartiles. 

Overall our business mix and male / female ratio is very evenly balanced at 49% female and 51% 
Male.

Analysis Results Bonus Pay Gap

HCR Ltd operates a number of incentive, commission and bonus schemes which are open to a 
number of employees working in specific roles. 

Schemes  operate  against  defined  set  criteria  which  are  not  gender  specific.  The  analysis 
conducted  on  5th  April  2017  shows  184  employees  (57%  of  the  workforce)  were  eligible  to 
participate  within  one  of  the  company  bonus  schemes.  Our  results  show  that  overall  bonus 
distribution between male and female employees is almost equal at 51% & 52%.

The two result tables show an equal proportion of both male and female employees benefit from 
the bonus structure at HCR Ltd. The mean pay gap of 15% again is in line with proportional bonus 
payments, with the median favouring females ever so slightly.

Our  overall  findings  of  figures  support  our  understanding  of  our  business  and  show  that  the 
majority of the gap is due to a lower number of females in senior roles with higher percentage in 
more flexible or part time operational positions.
