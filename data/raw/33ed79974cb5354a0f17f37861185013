At the snapshot date of 5 April 2017, Secom had 703 full-pay relevant employees of which 330 were fire and security system engineers. Only 3 of these (1%) were female which is common in our industry which struggles to attract female applicants for these roles. The company had 221 office administration, alarm receiving centre and call centre staff, 73% of which were female. The market rate of pay for engineers is significantly higher than the market rate of pay for these office based staff. This is a major cause of the gender pay gap that Secom has. In addition, the company has a policy of promotion from within whenever possible. The natural career progression is therefore engineer to supervisor to manager to director. At the snapshot date, the company had 87 managers and supervisors of which 9 were female (10%) mainly in areas such as marketing, finance and HR. There is a similar trend in salespeople where the company had 43 sales staff of which only 1 was female. These staff tend to come with an engineering background which is very helpful when designing fire and security systems. The market rate of pay for managers, supervisors and sales staff is significantly higher than the office staff that are predominantly female adding to the gender pay gap. Significant bonus/commission payments are made to the sales team which is 98% male. These are a key part of their reward structure as is customary in sales roles. These payments are far greater than the other bonus and incentive payments made to other staff and hence that causes the bonus pay gap.  Secom plc is committed to reducing the gender pay gap, but recognises the challenge in attracting female staff into the engineering side of this business. The company has an Ofsted audited academy for apprentices and as an initial step has set a target of 10% of apprentice engineers to be female with a commitment to increase this further in future years. Whilst this will not be easy, the company will target marketing at the female market to try to encourage more female applicants. As the female proportion of engineers grows, this will naturally lead to an increasing proportion of female sales staff, supervisors and managers. By doing this the company hopes to reduce the gender pay gap every year moving forward but recognises that this may be a long process in such a male orientated industry.”            About Us Partners  Accreditations  Awards  Gender Pay Gap Reporting  Policy statements  Corporate Social Responsibility  Careers           Terms Of Use  Privacy  About Us  Modern Slavery Statement  Policies  Contact Us   © 2018 Copyright SECOM Plc    International sites:   Japan  Australia  Korea  China  Taiwan  Indonesia  Singapore  Malaysia  Thailand                  Follow @SECOMPlc      This site uses cookies.
