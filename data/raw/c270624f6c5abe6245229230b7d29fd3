Equality and Diversity Policy  We, at the University, are committed to providing an environment which seeks to encourage an open and diverse community. This is reflected in our values and behaviours where we respect the rights and dignity of all people whatever their background.  By consistently living our values, we seek to eliminate those things that undermine or are harmful to anyone involved in the activities of our University. We therefore believe that unlawful discrimination, intimidation or harassment of anyone connected with the Univeristy, specifically related to their race, religion or belief, age, gender reassignment, sex, sexual orientation, disability, marital or partnership status or maternity and pregnancy cannot be tolerated. In addition we strive to advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between people from these protected groups. However, as a learning organisation we will provide an environment where people can address and debate differences and constantly reflect on practices.  We recognise that our business practices, decisions and actions have the potential to impact disproportionately on certain groups or individuals and will therefore review relevant key policies and practices as well as major business changes. We will constantly reflect on our activities and be open and transparent about changes that have a major effect on employees or students.  We aspire to be recognised by the local community and the sector as an organisation that leads the way in publicly promoting the value of diverse cultures and our belief that these different experiences make our University a better place to work and study.  The aims and objectives of this policy will be addressed through the University's Single Equality Strategy, quality processes, annual monitoring, business planning, policies, procedures and guidelines.
