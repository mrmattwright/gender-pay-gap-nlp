What are the underlying causes of Kloeckner Metals UK’s gender pay gap?
Under the law, men and women must receive equal pay for:

• the same or broadly similar work.
• work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or
• work of equal value.

Kloeckner Metals UK is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all 
employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/
maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. It has a clear policy of paying employees 
equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristic set out above). 
As such, it:
 

• carries out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals.
• evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure.

Kloeckner Metals UK is therefore confident that its gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and 
women differently for the same or equivalent work. Rather its gender pay gap is the result of the roles in 
which men and women work within the organisation and the salaries that these roles attract.

The pattern from the UK economy as a whole is not necessarily reflected in the make-up of Kloeckner 
Metals UK’s workforce, although clearly there is a male dominated workforce in terms of employee 
numbers (12.5% female) . We find that female employees are more likely to be in the higher pay quartiles. 
As can be seen below:

How does Kloeckner Metals UK’s gender pay gap compare with that of other organisations?

The vast majority of organisations have a gender pay gap, and we are pleased to be able to say that 
Kloeckner Metals UK’s gap compares favourably with that of other organisations. 

The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 Office for National 
Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17.5%, At minus 10.56%

Kloeckner Metals UK’s mean gender pay gap is, therefore, significantly lower than that for the whole 
economy.

The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 ONS ASHE figures) 
is 19.2%. At minus 15.37%, Kloeckner Metals UK’s median gender pay gap is significantly lower than that 
of the whole economy.

The proportion of men at Kloeckner Metals UK who received a bonus in the 12 months up to 5 April 2017 
was 69.65%, while for women this was 73.8%. With 0% gender pay gap on median bonus payments due to 
the most frequent type of bonus paid, being a scorecard bonus of equal value.

What is Kloeckner Metals UK doing to address its gender pay gap?

While Kloeckner Metals UK’s gender pay gap compares favourably with that of organisations across the UK 
economy, this is not a subject about which Kloeckner Metals UK is complacent. 

However, Kloeckner Metals UK also recognises that its scope to act is limited in some areas - it has, for 
example, no direct control over the career choices that an individual may make. The industry in which 
we operate is traditionally a male dominated one, particularly in relation to roles involving, process, Plant 
and Machine Operatives, which form the vast majority of the Kloeckner Metals UK workforce, and it is this 
area where we have struggled to recruit.  Although, we have seen an improvement in being able to recruit 
females in area’s such as sales , head office support functions and other senior positions which is reflected 
in our gender pay gap figures.

Kloeckner Metals UK has taken to promote gender diversity in all areas of its workforce and aim to identify 
any barriers to gender equality and inform priorities for action, by analysing;

• the proportions of men and women applying for jobs and being recruited.
• the proportions of men and women applying for and obtaining promotions.
• the proportions of men and women leaving the organisation and their reasons for leaving.
• the numbers of men and women in each role and pay band.
• the proportion of men and women who return to their original job after a period of maternity or other 
parental leave; and
• the proportion of men and women still in post a year on from a return to work after a period of maternity                            
or other parental leave.

Kloeckner Metals UK is committed to reporting on an annual basis on what it is doing to reduce the gender 
pay gap and the progress that it is making.

I, Kaha Avaliani, Executive Vice President Region West, confirm that the information in this statement is 
accurate.
