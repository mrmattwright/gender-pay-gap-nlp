Gender Pay Reporting

Introduction

Under new legislation, UK employers are required to publish key metrics on their 
gender pay gap. SIG plc (“SIG”) believes in providing equal opportunities and we’re 
pleased to comply with these new regulations. The gender pay gap data will be 
a valuable tool and help us to focus our attention on attracting and developing a 
diverse workforce.

What impacts the pay and bonus gap at SIG?
The distribution industry faces a challenge to attract more 
women into the sector and we’re no different in this respect. 
Due to the demographics of our workforce, there’s an under-
representation of women in all roles, particularly in the most 
senior roles, which is the main cause of our mean and median 
pay gaps in favour of men.

Bonus pay gaps are impacted by the relative seniority of the 
male and female populations. Seniority has a direct impact 
on the salaries of each population (reflected in the mean and 
median pay gap results) and an indirect impact on the bonus 
opportunity of individuals (i.e. individuals in more senior  
roles tend to have a larger bonus opportunity as a percentage 
of salary).

As a distributor of specialist building products, we’ve 
traditionally attracted a very high proportion of male  
employees. While we’re working hard to encourage more 
females into the business, around 79% of our current  
employee population is male, including a high percentage  
of males employed in senior positions. 

Our employee population is reflective of the distribution 
sector as a whole, where men have traditionally been highly 
represented. We’ve already taken steps to attract more females 
to our business and will continue to increase our focus on 
diversity across SIG. 

What is the gender pay gap and how does it relate  
to equal pay?
Gender pay is not the same as equal pay. The gender pay gap 
shows the difference in the average pay between all men and 
women across a whole organisation. One of the most significant 
influencing factors on the gender pay gap is the distribution 
of males and females between grades. In addition, there are a 
number of drivers of pay differences that may mean people in 
the same role receive different pay, for example: experience, 
tenure and geographic location. 

Equal pay deals with pay differences between men and women 
who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. 
The equal pay principle, set out in the Equality Act 2010, is that 
men and women performing equal work must receive equal 
pay, unless there is a material reason (not linked to gender) that 
justifies a difference.

Taking action

Our mean gender pay gap is significantly lower than the national average of 17.4% 
and the average for our industry of 15.9%. However, we’re committed to equality 
and undertake regular analysis and monitoring of pay where we’ll continue to work 
to remedy our gender pay gap.

We’re committed to providing equal opportunities and increasing the 
diversity of our workforce. We have a Diversity and Equal Opportunities 
Policy and a Board Diversity Policy.

We’re also already undertaking several initiatives to increase diversity 
across our business, including:

• 

Recruitment of females (ensuring equal opportunities and improved  
female representation)

•  Developing more flexible working policies
•  Mentoring programmes
• 

Participating member of the Disability Confident employer scheme

We know it will take a long-term commitment to significantly change the 
makeup of our workforce and of the sector, so we’ll continue with these 
efforts to make SIG plc a diverse employer of choice.
