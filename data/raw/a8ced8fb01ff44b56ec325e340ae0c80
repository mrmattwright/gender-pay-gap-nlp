Find Out More        UU have been working hard to improve our customer service and associated SIM scores...we have moved from last place three years ago to fourth in the last quarterly results. I am aware that Gallagher have played a key part in this in the Manchester region with much improved workforce deployment, new technology and improved impact awareness. Please pass on my thanks to your management and staff for the part they have played in the latest results.  Steven Fraser - Managing Director, United Utilities    The United Utilities AMP5 contract presented us all with a real challenge to deliver more for less with a clear focus on customer delivery. Gallagher responded to the challenge and have been pivotal to the improvements that we realised in street works compliance, customer experience and efficiency. Gallagher continue to lead the way amongst their peers and continually demonstrate collaborative behaviours by sharing best practice.  Kevin Fowlie - Business Director, Amey    Following April’s positive start to the year, we have achieved some notable milestones in May...a connections score of 90.6% (our highest ever) and 1 st position (our first time ever). A fantastic achievement, with a special mention to the connections team for achieving pole position. The standard’s been set – well done everybody and let’s keep it going!    Steph Rourke - Head of Customer Experience, ENWL    As we are accustomed to, T&K Gallagher have proven to be a great partner on the United Utilities New Connections and Metering contract. Without their can do attitude, product experience and ability to respond at such short notice, we would not have been able to provide the seamless transition for United Utilities that we did when mobilising under such difficult circumstances.  Campbell Crawford – Delivery Director, Amey    Yesterday evening we received the customer satisfaction results...I am delighted that all the efforts of our teams have delivered a result of 4.69 ranking us joint 1st in the Industry, this compares to 4.46 and a position of 9th in the year prior. This is an exceptional and outstanding performance. I wish to pass on my thanks for the hard work and commitment of Gallagher for delivering a great result on which to build on.
