Read More     Welcome from the  Headteacher Sunil Chotai School days are absolutely crucial in a young person’s life.  Success achieved in school often forms the bedrock on which our future achievements are constructed upon – a time when attitudes are formed, interests are awakened, and characters are forged. I know that choosing a Secondary School for your son or daughter is a time of anxiety, concern and great excitement. As a parent you obviously want the very best for your children and you will be looking for a school where they will experience success, be happy and fulfilled.  Charles Darwin is a school where students thrive both academically and socially. We believe in making the most of every ability and talent, we do this by offering a broad and balanced curriculum with a strong emphasis on the vital, core subjects of English, Maths, Science and the Humanities.

The role of Head Girl is something I have aspired to since I started Charles Darwin School in Year 7. Being successful in my application is an achievement of which I am extremely proud. Not only this, but it is also a way to give back to the staff here for their constant support and guidance and for making my school life so enjoyable.
As well as pushing me academically, the school has also given me an array of opportunities to become a well-rounded individual. These include being part of the school productions, attending outside lectures, trips, being involved in almost every sports team and more recently, becoming a mentor and my role as head girl.  It is due to these experiences throughout my time at Charles Darwin School that I have learned many valuable lessons and made countless wonderful memories which I will cherish and take forward into the next steps of my life.
I feel as though my experience at Charles Darwin School has prepared me for life after Sixth Form and I cannot wait to see what the future holds.

Head Boy - Callum

I have always aspired to be Head Boy ever since joining Charles Darwin School in Year 7 and I am now extremely proud that I can represent the school that formed me into the person I am today. 
The constant support of the staff has allowed me to develop as a person both academically and otherwise.  Through the opportunities the school provides in sport teams I have developed qualities such as leadership, cooperation and teamwork. I have thoroughly enjoyed school trips: whether it was a skiing trip in the Easter half term or a computer science lecture in London, the school has given me these chances to do something that I would have never thought possible within school.
I have thoroughly enjoyed my first year in the Sixth Form, and I greatly look forward to making the most of my last year here at Charles Darwin School.

From a young anxious child I have become a confident teenager over the last two years at Charles Darwin School. The support I have had so far from the school has been incredible. This has helped me achieve Platinum effort since year 7, Jack Petchey award nomination and plenty of certificates of achievement. The school is fantastic and I always give 100% effort. Year 9 Serena This year I received the Certificate of Excellence for Drama. I have been Platinum effort throughout year 9 and have had 100% attendance. I have been in the majority of school productions and a Student Voice representative. School is fun but also a serious place to learn. The school has really helped me to develop confidence. Year 13 Louise I am currently studying Mathmatics, English, History and performing arts at A Level after achieving 2A*, 4A and 3 B grades at GCSE. I am hoping to channel these skills and qualifications that I have acquired at Charles Darwin School into pursuing a career in Law.
I have been lucky enough to win Jack Petchey for my contribution to the school, excellent behaviour and have taken part in dance competitions, show and have taken an active role in the Duke of Edinburgh expedition scheme. Year 10 Jake I am really proud to be part of Charles Darwin School. In year 8 I have been nominated as Student Voice representative and I am in the rugby team. The most important thing I have achieved is perseverance and resilience. The school is a friendly place to be and learning in class is excellent. Year 10 William Charles Darwin School has given me a wealth of opportunities and opened up my way of thinking, as well as pushing me in the top set with challenging lessons in subjects like English, Maths and Science. I am really enjoying the experiences that I have taken part in. I’ve made great friends here and am excited about the GCSE and A Level challenges ahead. Year 10 Anna I am a member of the School Council and Student Voice. Charles Darwin School is an amazing place to be. They have given me so many opportunities and boosted my confidence so much! Discipline and education is of a very high standard. Year 9 Susanna I take part in several clubs including Geography club, book club and the choir. I participate in the netball team and am a librarian. The teachers are all really passionate about their subject and this shows in lessons, which makes them more fun. This is especially true for Maths. I am really happy here and have found some great friends.   /           Gallery  View full gallery               Information  Charles Darwin School, Jail Lane,
