The term “gender pay gap” refers to the difference in hourly earnings between men and women working in the same organisation.  The way in which companies have to report this data is clearly prescribed by the government. Please click the link below to see the specific requirements.  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gender-pay-gap-reporting  Gender pay reporting is not the same as reporting on equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value.  Hogg Robinson is committed to the principles of equality of opportunity and equal pay for roles of equal value -  regardless of gender. The figures below are set out in accordance with the new regulations which come into force in April 2018. The data represents 1,342 people in the UK in a variety of roles of whom just over two thirds are female.  We are confident that our gender pay gap does not arise from paying men and women differently for the same, or equivalent, work - but is a direct result of the varying roles throughout the organisation and the different levels of responsibility and experience which apply, regardless of employee gender.  Our figures  Hourly rate of pay  Our median “gender pay gap” is 31% while our mean “gender pay gap” is 43%. This means that there is a 43% difference between the average hourly pay for female employees at Hogg Robinson and the average hourly pay for male employees.  As highlighted above this primarily reflects a difference in the proportion of men and women in different roles and at different levels of seniority.  Males and females in the same roles with equal responsibility are paid the same.  Bonus pay  More than half of our female UK employees (55%) are in roles that attract bonus pay. This compares to 41% of the male population who are in bonus receiving roles. A significant proportion of men eligible for bonus however are in more senior roles where the bonus component forms a greater proportion of their total pay.  This results in a median “gender bonus gap” of 64% while the mean (average) “gender bonus gap” is 88%. This represents the group of employees who received bonus in the financial year 2016/2017.  Pay quartiles  The Regulations require companies to show the proportion of males and females at each of the pay quartiles set out below. The highest percentage of women in the Upper Middle Quartile in Hogg Robinson is a very encouraging signal for the future.    Quartile  % males  % females     Lower  23  77    Lower middle  19  81    Upper middle  28  72    Upper  58  42       In the UK and across our global network we are proud of our employees and the diversity we’ve achieved. However, as with many other companies,  differences in gender representation across seniority levels, as stated above, are a key influence on our gender pay gap figures and that is something which we have been actively seeking to address in our employment policies in recent years.  In particular, we are very pleased that we are increasingly able through family friendly programmes to attract more employees to return to work after career breaks, and to appeal to those workers with responsibilities at home as a carer. This includes working from home opportunities, split shift working, and home and term time working.  The Company is committed to monitoring and continuously improving equal opportunity. This includes identifying conscious and unconscious bias in employment and promotion opportunities and implicitly therefore reducing our gender pay gap.  Our on-going initiatives include;   Growing an agile workforce at all levels – 25% of our UK employees work from home, and we believe we can do more to encourage all employees irrespective of gender into more flexible roles and also promote our term-time working policies.  Leadership diversity – we believe that all of our employees deserve the opportunity to develop, so we’re committed to celebrating senior role models and ensuring our talent management initiatives seek to encourage diversity.  Hiring for success – HRG constantly seeks to refresh its recruitment processes to ensure an inclusive approach; for instance, we provide training in order to prevent unconscious and pre-existing biases from playing a hidden role in hiring decisions.  We are also introducing a return-ship program for those returning to work after a long-term career break.
