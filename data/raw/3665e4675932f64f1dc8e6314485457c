We provide our members with the influence, insight and access they need to plan ahead with confidence and grow. We represent their views as we work with policymakers to deliver a healthy environment for businesses to succeed, create jobs and ultimately, drive economic growth and prosperity.  It is our purpose to help business create a more prosperous society.  The CBI speaks on behalf of 190,000 businesses of all sizes and sectors. Together they employ nearly 7 million people, about one third of the private sector-employed workforce.  With 13 offices around the UK as well as representation in Brussels, Washington, Beijing and Delhi, the CBI communicates the British business voice around the world.  We provide our members with three core benefits:  Influence  By harnessing the collective strength of our members, we create a formidable force – keeping business at the heart of policy in Westminster, across the UK, the EU and overseas. We successfully shape the pro-enterprise policies that firms need to seize opportunities and tackle barriers to growth.  Insight  With the largest policy team outside Whitehall, we provide members with a wealth of cross-sector expertise to help their companies grow – from market leading surveys, forecasts and analysis to practical support and advice on policy changes and the issues that impact on business success.  Access  Our unrivalled networks enable members to meet and hear from senior business and political leaders, potential customers and suppliers. And our local, national and international meetings and events put members in touch with each other to share ideas, experiences and new market opportunities – providing them with the connections they need to compete and prosper.  The CBI is a not for profit, non-political Royal Charter company that is run by its members for its members.  The CBI’s gender pay gap report, March 2018  The CBI is committed to attracting a diversity of talented people into our organisation from all communities and walks of life. Our gender pay gap report shows that, like many organisations, we have more work to do to ensure all roles in our business are diverse. We have identified a range of actions to further close the pay gap in the coming year, as part of our broader efforts to address diversity in all forms.
