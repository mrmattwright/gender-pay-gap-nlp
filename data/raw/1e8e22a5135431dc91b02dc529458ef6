•  Gender pay differs from equal pay 

-  Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry 

out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value - it is unlawful to pay 
people unequally because of gender 

-  Gender pay shows the differences in the mean and median pay between men 

and women

•  The regulations require employers with a headcount of 250 or more employees to 
comply at a snapshot date (5 April 2017). The definition of employee is found in the 
Equality Act 2010, and includes employees (those with a contract of employment), 
workers & agency workers (those with a contract to do work or provide services) 
and some self-employed people (where they personally perform the work)

•  This report covers the Chelsea Football Club Foundation, which has over 250 

employees. Due to the composition of our businesses, the Foundation is reported 
as a separate entity from Chelsea Football Club Limited, which published its results 
last week
