GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 

Bellway Homes Limited, as the 
principal employer of the Bellway 
p.l.c. group of companies, presents its 
gender pay gap report for 2017.  

However, we recognise that the 
construction industry has been, 
and still is, generally regarded 
as a male-dominated industry. 

We are pleased to note that our mean 
gender pay gap of 15.8% is lower than 
the national average of 18.4% (Office 
for National Statistics provisional figure 
for 2017) however we are committed 
to closing the gap and improving 
diversity within Bellway as a whole.
We are committed to making 
appointments on merit, against 
objective criteria. 

This is demonstrated by the current 
composition of our workforce, where 
71% are males.

The gender pay gap (the difference 
in average pay between males and 
females) is because there are fewer 
women in more senior roles. The gender 
pay gap is different to pay equality 
which is about men and women 

receiving equal pay for work of 
equal value. 

The construction industry has 
historically attracted men and so those 
in senior positions, where significant 
industry experience is required, tend to 
be men. In addition, a large proportion 
of the relatively lower paid site-based 
construction roles, which are generally 
occupied by men, are outsourced to 
sub-contractors.  As a result the figures 
here do not provide the full picture as 
they include the managers but not all 
of the workers.  

The gender pay gap data is based on the hourly pay 
rate calculations for all of our 2,506 full-pay relevant 
employees and includes salary (after salary sacrifice), 
car allowance, travel allowance and any bonus or 
commission paid in the pay period ending 5th April 2017.  

The gender bonus pay gap data for bonuses paid in the 
year up to 5th April 2017 includes bonus, commission 
and income taxable proceeds on the exercise of 
discretionary long term incentive share awards.

The mean figures compare the average pay or bonus for a male employee with the average 

pay or bonus for a female employee across the whole company.

The median figures compare the pay or bonus of the male employee and the female employee 

who occupy the middle position when ranked in order of pay or bonus.

Although we are pleased to report that 78.7% 
of our female employees received a bonus 
compared to 68.6% of males, the median 
bonus pay of males is 10.0% higher than that 
of females. More women than men receive a 
bonus because our sales advisors, who earn 
commission, are predominantly female. 

We operate seven different bonus pay 
arrangements, depending on job role and 
level of seniority and so a like-for-like 
comparison between the pay quartiles is not 
meaningful. For example, bonus pay includes 
gains on long term incentive awards which 
are only provided to the executive directors 
of Bellway p.l.c. and senior management, 
the majority of whom are male. 

To address the gender gap in pay and 
bonus pay we will do the following:

•   Introduce diversity/equality training for all managers.
•   Reinforce the message that we are actively seeking to 
     encourage more women into construction with 
     our recruitment partners
•   Develop targeted recruitment campaigns focusing  
     on encouraging women into construction.
•   Focus on the number of women in senior roles as part of 
     our succession planning.
•   Pilot a returnship programme to encourage talented 
     women back into the workplace.
•   Identify mentors within the business who will help us 
     to develop future female talent and promote 
     good news stories.
•   Consider if there are barriers to progression for women 
     within Bellway and to take effective remedial action 
     where possible.
•   Contribute to industry-wide discussions on diversity.

Declaration

I confirm the information and data reported is accurate
