New legislation has come into force that requires companies with more than 250 employees
to publish data about their gender pay gap.

The following calculations must be shown:

• The median and mean gender pay gap
• The median and mean bonus gender pay gap
• The proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment
• The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band

Median and mean are both types of average. The median is the middle value if you place all
the numbers you are looking at in order. The mean is the total of all the numbers, divided by
how many numbers there are.

The quartile pay bands are calculated by putting everyone’s salary in order from the highest
paid to the lowest. That list is then cut into four equal parts and the percentage of men and
women in each part is then shown.

Equal pay vs gender pay

Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive equal pay.
It has been unlawful
since 1970 for employers in the UK to pay men and women differently for doing the same or a broadly similar job. However, when
looking at the gender pay gap there are many other reasons why, on average, levels of pay differ among men and women. For
example, we are aware that in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) industries, women only make up a fifth of
the work force.

Having reviewed our results, ENGIE is comfortable that we do not have an equal pay issue, although we recognise that there is work
for us to do to try and reduce our gender pay gap.

Under the Regulations we are required to report our gender pay gap data for each separate legal entity that has at least 250 employees and therefore we have reported data for ENGIE
Buildings LTD, ENGIE FM LTD, ENGIE Power LTD, ENGIE Services LTD, ENGIE Regeneration LTD and International Power LTD. We think it is important to consider the picture for all
employees so we have combined the information from all our entities, including Colledge Trundle & Hall LTD, Covion LTD, Ecova, inc. LTD, ENGIE Urban Energy LTD, QWest Services,
First Hydro Company and IPM Energy LTD to show ENGIE UK as a whole.

Understanding our gap

Our gender pay gap does not indicate an equal pay issue, when we
compare like for like roles. Our front line workforce is split more or less
evenly between the genders however as soon as we look at the more
senior management
the
proportion of female staff is significantly less than the men.

levels in the business, we can see that

This is somewhat explained by the sectors in which we work, in which
we understand that the number of female employees generally in the
market in those industries to be less than the men. However, we are
committed to encouraging and working towards a more even balance
between the genders in the senior levels of our business, to the extent
that this is possible. We note that 30% of our Executive Board is female.

Our Diversity and Inclusion Committee is focussed on understanding and
addressing what causes these gender imbalances.

Taking action on our gender pay gap (1)

Our gender pay gap is overwhelmingly driven by structural factors and the sectors that we work in as opposed to equal pay differentials
in specific comparable roles. However, we will continue to review our approach to pay and if there is any evidence of a gender
discrepancy we will immediately take corrective action.

Talent Pipeline
We have recently reviewed our talent and career development processes and have implemented measures to build diversity across our
workforce. This includes steps to review the gender representation in our succession plans, talent pools and management development
programmes – where we consider that there is not an appropriate gender balance we are reviewing and questioning this.

Recruitment and Selection
Our recruitment processes focus on attracting a diverse pool of candidates, we do this by ensuring that: (i) our recruitment marketing is
specifically reviewed to eliminate gender bias; and (ii) by monitoring our selection processes to detect and eliminate any conscious or
unconscious gender bias which may be present. We have recently conducted diversity and inclusion training for all our employees (and
provide this training to all new staff), this suite of training addresses all protected characteristics and includes specific examples around
gender discrimination in selection processes.

Family Friendly Policies
We have recently reviewed and re-launched our suite of family friendly policies. Our maternity and paternity policies for our management
and professional population now includes enhanced terms. We have a well embedded culture of flexible working in environments where
operational requirements permit this. In environments where operational constraints do significantly impact on the facility to undertake
flexible working, we will review applications sympathetically and make adjustments where possible.

Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan
In the course of the last 12 months we have established a Diversity and Inclusion Committee. The Committee has developed a broad
action plan to foster greater diversity and has articulated key KPIs and targets across our core people processes, specifically in the areas
of recruitment, selection, development, legal compliance and employee engagement (for example, we would expect to see a female
candidate shortlisted for all senior management roles, where this is not the case, this will be reviewed and questioned).
