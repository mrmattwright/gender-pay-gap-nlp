2017 Gender Pay Gap Reporting: UK

Recently, the UK introduced legislation requiring companies with more than 250 employees in Great Britain to report 
on their gender pay and bonus gap in that area.  

As we began our analysis in preparation for our own report, we realized that, as part of our commitment to reducing 
inequality,  we could be doing more.  The report results help illustrate where we see challenges. We must improve 
diversity and inclusion across our businesses. 

Pearson is a company with a social mission: to help people progress in their lives through learning.  That mission, along 
with our core values, is what defines us. We are committed to helping to reduce inequality, and value the unique skills, 
perspectives, and backgrounds of our employees. We want to ensure our environment is inclusive, to allow each 
individual to shine.  We have made the commitment to extend gender pay reporting globally by 2020.  

We value the unique skills, perspectives, and backgrounds of our employees.  The more diverse our people and 
inclusive our culture, then the better we can be at meeting the needs of our customers and learners around the world.

Gender Pay Gap Reporting UK

Pearson has five such statutory entities in the UK*  that fall within the 
scope of the legislation:

1. Pearson Education Limited
2. Pearson Management Services Limited
3. Pearson Professional Assessments Limited
4. Pearson Shared Services Limited
5. Pearson TQ Education and Training Limited

A summary of data covering all five entities is detailed in this report.  
Together, these entities employ approximately 4,000 employees, which is 
94% of the Pearson workforce in Great Britain.  A breakdown for each of 
these entities as well as a description for each company is attached as an 
appendix to this document.

*Pearson also has a growing presence in Northern Ireland, which is a global financial and accounting 
hub for the company.  The 115  people at that office are not covered by the regulations, which only 
apply in Great Britain, i.e. England, Scotland, and Wales.

Equal Pay vs. Gender Pay 
Reporting

Gender pay and equal pay are not the same.  Gender pay looks at the 
balance of men and women at each level of the organisation, by 
compensation.  Equal pay relates to men and women being paid the same 
for doing equal work.  Gender is not a factor in salary determination at 
Pearson.  We use a career framework model to determine a position grade 
level and salary.   

Gender pay shows the 
difference in total 
compensation of men and 
women in the organisation 
measured by hourly pay and 
bonus.  

For this report, the gap is influenced by 
the number of men and women within 
each of four pay bands (or quartiles) 
across the organization

Equal pay relates to men 
and women being paid the 
same base salary for doing 
equal work. 

Factors that do influence pay would 
include annual performance reviews 
and length of service.

Gender Pay Gap Reporting

The information required by the gender pay regulations
1. The average difference between salary and bonus for males and females over a 12-month period.  This is the 12 months up to 5  

April 2017.

2. The proportion of males and females receiving bonus pay
3. The proportion of males to females by quartile bands of pay level
Average Gender Pay and Bonus Gap for Pearson’s relevant entities for the 2017 time period
The difference between the pay and bonus pay of male employees and that of female employees is expressed as a percentage of 
the pay of male employees within the specified time period. The median and mean difference is reported. The smaller the number, 
the narrower the gap.

What is the median and mean? 
Median  When all of the values in a set are 
arranged in numerical order, the value in the 
exact middle is the median.  In the case of an 
even number of values, the average of the 
middle two values is the median.

Mean The mean is the average of a set of values, 
i.e. for gender pay, this is calculated by adding 
together all pay and dividing by the total number 
of employees.

Gender Pay Gap 
Results for Great Britain 
The median pay gap for the twelve-month period ending 5 April, 2017 at 
Pearson’s businesses in Great Britain was 15%. In comparison, the 
Office of National Statistics (ONS) median is reported at 18.8% for Great 
Britain employees (full-time and part-time). 

Analysis of the data shows that the gender pay gap at Pearson in Great 
Britain is primarily a result of having fewer women in senior level roles.

This pay and bonus gap data is based on hourly rates of pay. 
Bonuses reflect amounts paid in the year ending as of that date.

Career Framework
In 2016, Pearson introduced a career framework to provide consistency on how we assess and grade our people.  In addition 
to the Pearson Executive, we recognise eight standard job grades from the entry-level (A) to the senior leadership (H).  Within 
those standard job grades, we have:
● More women than men below Director level (E in our career framework)
● Fewer women than men at Director level and above

Gender Bonus Gap 
Results for Great Britain 

For the twelve-month period ending 5 April, 2017, the 
median bonus pay gap for Pearson’s businesses in 
Great Britain was 18%, and the mean was 52%. This is 
because there were fewer women in senior 
bonus-eligible roles during this time period.  In terms 
of eligibility, the proportion of men and women 
receiving a bonus was largely equal. 

This pattern could change year by year.

What does this mean for Pearson?

There is a huge opportunity here.  If we can understand why 
women are underrepresented in senior roles, we can tap 
into a broader pool of talent.   
 
We are already working  to understand how we can support 
women to realise their full potential and to progress into the 
most senior roles.  The gender pay data helps us 
understand the scale of the challenge. 

We are working hard to narrow the gap, push further with 
our commitment to diversity and inclusion, and develop 
a strong pipeline of diverse leaders. 

We will extend the 
collection of gender 
pay gap data from 
the UK to our 
global operations 
by 2020

Our Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion

We value the power of our differences. Our global Diversity & Inclusion 
programme aims to build a better, stronger company for our 
employees, our learners, and the communities we serve. 

We aspire to maintain a work environment that’s inclusive as well as 
diverse, in which our people can be themselves. And we’re building a 
culture of innovation and learning where every idea and perspective is 
valued.

More broadly, Pearson supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development as adopted by United Nations member states.  The 
agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals of which Goal 10 is 
to reduce inequalities within and among countries.   We are committed 
to promote equal opportunities for all.

Developing a Strong Pipeline of Diverse Leaders

The key question facing Pearson is how to support women to progress into our most senior roles.

Women in the succession pipeline

The Talent team is looking at how to make more high-level career progression opportunities 
available for women, and ensure that all leadership development programmes are as diverse as 
possible. 

As part of Pearson's commitment to understanding and addressing a range of issues of diversity, 
we commissioned a study with an external organisation to understand the challenges for women 
progressing to and beyond director level within our organisations in the UK. From this research, 
we will build interventions to address the challenges and help break down the barriers. 

In October 2017, we launched three new management and leadership programmes. All 
programmes will include a module on unconscious bias, and the participant groups will be 
gender-diverse.  

We do our best to ensure all open roles have a gender diverse talent pool through proactive 
market mapping and intelligence.  Agencies and search firms from January 2018 will be mandated 
via our contracts with them to present a gender-diverse slate.  We work with leaders, hiring 
managers, HR and external suppliers to ensure consistent assessment and selection activities.  
Our Talent Acquisition and HR Business Partner teams have participated in Unconscious Bias 
training to inform our internal and external recruiting processes.

Developing a Strong Pipeline of Diverse Leaders

Employee Resource Networks
Our Diversity & Inclusion team supports our employee resource groups (ERGs), including 
Women in Learning & Leadership (WILL). WILL currently engages more than 5,000 employees in 
17 chapters and five countries to help advance women at Pearson through career management, 
development and networking initiatives.  The UK chapter of WILL is the most active.

Cross-company mentoring and networking programme
We participate in the cross-company mentoring programme set up by the 30% Club aimed at 
supporting the development of talented mid-career women. It matches male and female leaders 
to mentor women from different organisations. In 2017/2018, Pearson will have had 10 mentees 
and 10 mentors participate, and we’ve previously had 28 people participate in mentoring 
cohorts. The programme includes monthly learning events that also provide a platform for 
building networks. In the long-term, the goal is to improve the number of women attaining 
senior leadership and board roles in their respective organisations.

Flexible workplace
Pearson offers all employees with 12 or more months service the opportunity to apply for a 
variety of flexible work arrangements.  We commit to providing options for working remotely, 
working from home, and other flexible working arrangements wherever possible.  As a result of 
our policy, we see an increasing diversity in working arrangements including field-based and 
home-based workers.

Narrowing the Gap

Increasing Diversity & Inclusion is a critical element of Pearson’s strategy.  Several initiatives are already in place to address 
our gender pay gap, and new activities are being developed as part of our 2018 Talent plan.  The gender pay gap data that is 
released each year going forward will be used to help assess our progress.

WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE UK
Inclusion Action Plan
In 2017, Pearson endorsed the Inclusion Action Plan launched by the Publishers Association, our 
industry trade body in the UK. The plan sets out ten commitments in relation to race as well as 
gender.  One aim of the plan is to see the UK industry report a gender balance in senior 
leadership roles by 2020. 

The 30% Club
Pearson is a founding member of the 30% Club, launched as a campaign in the UK in 2010 with 
a goal of achieving a minimum of 30% women on FTSE-100 boards. Currently, 27% of Pearson 
board members are female.  Since 2014, Pearson has largely met or exceeded the target and 
remains committed to it. This exceeds the 25% target for female Board representation to be 
achieved by 2015 set by Lord Davies at the launch of the 2011 Women on Boards Report

Narrowing the Gap

WHAT WE ARE DOING GLOBALLY
Driving our Talent Agenda 
The Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) team is a global resource within Human Resources’ Talent Centre of 
Expertise.  The team partners with Recruitment, Learning & Development and Talent Development to 
further our policy and programme development and implementation.  

Championed by the CEO, a new Pearson Executive Management Committee on Diversity was launched in 
October 2017.  This committee is charged with increasing D&I sponsorship, measurement, and investment 
across Pearson, and aim to communicate a new plan in 2018.  They will report progress regularly to the 
Remuneration and the Reputation and Responsibility Committees. 

Unconscious bias training 
Unconscious bias occurs when one group is favoured over another based on characteristics not related to 
ability. We are aiming to increase awareness of unconscious bias among our managers, and in our talent 
acquisition activities. Over the last 18 months, over 1,000 business leaders and managers — as well as HR 
business partners and recruiters — have completed unconscious bias training.  We are building out plans 
to increase our training in this area in 2018 for the UK and elsewhere, including incorporating modules into 
our management development programmes, such as Lead to Succeed and Manager Fundamentals.  

Gender intelligence training 
This workshop is designed to equip people to recognize the unique skills of both men and women to 
enhance collaboration and understanding across gender differences.  To date, 300 Pearson employees 
have attended Be Gender Intelligent workshops in 2017.  This workshop will be run with the Pearson 
Executive Management team in the first quarter of 2018.

● Pearson Education Limited (PEL) represents the 
education business in the UK covering Schools, 
Higher Ed, Qualifications, BTEC and 
Apprenticeships. 

● Whilst the pay gap is low compared to some of 
the other entities, its higher mean bonus gap is 
driven by the higher proportion of males in 
Director level and above roles which have 
corresponding higher bonus opportunities.

● TQ Education and Training Limited is a 
vocational training provider in the UK.

● Key driver in the pay gap is the fact there is a 

significantly higher proportion of males in 
senior roles, especially at Director level and 
above.

● In addition, there is a high proportion of males 

delivering our sports and outdoor education 
(climbing, hill walking, canoeing, etc.) activities.
