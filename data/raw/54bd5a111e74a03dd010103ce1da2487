It is now a legal requirement for all private and voluntary sector employers in England, Scotland and Wales, with 
250 or more employees, to calculate their gender pay and gender bonus gaps as they are on 5 April each year.  This 
report is based on pay data as at 5 April 2017 and the figures have been reached using the mechanisms that are set 
out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation.

The proportion of full-pay men and women in each of four quartile pay bands.

The above metrics do highlight a gap in the favour of females which is the opposite of the national picture. Our 
results are due to having a higher proportion of female staff especially in our retail division which are incentivised 
roles based on individual performance. Crucially the measures above do not take into account equal pay for equal 
work. It does not measure the pay difference between men and women at the same pay grade, doing the same job, 
with the same working pattern.

At DeMontfort we are committed to equal pay for similar roles at the same level and we are confident that we have a 
fair and consistent approach to paying individual employees. I can confirm that the data in this report is accurate.
