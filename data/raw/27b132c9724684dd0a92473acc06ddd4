Wasdell Packaging has a workforce exceeding this limit and as such we provide the context of the results and our approach to closing the underlying gap.    Pay Information & Gender Split  Mean hourly pay difference between male and female employees – 28%  Median hourly pay difference between male and female employees – 4%  Mean bonus pay gap – 92%  Proportion males/females receiving bonus payment – 7%/2%  Proportion males/females in each quartile:   Q1 (highest)	73%/27%  Q2		36%/64%  Q3		45%/55%  Q4		25%/75%   Analysis  Wasdell Packaging is committed to the principles of equal pay for all of our employees. Our current gender pay gap as at April 2017 was 28% (UK average 18.1% in 2016 per Office for National Statistics). However, the analysis of our gender gap figures tells us that this arises because women hold fewer positions within the upper quartile of the company and this distinction continues upwards within the upper quartile itself.  The reasons for this are complex and to a certain extent outside the control of the company. We have an open policy to recruitment from people of all gender but we do find that there is a significantly higher proportion of female staff that apply for positions in the second, third and fourth quartiles. There are longstanding societal patterns and perceptions that have led to certain occupations (eg nurses) being heavily dominated by one gender and this tends to be the case with contract packaging.  When the gender gap is recalculated for the just the second, third and fourth quartiles (ie removing quartile one) the gender pay gap is just 1%. Due to the breakdown of the male/female workforce the mean bonus pay gap is also heavily skewed and driven by fewer females in senior positions where bonuses are paid. Career progression within the company is not restricted by gender as the company promotes based on skills and experience.  As a company we are satisfied that all necessary steps are undertaken to ensure positions throughout the company are taken irrespective of gender.
