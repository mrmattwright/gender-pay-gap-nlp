SUFFOLK LIFE PENSIONS LIMITED
GENDER PAY GAP REPORT

APPROVED FOR INVESTOR USE | FEBRUARY 2018

This year, for the first time, all UK organisations with over 250 employees will publish their gender pay
gap data. This is a very important step forward because if companies are transparent about pay, and
identify the root causes of any pay gap, they can find solutions they need to build businesses that
reflect society.

Naturally we want to understand our pay gap and what is driving it so that we can create a culture that
attracts and retains the best people. We will continue to address any pay gap through good HR
practices and investigating the underlying reasons.

Suffolk Life has a positive approach to flexible working and employs a significant proportion of part
time employees. At 5 April 2017, 25% of our female and 1% of our male relevant employees chose to
work reduced hours. This does impact our mean bonus gap, as reduced hours staff receive a pro-rated
bonus to reflect the number of hours they work. If the bonus gap was calculated based on the bonus
these employees received if they worked full time, our overall mean bonus gap would reduce from
45.9% to 41.3%.

We are confident that both men and woman are paid equally for carrying out equivalent roles. We are
also confident that we have a fair and consistent bonus allocation process. However, there are
currently fewer women than men in senior roles which creates a gender pay gap and we are keen to
address this. We have recruitment and promotion processes in place which aim to ensure that we
attract diversity to the business and that all our staff have the same opportunities to progress within
the business. We will continue to work hard to develop all staff through one to one development,
structured training, support for external examinations and in-role development.

The table below shows the overall median and mean gender pay based on hourly rates of pay as at 5
April 2017 and also for bonuses paid in the year to 5 April 2017.
