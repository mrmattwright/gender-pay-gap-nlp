This gives us the opportunity to understand any gender imbalances in our workforce and develop initiatives to address our findings.  Gender Pay Gap Reporting is different from an equal pay comparison, which would involve a direct comparison of two people or groups of people carrying out the same, similar or equivalent work. We are confident that we offer equal pay for equal work across the business.
