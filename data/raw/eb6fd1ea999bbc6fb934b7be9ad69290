We are the No1 SAP value added reseller in the UK.  Our industry employs a predominantly male employee population and male employees outnumber females at every level in the organisation. Fewer women apply for our technical roles at an average ratio of 22% to 78%.  This drives a pool of male dominated talent and the gender pay gap.  An analysis of our mean gender pay gap of 27% shows that the gap exists because women hold fewer senior positions within the company than men. In the upper pay quartile there are 8.3% to 91.7% women to men respectively.  Our bonus gender pay gap of 74% is accounted for by the payment of sales commission to a sales team that is all male.                   Nevertheless we are committed to encouraging women to apply for all roles within itelligence, especially at senior levels. We have a variety of approaches for both women and men around flexible working, including working from home contracts, agreement to a 4 day working week and a purchase additional holiday scheme.                   A Women in Technology forum will be created in 2018 to support and mentor women through training and the promotion process and to ensure, wherever possible that more women are promoted into senior positions within the business. Our principle of appointment and promotion on merit remains in place whilst we offer support to our females to narrow the gender pay gap.  I confirm that our data has been calculated according to the requirements of The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
