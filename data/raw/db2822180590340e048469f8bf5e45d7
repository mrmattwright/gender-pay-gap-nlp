Under new legislation that came into force in April 2017, UK employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish their gender pay gap. Increasing gender pay gap transparency is a topic we’ve taken a leading and visible position on for some time.  For Sunrise and Gracewell this meant publishing gender pay data for two legal entities:   Gracewell Healthcare 1 Ltd (540 number of employees)  Gracewell Healthcare 3 Ltd (437 number of employees)   As these two legal entities are only part of the group, the Company is pleased to voluntarily report on the whole group of Sunrise Senior Living Ltd (UK) and Gracewell Healthcare.  Our aim is for everyone at Sunrise and Gracewell to be able to build and sustain a successful career.  We believe this requires an inclusive culture and an agile, flexible uniquely supportive community for our team members to operate in.
