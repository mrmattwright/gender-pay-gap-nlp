A key element of the survey is the ‘Employee Engagement Index’. This is a measure of how engaged employees are with their work and it is calculated from responses to five of the key questions in the people survey:   I am proud when I tell others I am part of The National Archives  I would recommend The National Archives as a great place to work  I feel a strong personal attachment to The National Archives  The National Archives inspires me to do the best in my job  The National Archives motivates me to help it achieve its objectives   Research in the private and public sector suggests organisations with high levels of engagement are more efficient and effective. The National Archives’ Employee Engagement Index was calculated at 66% this year. This classes The National Archives as a Civil Service High Performer.

It differs from equal pay, which is concerned with pay differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs, or work of equal value.  The document below provides a breakdown of this data.
