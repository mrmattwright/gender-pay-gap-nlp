Although we employ fewer than 250 people, we have chosen to publish our gender pay gap in line with our strong commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.  The gender pay gap is the difference in the hourly rate of pay of men and women, expressed as a percentage of men’s salary. It is separate from equal pay, which focuses on the pay differences between men and women performing the same or similar work, and which our pay policy, pay grading, and job evaluation system all protect against.  The statutory reporting asks for two separate figures based on two different ways of calculating averages: mean and median.  Key points for Greenpeace UK   Our gender pay gap across all employees is 8.3% (mean) and 3.0% (median)  This compares favourably to the UK national figures of 17.4% (mean) and 18.4% (median)  The two main reasons for our current gender pay gap are: i. Women made up 72% of our successful job applicants in both 2016 and 2017, compared to a long-term average of closer to 50%. External recruitment has been predominantly to lower grade positions, whereas senior vacancies are less common and more likely to be filled through internal promotion, contributing to a skew towards women in more junior posts. ii. The average length of service for our current male employees is about 1 year more than for female employees. One annual spine point increase is worth an average of around £1,300, or 3% of mean or median pay.  Women currently occupy at least 50% of posts at all senior levels of the organisation: grades 5, 6 and Directors.  We will continue to monitor this pay gap as part of our overall strategy for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.
