At the snapshot date of April 5th 2017, there were 237 employees in British Land and 322 employees in our subsidiary business Broadgate Estates.      The Real Estate Industry  Real Estate pay gap numbers reflect an industry wide picture. The sector has a legacy of employing more men than women particularly in higher paid senior roles. Many Real Estate companies are working hard to reverse this but it takes time as fewer female candidates have traditionally studied relevant courses in preparation for a role in the sector. To some extent the issue in Real Estate has therefore been an opportunity gap rather than a pay gap.  British Land is a leader in promoting change in this area and the company's Chief Executive, Chris Grigg, has campaigned for, and instigated transformation, since joining the company in 2009.  British Land  Our workforce is made up almost equally of men and women. We pay men and women who do the same jobs equally with each role benchmarked annually against external data and we are committed to reversing the traditional Real Estate gender imbalance through the promotion of an inclusive, performance driven culture. We have made significant progress over recent years.  In 2013 we were the founding supporter of 'Pathways to Property', a programme set up to encourage young people from a wide range of diverse backgrounds into the real estate sector, in conjunction with Reading University's Real Estate Foundation and the Sutton Group. In 2017 we welcomed a graduate trainee to British Land from the first cohort to complete this programme.  British Land was the first FTSE100 property company to achieve the National Equality Standard (August 2017). We are in the top 20% of FTSE 350 companies having at least 33% representation across our Executive Committee and their direct reports as reported in the Hampton Alexander Review. We also have a good pipeline of female managers in the middle quartile of our business who are progressing within the company.  We are one of a handful of FTSE100 companies who have announced the introduction of company enhanced shared parental pay in 2017 and we have introduced flexible working practices in many areas of the business, female mentoring programmes and maternity coaching.  We have a number of employee led networks promoting inclusivity including the Women's Network, The Pride Committee, Ethnic Diversity Network, Parent and Carers Nets and Wellbeing Committee. We are committed to increasing inclusion in all areas and our current representation in other groups is 9% of staff from an ethnic minority background, 25% who have spent some of their working life abroad and 5% who identify as LGBT. Our social mobility data shows that we have 55% of employees who were educated at a state school and 38% of employees who were the first in their families to attend University.  Our 2018 reported gap is also larger this year due to the final pay out of legacy long term incentive plans in 2017 as disclosure fell into the 2018 reporting period.
