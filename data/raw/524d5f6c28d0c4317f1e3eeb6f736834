We understand that raw data is not something that everyone is able to use and understand, so we will analyse and present some of the most important information and we will publish the data in a variety of formats so that businesses, local community groups and residents can re-use the data in new and innovative ways.  Data about the population of Sutton can be accessed through Data.Sutton . This website contains a vast amount of information and data about the borough and is regularly updated with the latest figures.  Data about council spending and data we are required to publish under the local government transparency code can be accessed through the Council’s Publication Scheme . By publishing the data through this scheme we hope to improve the level of information and data that residents are able to access.
