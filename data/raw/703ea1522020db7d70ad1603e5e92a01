We do have a gender pay gap at Imperial, and we do not consider this acceptable.  “We are committed to addressing this imbalance by tackling barriers to progression through providing personalised development, rolling out unconscious bias training, and further developing our award-winning family friendly initiatives. In terms of recruitment, we introduced a ‘Know Your Pool’ initiative to identify appropriately qualified women and encourage their application for roles at all levels. We are also seeking to tackle the gender imbalance in STEM generally through outreach work with schools.  “Our activity on gender sits as part of our wider equality work, now led by Professor Stephen Curry – our new Assistant Provost for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion. We are determined to enhance the working environment to make Imperial a better place to work for all our staff."  Professor James Stirling Provost  What is the gender pay gap?  Like all other large organisations Imperial has published details of its gender pay gap. This shows that the gap between the median hourly pay of men and women at Imperial is 9.4 per cent.  The gender pay gap isn’t the same as equal pay – Imperial rightly pays men and women the same for work of equal value. Doing so has been a legal requirement since 1970.  If men and women are paid the same for the same jobs why do we have a gender pay gap?  The main reason for our gender pay gap is that we have more men than women in our senior, more well-paid roles. The lower three quartiles have nearly a 50-50 split between men and women, but the top quartile is 70.1% men and 29.9% women.  How do we compare?  Our gender pay gap is broadly in line with the national average. While we have a slightly bigger gap than the higher education sector as a whole, compared to other research-intensive universities in the Russell Group we actually have a smaller gap.  What are the figures we’ve reported?  Like all other large organisations, Imperial has reported data across a number of different elements: quartiles, mean and median gender pay gap, and gender pay gap in bonuses. You can access the data below.    quartiles and mean/median         Quartiles  Imperial's quartiles - the number of men and women at different pay levels               Mean and median  Imperial's mean and median gender pay gap           Bonuses and initiatives         Bonuses  Imperial's gender pay gap in bonuses               Initiatives and projects  Imperial has a range of initiatives and projects in place to address the imbalance.
