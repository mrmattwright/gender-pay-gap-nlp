This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employees data.  We can use these results to assess:   the levels of gender equality in our workplace  the balance of male and female employees at different levels  how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.   The challenge in our organisiation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.   Please find below the report for download.
