The figures set out below have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  At the Big Lottery Fund we are committed to advancing equalities and celebrating the diversity of communities across the UK.  We are committed to equal opportunities and equal treatment of all employees. We regularly review how we can improve this for current and future employees.  As of 31 March 2017, there were 836 full time equivalent employees at the Big Lottery Fund. Our mean pay gap is 3.2% and our median pay gap is non-existent (women’s median pay is 0.2% higher than men’s).  Please note that the gender pay gap is different from equal pay, which refers to paying men and women equally for the same or equivalent work.   The Big Lottery Fund views these figures as a positive outcome. These results compare favourably to the Civil Service pay gap of 11.0% mean and 12.7% median.  Bonus gender pay gap  In 2016, 208 employees received a bonus - 139 women and 69 men. This represents 24% of all females and 22% of all males in the Fund. The mean gender bonus gap is 2.7% and the median gender bonus gap is 0%.  Pay quartiles  The following table demonstrates the gender distribution across the Big Lottery Fund. The first quartile contains employees on the lowest rates of pay and the fourth (upper) quartile contains employees on the highest rates of pay.   Quartile by salary    Female    Male    First (lower quartile)    63%    37%    Second quartile    67%    33%    Third quartile    69%    31%    Fourth (upper quartile)    61%    39%   We take the issue of equality seriously, as demonstrated by these figures. We actively seek to achieve a diverse workforce and report on this data in our annual report (PDF).  We are however not complacent, and to maintain gender diversity we will:  Continue to monitor our advertising and recruitment Monitor our internal promotion and progression opportunities Support flexible working and job evaluation policies         Big Lottery Fund  1 Plough Place, London EC4A 1DE  general.enquiries@biglotteryfund.org.uk  0345 4 10 20 30    Quick links   Freedom of Information  Tender opportunities  Corporate documents  Privacy Policy  Terms  Contact  Jobs  Cookies  Site map  Accessibility           Home    Funding    Research    About    Cymraeg            Search            <% survey.question %>           Closes an overlaid panel when clicked      Thank you for sharing your feedback with us - we appreciate your time.
