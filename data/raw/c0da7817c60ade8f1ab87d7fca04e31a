As one of the world’s leading professional services companies for the digital era, we are proud to be an employer with a strong focus on providing an outstanding work environment, developing and nurturing talent and continuously optimising employment practices. We have been certified as a Top Employer in the U.K. for the last 4 years. Cognizant has ranked #7 in the world on Fortune magazine’s annual World’s Most Admired Companies list. We also appear on the Thomson Reuters’ 2018 Top 100 Global Tech Leaders list. Cognizant is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation as a Living Wage Employer.  In addition to workforce diversity, we ensure that our culture is inclusive, open, collaborative and respectful. Our Women Empowered programme, for example, promotes and celebrates female role models in Cognizant by providing educational and networking opportunities for its members.  As Cognizant U.K. has over 250 employees, it is required to comply with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. We welcome the opportunity to report our gender pay gap under the new reporting regulations.  The gender pay gap is the difference between the average mean and median earnings (hourly pay, as well as bonus pay-out) of all men and women across the organisation. The mean and median hourly rate of pay for men and for women is calculated in relation to all employees, regardless of level and whether full or part time. This is not to be confused with equal pay, which means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work must receive equal pay.  Our median gender pay gap of 11.6% is less than the U.K. average (median) gender pay gap of 18.4% and the U.K. average of 25% in the technology sector. However, we still have more work ahead of us. We are targeting 20% of our new senior hires to be female to address the gap, and have also identified a number of areas to be addressed, with the expectation that these actions will help close the gender pay gap in the coming years.
