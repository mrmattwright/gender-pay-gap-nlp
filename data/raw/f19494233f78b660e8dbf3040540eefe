Brightwork has it as central to its purpose to ensure that all employees/workers are rewarded fairly for their work and enjoy equal access to all opportunities. Ensuring we encourage career progression for all colleagues in our business, regardless of gender, has always been, and remains at the heart of our leadership team’s agenda. Our employees and candidates are important to us and play a vital role in support of our purpose to help people be the best version of themselves. We remain committed to attracting and retaining the very best talent to our business and ensuring that gender is never a factor in our decision making.  Having carried out a review of our gender pay gap, relative to national statistics, our gender pay gap is significantly below the average.  The current national gender pay gap is 18.1%; Brightwork’s gender pay gap is 7.7%. Whilst we are encouraged by this result, we are not complacent and are committed to addressing any differentials to ensure that everyone is given the opportunity to contribute fully to making Brightwork a great place to work.  Gender Pay Statistics  The gender pay gap measures the difference between men and women’s average earnings per hour and is expressed as a percentage of men’s pay.     These results are affected by over 95% of employees being contractors. The mean and median Gender Pay Gap is only 7.7% and 11% respectively. All are paid the same hourly rate, irrespective of gender. However, the gap is explained by those involved in the higher paid Drinks sector being predominantly male.    Bonus Payments  Brightwork’s mean gender bonus gap is -188.1%. This is a reflection of the fact that there are currently more female colleagues than male colleagues in senior roles within Brightwork. This information is tangible evidence that our commitment to promotion on merit is bearing fruit.  Bridging the Gap  Brightwork cultivates talent regardless of their gender, background or education. However, we are not complacent and there is still more we can do to help reduce the gender pay gap across our business. For roles that are predominately carried out by males we need to focus on making it an attractive role for women to undertake. We also need to continue to focus on our female talent pipeline for more senior roles and ensuring that we continue to offer offering flexibility at all career levels.
