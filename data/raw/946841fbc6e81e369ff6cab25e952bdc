We welcome the new Gender Pay Reportng Regulations, and have prepared our first Gender Pay Report in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Informaon) Regulations 2017 which shows: - A mean gender pay gap of 6.1%, compared to a UK average of 18.1% - A median gender pay gap of 3.25% - A mean bonus  gender pay gap of 19.7% - A median bonus  gender pay gap of 0% - A bonus payment was received by 98.4% of females and 97.9% of males - Below are the quartile figures showing the percentage of each gender in     each quartile pay band:    DECLARATION  I hereby confirm that the information provided in this report is accurate Gordon McGhee Group Managing Director  BACKGROUND  McGhees has been a family bakery since 1935, and since then has grown to become one of the largest independently owned bakers and wholesalers of bakery and morning goods in Scotland. Throughout our history, and never more so than today, our success is dependent upon the quality of our staff, and cultivating an environment of being part of the McGhee family. We have many employees with more than 10 years service, and this historical position, along with the nature of traditionally male dominated manufacturing and driving roles, has resulted in 79% of the total workforce being male, with 21% female.  The long standing nature of these employees has contributed to the mean gender pay gap that we see today, which we recognise and endeavour to improve upon. While equal pay is a different issue from the wider concept of gender mix throughout an organisation, McGhee’s employees doing the same job, with the same responsibilities, are paid the same, irrespective of gender or ethnicity.
