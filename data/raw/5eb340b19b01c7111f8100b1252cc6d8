Both organisations have a strong record of serving our clients by harnessing the best talent from around the world. At DXC, we recognise that our success is founded on continuing to ensure we hire, promote and reward employees based on capability, irrespective of their gender, religion, sexual orientation or ethnic origin.  In the UK, the government has introduced gender pay gap reporting legislation, which means that all companies with more than 250 employees must report their gender pay gap statistics annually. The method of reporting these statistics is set down by law, and this is the first year in which companies have been required to report.  The technology industry as a whole shows a gender pay gap greater than the average for all companies in the UK: The UK average mean gender pay gap is 18 per cent, the technology sector is nearer 25 per cent.  As a company, we welcome the focus that this legislation brings to the continued pay gap in society between men and women. At the same time, it is important to understand what the statistics mean.  The statistics provide a view of the gender balance within an organisation at a particular point in time. They measure the difference between the average earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of their roles and experience.  As we work towards addressing the imbalance shown in the statistics, we also continue to consciously dismantle some of the historical reasons behind it, overcoming challenges in recruiting, retaining and developing women for leadership roles.  DXC recognises its responsibility to hire, promote and nurture our employees from all backgrounds and genders. At DXC, our gender pay gap reflects the industry-wide trend, and detailed analysis of our own data clearly indicates that the gender pay gap at DXC is a consequence of not only a majority of our employees being male, but also the higher proportion of male employees in the company’s upper management. This is an imbalance that the company is striving to overcome and is a primary priority of our people agenda.   Our summarised statistics are outlined below, covering all DXC UK employing companies combined. Please click here for a breakdown by company.    Mean gender pay gap 1    Median gender pay gap 2   25%  26%   We continue the work of addressing this imbalance and are making progress. Some of the activities DXC has worked on or is working on to address this include:   In 2016, in our Xchanging business unit, a development programme was piloted in combination with our training partner Skillsoft to develop future female leaders. DXC is exploring how this programme can be supported and enhanced in 2018 to continue this process of development.  Due to the high number of DXC employees based in Scotland and the North of England (Chorley, Newcastle and Erskine) it has been actively engaged in the Northern Power Women Awards programme. DXC will continue to support this valuable programme recognising women in leadership.  DXC actively encourages women at the start of their careers through our STEM Ambassador volunteer programme. Volunteers have attended “Monster Confidence” events in 2016 and 2017 helping over 800 female students with mock interviews, mentoring, career path planning and CV writing.  DXC actively reviews diversity data when considering retention initiatives and reward programmes to address attrition from female colleagues who have the potential to move upwards in the organisation.  DXC has a global Women in Leadership Employee Resource Group that offers training and mentoring for women aspiring to leadership roles.     A statement from our leadership  DXC is proud to leverage its diversity and provide outstanding transformational support and value for our clients.  Our global mission is to challenge every component of our human resources strategy and ensure that we harness the best talent from every part of our diverse community. Our primary internal focus continues to be ensuring we provide opportunities for all our employees to develop their talents in order that we may better serve our clients and advance the company as a whole.  We are committed to ensuring diversity at every level of our organisation. Click here to read a statement on diversity from our chairman, president and CEO, Mike Lawrie .  In publishing these results, we acknowledge that like other organisations in our industry we have a challenge ahead of us that will require great persistence and urgency in our actions. Our ongoing efforts in ensuring the right changes are made reinforce our ambition to grow DXC in the UK and globally, and continue to live up to our own high standards of diversity and inclusion.  Jo Mason , Chief Human Resources Officer, DXC   Nick Wilson , Senior Vice President and General Manager, DXC UK Ireland & Israel    In action: DXC’s commitment to developing women for leadership and senior technical roles   “I joined DXC Technology through the graduate programme in 2015. Growing up surrounded by digital technology has allowed me to thrive off fast-paced change. It’s exciting and the uncertainty is what I love about the industry.  “I have been fortunate throughout my time at DXC to have met some amazing people who have inspired and encouraged me to continuously develop myself and my learning. Being a member of two internal employee resource groups has facilitated me to always strive for more in what I do and it has made a huge contribution to developing my own goals and career aspirations.  “I have learnt that only you can make change happen for yourself, it’s all about your own mind-set. Work hard, take the chances and be authentic along the way.  “One female mentor I met along my journey once told me to always ‘Feel the fear and do it anyway’ – and my success on the graduate programme is a result of living and breathing this quote!”  Philippa Ryan , Associate Professional System Analyst   The mean pay gap states the difference between the average hourly earnings of our male and female employees, measured at April 2017.  The median pay gap states the difference between men and women’s hourly earnings value when taking the mid-point of each, measuring earnings at April 2017.
