2017 Report

Gender Pay Gap Report
Introduction

In 2017 the UK Government introduced the requirement for companies with more 
than 250 employees in Great Britain, to calculate and report on their gender pay gap 
for salary and bonuses on an annual basis. 

This report is in compliance with The Equality 
Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017. The calculations are a 
standard across all companies. The data 
does not consider the differing levels within 
the organisation and does not make a 
split between technical and non-technical 
employees.  

Penspen’s current Pay Gap including 
contractors is 17.4% mean and 15.5% median, 
and when looking at our permanent workforce, 
our Mean Gap is 16.7% and Median 19.7%

Penspen’s permanent workforce is 21% 
female, with only 14% of senior or technical 
roles being carried out by women. This is one 
of the principal reasons behind Penspen’s 
gender pay gap. 

Penspen is committed to increasing the 
representation of women across the workforce 
and developing our female talent, however 
within the Energy Industry there is a smaller 
representation of women than men (approx. 
20% of the available talent pool). With the 
added focus of STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics) training and 
education we are starting to see a small 
change in the numbers of women available in 
the talent pool. However this will take time to 
address. 

Penspen is committed to achieving equality 
across all elements of diversity, not just 
focussing on one segment. However due to the 
nature of the available and qualified workforce 
this will take time to address. 

I confirm that the information and data provided is accurate and in line with mandatory 
requirements.

Mean and Median: 
The gender pay gap shows the difference 
between the mean [average] and the median 
[mid-point] pay and bonus earnings of male 
and female employees, expressed as a 
percentage of male employee’s earnings.

Proportion of males and females 
receiving bonus:
The proportion of male to female employees 
who were paid any amount of bonus pay.

Proportion of males and females in 
each pay quartile band:
The proportion of male and female employees 
in four quartile hourly rate pay bands ranked 
from lowest hourly rate to the highest hourly 
rate. Each quartile band has the same number 
of employees.

Penspen Gender Pay Gap 
Data

The calculations are based only on our UK employee numbers, and the 
concept of Gender Pay Gap should not be confused with Equal Pay.  

Equal Pay is where regardless of Gender you are paid the same for the 
same job.  Penspen operates an equal pay policy and has over the last 4 
years introduced measures to address previous imbalances. Globally, we 
are confident we have equal pay for equal roles within the local markets 
that each of our employees operate in.

Penspen’s pay gap is due to the distribution of men and women, as we 
have more men in senior technical and managerial roles. This is something 
that is a work in progress and to get to a balance will take some time 
to address. Penspen is committed to continue to work with embracing 
opportunity regardless of the diversity of candidates. 

Our bonus calculation is distorted due to the relatively small number of 
women who received a bonus. This is coupled with some smaller bonus 
elements awarded as spot awards which distort the figures as the 
only women who received a bonus were at more senior level within the 
organisation. 

Penspen is committed to improving its Gender Pay Gap and will continue 
to invest in partnerships to enable a greater gender balance within the 
industry.
