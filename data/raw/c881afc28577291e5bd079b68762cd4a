Gender Pay  
Gap Reporting

The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings 
of men and women. Gender pay gap reporting requires employers annually from 5 April 2017 with 
250  or  more  employees  to  publish  the  differences  in  the  average  pay  of  men  and  women  over  a 
standard time period, regardless of occupation, role, seniority, location and any other employment 
circumstances. The gender pay gap differs from equal pay that deals with the pay differences between 
men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. 

We are confident that men and women are paid equally for 

doing equivalent jobs at Albert Goodman.

AS part of the regulations, THE FOLLOWING MUST BE REPORTED:

  mean gender pay gap
  median gender pay gap
  mean bonus gender pay gap
  median bonus gender pay gap

  proportion of men receiving a bonus payment
  proportion of women receiving a bonus payment
  proportion of men and women in each quartile pay band

THE gender distribution ACROSS FOUR EQUALLY SIZED QUARTILES IS:

50%

50%

12%

88%

34%

39%

66%

61%

QUARTILE 1 QUARTILE 2

QUARTILE 3 QUARTILE 4

In the lowest 25% pay quartile (quartile 1) there is an equal split of genders on average pay. In the second quartile 
there are 88% women compared to 12% men and in the third quartile 66% women compared to 34% men. Our final 
quartile contains our senior members of staff of which 35 are men and 18 are women contributing to a 61% / 39% 
split. Reflecting the position that there are more men in senior, higher paid roles within the business, the 
average pay for men is higher than the average pay for women giving a mean gender pay gap of 21% and 
a median gender pay gap of 22%.

Christmas bonus payments of equal value  are  paid  to  all  members  of  staff  who  have  completed  at  least 
1  years’  service.  We  also  have  schemes  available  to  staff  where  additional  payments  are  made,  for  example  for 
introducing new employees to the firm. 
There was no median bonus gap (i.e.0%) however there was a mean bonus gap of 61%.  We are confident 
that men and women have an equal opportunity to participate in our bonus schemes.

The  firm  is  committed  to  pay 
equality  and  providing  support 
for all individuals, irrespective of 
their gender, to build and sustain 
a  successful  career.    We  offer 
flexible  working  options  as  part 
of our commitment to developing 
an inclusive culture.

82% of women were paid a bonus compared to 75% of men. 

I confirm Albert Goodman LLP Gender Pay Gap Calculations 
are accurate and meet the requirement of the regulations.
