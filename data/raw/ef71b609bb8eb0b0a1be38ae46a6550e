UK gender pay  
reporting 2017

Message from Tim Robinson,  
Chief Executive Officer, LGC

It is crucial to me that we foster an inclusive 
and diverse environment, where each and 
every one of our employees knows they can 
fulfil their potential by developing and growing 
their career, regardless of their gender, whilst 
contributing to our vision of Science for a Safer 
World.

We welcome the Gender Pay Reporting under 
the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Information) 
Regulations 2017, under UK legislation, as it 
provides us with the opportunity to share our 
gender pay data openly, explain the reasons for 
gaps and discuss steps we are putting in place 
to address them. 

It is important to differentiate gender pay 
gap and equal pay. The UK Department for 
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy 
explains that “The gender pay gap shows the 
difference in the average pay between all men 
and women in a workforce”. 

We are required to publish the following data, 
about our UK workforce:

•  mean and median gender hourly pay  

rate gaps

•  mean and median gender bonus gaps
• 

the proportion of men and women who  
received bonuses
the proportion of men and women 
employees in each pay quartile

• 

Equal pay is the right for men and women 
to be paid the same when doing the same, 
or equivalent, work.  All LGC positions are 
benchmarked internally and externally to ensure 
consistency of pay across the Group. We will 
continue to ensure that there is consistency of 
pay across the whole Group, irrespective  
of gender.

LGC’s gender pay data 

 

The following gender pay data 
is based on LGC’s UK employee 
data from 5 April 2017.

57%

57% of LGC’s UK employees are women, which is a greater 
representation than the average in scientific professions 
(Wise campaign 2017- Women in STEM workforce report).

Why does LGC have 
a gender pay gap?

 As gender pay gaps are based on averages taken across the whole 
organisation, they do not take into account factors such as job type 
or different levels of seniority. We have reviewed our gender pay gap 
numbers carefully and there are more women than men in three of the 
four pay quartiles however there are more men in the top quartile. This is 
the main reason for our gender pay gap, and this is very much in line with 
the majority of UK companies. The demographics of our population are 
shown in the pay quartiles graphic.

We are putting in place actions to support a more diverse organisation,  
at all levels of the Group.

How we plan to foster greater diversity at LGC

Initial analysis indicates that the gender pay gaps we are observing stem 
from a diversity imbalance in the senior roles – where we have increased 
our female population, but clearly not by enough. However, we need to 
better understand what the issues are and how we can target our efforts to 
address them.

We will continue our commitment to equal pay. We will continue to 
develop initiatives and review our existing programmes and policies to 
improve diversity, including representation at senior levels and enable 
all employees to fulfil their potential and achieve their career aspirations 
regardless of gender, race, sexuality etc.

I confirm that this report and its data are accurate. 

Tim Robinson
Chief Executive Officer

We recognise that fostering greater diversity will take time. We will conduct 
a thorough review of the data to identify where the challenges are, the 
reasons for this and how we can best target new initiatives to improve 
gender balance. 

Alongside this, we will continue to focus on ensuring there is no bias in the 
hiring, promotion, development and retention of employees. LGC has an 
annual global talent review process and we regularly review succession 
plans to ensure that we have diverse internal pipelines. We have a robust 
and consistent personal performance and development review process 
which encourages colleagues to discuss their career aspirations and plan 
their personal development. We will also continue our STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Maths) activities to engage the younger 
generations and grow our future pool of talent.

We also have a policy of flexible working arrangements for our UK 
employees which supports colleagues in all stages of their lives in 
achieving their desired work and life balance, helping them with 
parenthood, studies, caring and hobbies.
