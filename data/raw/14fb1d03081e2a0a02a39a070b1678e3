The information is published on the Gov.com website.  The Gender Pay Gap looks at the difference in the average pay of men and women in an organisation. This is important to us as we are committed to diversity and inclusion and aim to be a great employer.  Here at Origin   48%  of our colleagues are male  52% of our colleagues are female   Our mean gender pay gap is   4.1%  Which means the mean average hourly rate for women is 4.1% lower than for men. When comparing mean hourly rates, women earn 96p for every £1 that men earn.  The mean is our average pay. This is calculated by adding up all our salaries and dividing by the number of colleagues.  Our median gender pay gap is -1.6%  Which means that women are paid slightly more than men. When comparing median hourly rates, women earn £1.02 for every £1 that men earn.  The median is the middle value in our pay. This value is calculated by organising all of our salaries in order and picking the middle number.  Origin’s mean gender pay gap is low and considerably less than the national gender pay gap. The mean UK gender pay gap in 2017 was 18.4%.    Our pay bands  We have 48% % male and 52% female colleagues. They are spread across the pay bands, which for our reporting are split across four quartiles: this is where all the salaries – men and women – are sorted by size and divided into equal quarters.  We have to publish the percentage of men and women in each quarter:     The upper quartile - the highest paid 25% - 57% men and 43% women  The upper middle quartile – the next 25% - 37% men and 63% women  The lower middle quartile – the next 25% - 51% men and 49% women  The lower quartile - the lowest paid 25% - 46% men and 54% women   This shows we have more men in the highest paid quartile of jobs and more women in the lowest paid quartile.    Explaining our pay  We have a good track record of having a balance of male and female colleagues at a senior level.  The slightly higher percentage of men we have in the top quarter of salaries is partly due to some of our more technical teams having more male colleagues than female colleagues.  The lowest quarter of salaries includes many of our colleagues in Care and Support where we have more women than men.    Bonus pay  We have reported bonus pay paid from 6 April 2016 to 5 April 2017.  54.3% of men and 53.9% of women received bonus pay   The mean bonus for male colleagues that were paid a bonus was £234.50.  The mean bonus pay of female colleagues that were paid bonus pay was £241.35.    Women’s mean bonus pay was 2.9% higher than men’s.  Women’s median bonus pay was 0% lower than men’s.     Explaining our bonus pay  In 2016-17 we did not make a consolidated pay increase except to those on the Real Living Wage. Most colleagues were paid a bonus of £200. A small number of colleagues received a bonus related to acting up into more senior roles and covering additional duties.    What action are we taking on our gender pay gap  We are proud that our gender pay gap is low but we aren’t complacent and we will be continuing to make sure that:   We provide training and support to managers to ensure that fair, non-discriminatory and consistent recruitment processes are followed.  We are recruiting from a wide and representative pool of people for all roles.  We continue to support a wide range of flexible working arrangements which are seen very positively by our people.  We make sure that there is fair access to career and talent development opportunities.  We continue our commitment to paying the Real Living Wage (which is higher than the National Living Wage and colleagues in London receive the London Living Wage.
