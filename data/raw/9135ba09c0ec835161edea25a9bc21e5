Each year, we receive a grant from the University of Kent to help fund what we do. This is particularly important for our services that do not make money, such as our Advice Centre, campaigning work and academic representation. We also run a number of services that make money, such as our Venue nightclub and Essentials shops. Our main reason for running these services is to provide Kent students with valuable job opportunities on campus, helping them build their skills and experience for their CV which will help them succeed in the competitive job market. These services also make a surplus, which we use to fund other areas of the Union.  All the money we receive goes into providing the services we run for students including Sports clubs, societies, volunteering, events and campaigning. Each year, we find demand for our services increases, particularly our Advice Centre – last year our Advisors dealt with over 5,000 student cases!        In 2016/2017 we raised £11,999,586     In 2016/2017 we spent £11,999,586         How do you set your prices in Essentials?  In order to fund all the activities we provide for students, it’s important that our services make a profit. In Essentials, and in The Venue, we need to pay for student staff wages, insurance, credit card charges, rent and lots of other overheads. Our main reason for running our services is to offer as many job opportunities to students as we possibly can, rather than hiring permanent career staff.  As we are part of NUS, many of our products are purchased through them which enables us to negotiate discounts and offers. We are constantly reviewing our prices and seeing how we can offer better value for money.    If you’re a charity, why do you need to make a surplus each year?  We are legally obligated to have reserves in the bank. This is important to ensure we are able to protect our future activities and remain in a good financial position. The money we have in the bank enables us to pay our creditors. Many businesses fail because they run out of cash. Our Board of Trustees is responsible for ensuring they look after the future of Kent Union, which is why we monitor our finances regularly.
