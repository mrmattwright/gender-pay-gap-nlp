 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 105.
 Adjusted basic EPS is calculated as profit for the Period excluding exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, adjusted for tax and divided by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue for the Period.
 When reviewing performance the Directors use a combination of both statutory and adjusted performance measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS, as they 
provide additional information in line with how financial performance is measured by Management and reported to the Board.

4  Profit for the year includes £27.6 million (FY16: £15.7 million) of exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisitions (adjusted for tax) recognised during the Period.

Chairman’s statement

Another 

transformative year 

for ZPG

The past year has been another 

transformative one for ZPG and, on behalf 
of the Board, I am pleased to present the 

Company’s results for the year ended 

30 September 2017.

Mike Evans,  
Chairman

Dear Shareholders
We have expanded considerably over 
the past 12 months as a result of strong 
underlying growth and the announcement 
of five new acquisitions and two new 
strategic partnerships.
We saw strong performance in our Property 
division, driven by a continuation of returning 
portal partners, strong demand for our 
upsell products and further migration of our 
software partners to cloud-based products. 
Our Comparison division also traded well, 
reaching a new milestone of over 1 million 
energy switches in a 12 month period and 
saving consumers over £400 million off 
their household bills over that period.

Financial performance
Total revenue increased by 24% to 
£244.5 million driven by a strong underlying 
performance across both divisions together 
with the inclusion of acquisitions during 
the Period. 
Statutory profit for the year was up 2% to 
£37.4 million after the impact of increased 
exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible 
assets arising from acquisitions and 
share-based payments. Statutory basic 
EPS marginally decreased at 8.8 pence 
as a result of a 5% equity placing of ZPG’s 
ordinary issued share capital in January to 
help fund strategic acquisitions.

06 

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

The Board uses a combination of both 
statutory and adjusted performance measures 
when reviewing the performance of the 
business. The adjusted performance measures, 
including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted 
basic EPS, provide additional information 
in line with how financial performance is 
measured by Management and reported 
to the Board. Both of these measures are 
also used in determining the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and Management 
and are used by the Company’s external debt 
providers to assess performance against 
covenants and determine the interest charge. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 25% to 
£96.4 million (2016: £77.1 million), and 
adjusted EPS increased by 20% to 
15.2 pence (2016: 12.7 pence).
During the year we increased our overall 
credit facilities by £125 million including 
updated leverage covenants in order to help 
fund our acquisitions. ZPG remains highly 
cash generative and as at 30 September 2017 
the Company’s net debt position was 
£191.5 million (2016: £146.3 million).

Acquisitions
We continued our strong track record 
of successful M&A activity to help deliver 
our mission:
•  In November 2016, we acquired 

TechnicWeb, one of the UK’s leading 
estate agency website design and 
hosting businesses.

•  In January 2017, we acquired Hometrack, 
the UK’s leading provider of residential 
property market insights and analytics.

•  In March 2017, we acquired ExpertAgent, 
one of the UK’s leading cloud-based estate 
agent software solutions.

•  In September 2017, we acquired 

Ravensworth, the UK’s leading provider of 
on-demand print and creative marketing 
services to UK estate and letting agents. 

•  On 1 October 2017, following the end 
of the Period, we acquired Money, one 
of the UK’s leading financial services 
comparison websites. 

“ It has been an exceptionally busy 
and exciting year for us. Looking 
ahead, we will continue to focus 
on the execution of our key 
strategies and to drive 
shareholder value.”

These acquisitions are all part of the 
Company’s continuing mission to be the 
platform of choice for consumers and partners 
engaged in property and household decisions. 
They also further increase the number of 
partners that we work with and enhance the 
Company’s comprehensive product offering 
for both our consumers and partners.

Dividend
The Company’s dividend policy is to pay 
between 35% and 45% of profit after tax 
in dividends to shareholders. In line with 
our dividend policy, the Board has proposed 
a final dividend of 3.8 pence per share to 
be paid in respect of the year ended 
30 September 2017.
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), this will be 
paid on 8 February 2018 to all shareholders 
on the share register as at 8 December 2017. 
An interim dividend of 1.9 pence per share 
(2016: 1.5 pence per share) was paid in 
June 2017. Therefore, the total dividend for 
the year ended 30 September 2017 will be 
5.7 pence per share (2016: 5.2 pence per share), 
which represents a 40.4% pay-out ratio.

Governance
There is an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge 
of ZPG within the Board. This means that 
the Board is able to discharge its duties 
and responsibilities effectively and can 
direct and lead the strategic direction 
of the Company. The Board is committed 
to compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and full details of the 
work of the Board and its Committees 
during the year are set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report.

Board update
During the year, the Board reassessed 
Grenville Turner’s independence and it was 
agreed that since Grenville stepped down 
as the Chairman of Countrywide Plc, a 
customer and previously a major shareholder 
in ZPG, in April 2016 and since Countrywide 
ceased to be a shareholder of the Company 
from September 2016 onwards, Grenville would 
be considered independent for the purposes 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
from the conclusion of the Board meeting 
in July 2017 onwards. Further details of 
the Board’s determination of Grenville’s 
independence are set out on page 52. 
Therefore, at least half of the Board now 
comprises Non-Executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent. 
Biographies of all members of the Board 
appear on pages 50 and 51.

In January 2017, Stephen Daintith stepped 
down as a Non-Executive Director nominated 
by DMGT pursuant to its relationship 
agreement with the Company, entered into 
at the time of the Company’s initial public 
offering. James Welsh was nominated by 
DMGT to replace Stephen. James acts as 
an observer on the Audit Committee and 
the Remuneration Committee. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank Stephen 
for his hard work and significant contributions 
to the Company and welcome James to 
the Board.

Capital structure
In February 2017, 20,897,684 new Ordinary 
shares in the Company were placed at a 
price of 365 pence per share to help fund 
M&A activity. The placing was heavily 
oversubscribed and has helped to increase 
the breadth of our institutional ownership. 
The Company currently holds 135,317 shares 
in treasury.
DMGZ Limited remains the largest single 
shareholder in the Company with a holding 
of 29.8%. Alex Chesterman, Founder & Chief 
Executive Officer, holds 0.97%. The number 
of shares held by institutional shareholders 
has increased from 64.3% to 68.8% over 
the past 12 months. The Company continues 
to build up a register of respected 
institutional shareholders.

Annual General Meeting
The Company’s next AGM will be held on 
30 January 2018. The resolutions at the AGM 
will be conducted on a poll, as we believe 
that this method is the most inclusive, enabling 
the views of the widest number of shareholders 
to be taken into consideration. The AGM is 
a great opportunity to meet the Board and I 
would like to encourage our shareholders to 
attend. I will be at the AGM, along with the 
other members of the Board, and look 
forward to seeing some of you there.
It has been an exceptionally busy and 
exciting year for us. Looking ahead, we will 
continue to focus on the execution of our 
key strategies and to drive shareholder value. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
everyone in the Company for their contribution 
and commitment over this past year.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement 

and business review

We are stronger 

and more diversified 

than ever before

2017 has been another very exciting year for ZPG 
as we continued to help our consumers to make 

smarter property and household-related decisions 

and our partners to operate more effectively. 

The combination of our underlying organic growth 

and strategic acquisitions has made us stronger 
and more diversified than ever before, resulting 
in record revenues up 24% to £244.5 million and 
record Adjusted EBITDA up 25% to £96.4 million.

Alex Chesterman OBE, 
Founder & CEO

Delivering on our strategy and mission
We have made significant progress 
towards our mission of being the platform 
of choice for consumers and partners 
engaged in property and household 
decisions. During the Period, we announced 
five acquisitions, three further strategic 
investments and the launch of two new 
national marketing campaigns.
Our audience continued to grow and 
remains highly engaged with a new record 
of 648 million visits to our websites, 
of which 72% were via mobile devices. 
We launched new national advertising 
campaigns for both our Zoopla and uSwitch 
brands. Zoopla’s new campaign highlighted 
how we can help simplify the process of 
moving home, through the eyes of hermit 
crabs, the world’s most prolific home 
movers. uSwitch’s new marketing campaign 
unveiled an updated logo identity and new 
brand slogan – “Switching made simple”. 
Both campaigns resulted in record levels 
of national brand awareness. As a result 
we generated a record of over 56 million 
leads for our more than 25,000 partners 
during the Period. 

08 

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Our cross-sell strategy to both consumers 
and partners is working. We are engaging 
our consumer audience effectively and are 
driving thousands of incremental leads 
across our platforms. In March we launched 
our innovative MovePlanner tool on Zoopla 
which helps consumers manage everything 
move-related in one place and allows us to 
generate leads for conveyancing, removals, 
insurance, energy, broadband and more. 
This tool is now generating over 10,000 
incremental leads per month for our 
Comparison partners. Zoopla is also now 
driving over 25% of the overall mortgage 
traffic to uSwitch.
We continued to attract a focused, 
transaction-ready audience to our uSwitch 
website with account sign-ups increasing 
by 60% to 1.9 million at the end of the 
Period. Consumers can now manage 
multiple products within their account and 
set reminders for contract end dates so that 
they never miss an opportunity to switch 
to a better deal. In addition, uSwitch’s app 
won numerous awards during the Period 
including ‘Most innovative use of mobile’ 
and ‘Best app’ at the MOMA Awards and 
‘Best use of mobile’ at the DADI Awards.
The cross-sell opportunity to our Property 
partners has been significantly enhanced 
through the acquisitions of TechnicWeb, 
Hometrack, ExpertAgent and Ravensworth. 
We are now able to offer best-in-class 
portal, software, websites, data and print 
services to our partners. Our MoveIT platform 
generated over £1 million in referrals fees 
for our partners and has become a net revenue 
generator for a number of agents who are able 
to earn an additional £1,000+ per transaction 
by offering additional relevant services to 
consumers including conveyancing, mortgages 
and energy switching. As at the end of the 
Period the average number of products per 
partner was up 27% to 1.4.
To reflect the evolution of the business, 
following the recent acquisitions ZPG 
will update its divisional key performance 
indicators (‘KPIs’) from FY2018 onwards. 
In Property, the Company will report 
revenue by Marketing, Software and Data 
and its total number of unique Property 
partners and average revenue per partner 
(ARPP) across the division. 

In Comparison, the Company will report 
revenue by Energy, Communications and 
Finance and its total number of Comparison 
leads and average revenue per lead (ARPL) 
across the division. Full details of the like for 
like performance under the new methodology 
(including acquisitions in both periods) can 
be found on page 40.

Acquisitions and partnerships
We completed four acquisitions during 
the Period and one following the end of the 
Period, enhancing our product propositions 
and cross-sell opportunities to both our 
consumers and partners. 
November 2016: TechnicWeb is one 
of the UK’s leading estate agency website 
design and hosting businesses. This acquisition 
has now been integrated into our wider 
business and gives our partners the ability 
to instantly refresh their online presence with 
a choice of different fully mobile-optimised 
website designs. 
January 2017: Hometrack is the UK’s 
leading provider of residential property 
market insights and analytics. This acquisition 
has helped us to further differentiate our 
products for both consumers and partners 
and has also introduced a new set of partners 
to ZPG including 18 of the top 25 mortgage 
lenders in the UK.
March 2017: ExpertAgent is a leading 
property software provider that provides 
essential systems for the day-to-day 
management of estate agent businesses. 
By integrating with existing ZPG products 
we are able to ensure all of our partners 
benefit from a choice of platforms suitable 
to their requirements.
September 2017: Ravensworth is the leading 
provider of integrated print solutions to over 
4,500 UK estate agent branches. This deal 
further enhances ZPG’s comprehensive 
product offering for its Property partners 
which now includes portal, software, websites, 
on-demand print and data services.

October 2017 (following the end of the 
Period): Money is one of the UK’s leading 
finance comparison websites, helping 
consumers to compare thousands of deals 
in more than 60 product categories 
including mortgages, loans, credit cards, 
bank accounts and insurance. 
We also made further strategic investments 
in Neos; the UK’s first home insurance 
provider that provides the latest connected 
home technology and Zero Deposit; an 
exciting new insurance product that replaces 
the need for tenants to place a security 
deposit at the beginning of a tenancy. 
Additionally we took an equity stake in 
PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based 
business which owns the leading property 
portals across the Middle East and 
North Africa.
These new acquisitions and strategic 
partnerships help to further differentiate 
our products and services.

and partnerships on page 12 

Property
Revenues in our Property division increased 
by 41% to £122.3 million for the Period, 
driven by strong demand for our additional 
upsell products, further migration of our 
software partners to cloud-based products 
and a continuation of returning portal partners. 
This figure includes a full 12 months of trading 
from Property Software Group, which was 
acquired on 28 April 2016, as well as the 
post-acquisition trading of TechnicWeb, 
Hometrack, ExpertAgent and Ravensworth 
which were acquired during the Period. 
On a like for like basis (including acquisitions 
in both periods) Property revenue increased 
by 9%.
We saw the total number of unique Property 
partners increase by 12% to 24,962 at the end 
of the Period. This figure has been restated 
to align portal and software partner count 
under the same methodology as previously 
announced at the half year1. The number of 
UK Agents advertising across our Property 
platform increased by 6% to 14,775 and our 
inventory grew by 5% to over 969k listings 
at the end of the Period.

Strategic reportChief Executive Officer’s statement and business review continued

Property continued
ARPP increased by 5% to £358 due to 
strong demand for premium portal products, 
the continued migration of software partners 
to cloud-based products and the inclusion 
of acquisitions.
The combination of strong organic 
growth and the integration of acquisitions 
enables ZPG to provide the UK’s most 
comprehensive product offering to its 
Property partners including best-in-class 
portals, software, websites, data and print 
services to help our partners market, manage 
and maximise their business opportunities. 
Traffic to our Property platform has continued 
to grow to over 48 million visits per month, 
up 6% year-on-year (YoY), delivering over 
22 million leads to our Property partners 
over the Period, with appraisal leads up 
33% YoY.
We have substantially enhanced the 
breadth of our Property Marketing 
proposition to include the provision 
of cloud-based websites via TechnicWeb 
(acquired 1 December 2016) and on-demand 
print services solutions via Ravensworth 
(acquired 1 September 2017). 
Our Property Software business is performing 
well with the continued migration of partners 
from desktop to cloud-based products, growing 
from 39% at the end of September 2016 
to 46% at the end of September 2017. 
On 28 February 2017, we acquired 
ExpertAgent, one of the UK’s leading 
cloud-based software providers, further 
enhancing our stable of software products 
and enabling us to offer even more partners 
the ability to generate additional revenues 
through the integration of our MoveIT 
and PropertyFile products into the 
ExpertAgent platform.
The acquisition of Hometrack, the UK’s 
leading provider of residential property market 
insights, on 31 January 2017, formed the 
cornerstone of our Property Data business. 
Since the acquisition, Hometrack has signed 
new deals with TSB and Bank of Ireland 
and extended its relationship with HSBC, 
and now serves 18 of the top 25 mortgage 
lenders in the UK. We have also made good 
progress on the integration of Hometrack’s 
valuation data into the overall business with 
the coverage of Zoopla’s house price estimates 
increasing to over 80% of UK households. 

“ I would like to welcome the teams 
from TechnicWeb, Hometrack, 
ExpertAgent, Ravensworth and 
Money to the ZPG family and thank 
the entire team for their continued 
commitment to our mission.”

Comparison 
We experienced strong levels of switching 
across all Comparison verticals, helping our 
consumers to save over £400 million off 
their household bills during the Period. 
Revenues in our Comparison division 
increased 10% to £122.2 million and we 
generated 34.3 million leads for our 
Comparison partners during the Period, 
up 13% YoY. ARPL decreased by 3% to 
£3.57 reflecting a shift in product mix 
within the Communications vertical. 
As a backdrop to this year, we saw 
exceptionally strong switching volumes 
in both the Energy and Communications 
verticals in 2016 from our market-leading 
collective switches, energy supplier price 
cuts and strong competition amongst 
communications suppliers.

 The total number of unique Property partners has been restated to exclude 788 legacy software customers of Property Software Group who are not paying for an active support 
contract and to include Zoopla Advertising and Data partners.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

In September 2017, the CMA published 
its final report as part of its market study 
into Digital Comparison Tools (DCTs) which 
highlighted how comparison services are 
putting power into the hands of the consumer 
and driving increased competition, highlighting 
the ongoing regulatory support for the role 
of DCTs.

Our talent
We grew our team by 20% over the 
Period from 735 to 882 staff members as a 
result of both organic growth and strategic 
acquisitions. We remain passionate about 
being a market-leading employer and providing 
a world-class environment and continue 
to place significant emphasis on employee 
engagement and wellbeing by investing 
in market-leading benefits. Our London 
headquarters was recently named “One of 
the coolest offices in Britain” by Glassdoor.

in property and household decisions. We will 
continue to invest in the business for the 
long term and look forward to launching

Q&A

      Q: How do you target and identify 
strategic opportunities?
A: We continue to be one of the 
fastest growing tech businesses in the 
UK organically. However, we have also 
supplemented that growth via targeted 
M&A and strategic partnerships. We 
look to identify businesses that fit 
clearly within our strategy and can help 
accelerate our growth and market 
position or improve our product 
proposition. We are very ambitious 
and there is a lot we want to do and 
M&A and strategic partnerships have 
played an important role in our growth 
story and strategy to date. See page 12 
for more on our M&A.

      Q: Are you pleased with how the 
rollout of the MoveIt tool is going?
      A: Absolutely, but we’re really only just 
getting started. MoveIt has been 
designed to help provide new revenue 
streams to our partners and boost their 
bottom lines. It is a real win for 
consumers who now get access via 
their agent to recommended services 
and providers and for partners who 
can build their own supplier panels to 
offer far more to their customers, from 
conveyancing and removals to financial 
services products and utilities.

      Q: With almost 1,000 staff in 
multiple locations, how do you keep 
everyone up to date?
A: Making sure we have regular and 
effective internal communications is a 
critical part of ensuring employees are 
engaged and have the tools they need 
to do their job. We have a dedicated 
Employee Engagement Manager whose 
role is to lead on our engagement and 
internal communications strategy. We 
also hold regular divisional and full 
Company meetings and events to 
provide the latest updates on business 
performance, industry news and strategy.

The Energy vertical particularly benefited 
from returning switchers on fixed-term deals 
and supplier price rises, enabling us to reach 
a new milestone of over one million energy 
switches in a 12 month period. 
Our Communications vertical performed 
in line with expectations. Mobile switching 
was boosted by increased competition 
amongst suppliers and ongoing optimisation 
of the consumer experience driving greater 
lead generation and broadband switching 
benefited from strong consumer demand 
whilst fully absorbing the changes to the 
advertising standards which came into effect 
at the beginning of the year. We continued to 
develop our Finance offering and significantly 
enhanced our proposition with the acquisition 
of Money after the end of the Period.

M&A and partnership activity

Diversification of our brands,  

products and revenues 

We have a successful track record of M&A activity 
which supports strong organic growth and helps 

accelerate the delivery of our mission. 

When reviewing our strategic opportunities for growth we apply the following filters:

Great strategic  

fit?

Significant growth 

opportunity?

Market leading/ 

innovative?

Build, buy  
or partner?

Strong return 
on investment?

We announced five acquisitions during 
2017, TechnicWeb, Hometrack, ExpertAgent, 
Ravensworth and Money (completed following 
the end of the Period), which enhance both 
our consumer and partner propositions and 
give us a unique product portfolio and 
cross-sell opportunity. 

We also made a further three strategic 
investments in Neos, Zero Deposit and 
PropertyFinder Group, which together with 
our existing investments and partnerships 
provide us with differentiated products and 
services as well as valuable insights into some 
of the leading innovators in our markets.

Each acquisition or partnership allows 
us to offer the widest range of products 
and services across our platform to both 
our consumers and partners and further 
diversifies ZPG’s brands, products and 
revenue opportunities.

Strategic reportOur markets

Delivering  

transparency and efficiency

Our strategic priorities are designed to help us maximise stakeholder value 

whilst navigating the complex and diverse marketplaces we operate in. 

We empower both consumers and partners throughout the entire property 

lifecycle to make smarter property and household decisions.

CONSUMERS

PARTNERS

Our brands and services are relevant to each and every one 
of the 28 million households in the UK – whether finding, 
moving or managing their home.

Our products and services help over 25,000 businesses make 
smarter property decisions. 

Market trends
•  Proliferation of smartphone devices  

 The UK is becoming increasingly mobile-centric with smartphone 
adoption among adults having risen to 85% during 2017 and 77% 
of adults using a mobile device daily.

•  Increasingly time poor and data hungry  

 With one in two British adults stating that they have “little to no” 
free time there is increased demand for services which help simplify 
our daily activities, saving time and money.  
 

Market trends
•  24/7 demand from consumers 

Mobile device proliferation is changing the way, and the times 
of day, that we are able to interact and transact. Consumers’ ability 
to access information and interact anywhere in the world is putting 
pressure on traditional methods of engagement.

•  Margin pressure and legacy systems  

Low barriers to entry for new start-ups are putting pressure on 
the fee structures of incumbent suppliers and demand for 24/7 
engagement from consumers is putting new pressures on the 
way professionals manage their business.

What we do
•  ZPG delivers transparency and empowers smarter household 
decisions by providing consumers with a free-to-use platform, 
tools and insights. Consumers are able to interact with ZPG’s 
home related partners to find a home, plan their move and 
optimise their running costs in just a matter of minutes.

What we do
•  ZPG offers a one-stop shop for professionals to market, manage 

and maximise their business. By using our best-in-class marketing, 
software and data solutions professionals are able to continually 
improve the service they deliver to their customers whilst also 
driving greater effectiveness and efficiency in their business. 

Brands
•  Zoopla, PrimeLocation, uSwitch and Money.

Services 
•  Property – Marketing, Software, Data – which is covered in more 

detail on page 19.

•  Comparison – Energy, Communications, Finance – which is covered

End markets

Our strategy creates a unique opportunity in markets with significant structural growth drivers. 

The property lifecycle spans two main markets: Property and Comparison. Although each market 
has its own unique drivers, they are inextricably linked by the consumers and partners that depend 
on them throughout the cycle.

18 

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

PROPERTY  Our Property services can be divided into three main sub-verticals: Marketing, Software and Data. 

MARKETING 
Key drivers: Transaction volumes 
and print-to-digital shift
Total property commission earned 
by professionals (including both sales 
and lettings) is the main driver behind the 
total amount spent on property marketing. 
Property professionals advertise via a variety 
of channels including property portals, their 
own websites and print media in order to 
build their brand, sell and let existing inventory 
and win new business. The hyper-local and 
highly competitive nature of estate agency 
underpins long-term demand for marketing 
services. In addition, the proportion spent 
on digital marketing continues to grow 
as property professionals recognise the 
increased efficacy of marketing online.

SOFTWARE 
Key driver: 24/7 consumer 
demand and margin pressure
The property software industry is highly 
fragmented with low churn rates as the 
products provide essential systems for 
the day-to-day management of inventory, 
marketing and communications as well 
as diary management, chain progression, 
business reporting tools and financial 
processes. However, increased demand 
from consumers for 24/7 engagement is 
driving an industry shift towards newer, 
more innovative cloud-based products 
which mean professionals are no longer 
tied to their desks to manage their business.

DATA 
Key driver: Risk management 
and regulation 
Property data is available for consumption 
in two main areas: free to consume data 
and paid-for insight. Free data is helpful 
at the beginning of the property journey 
to help educate property consumers and 
partners, whereas paid-for insight gives 
them the confidence they need to transact. 
Demand for quality bank-grade data is rising 
as consumers and businesses want to be on 
the front-foot when negotiating deals and 
managing the risk associated with their 
largest assets such as their own home 
or property portfolio.

COMPARISON  Our Comparison services can be divided into three main sub-verticals: Energy, Communications and Finance.

ENERGY 
Key drivers: Consumer awareness, 
fixed-term contracts and price volatility
The market for energy switching is growing 
as a result of high-profile press coverage of 
energy supplier price rises, the adoption of 
fixed-term contracts with a natural trigger 
point for switching and increased regulatory 
support for the role of digital comparison 
tools boosting consumer awareness. 
However, despite increased supply-side 
competition and the average household 
savings of hundreds of pounds from switching, 
consumer engagement remains much lower 
than other more established switching 
verticals such as car insurance, creating a 
significant structural growth opportunity. 

COMMUNICATIONS 
Key drivers: Technological 
innovation, infrastructure 
upgrades and competitive deals
Communications includes broadband, TV, 
home phone and mobile phone switching. 
The proliferation of smartphones, the rise 
of over-the-top content providers such as 
Netflix and the roll-out of super-fast broadband 
are changing the way we communicate 
and consume digital media. The increasing 
complexity of packages and interdependency 
of products create a critical need for digital 
comparison tools as consumers seek a 
better deal for their needs.

FINANCE 
Key drivers: Economic 
environment and regulation
The financial services comparison market 
comprises some of the most established 
switching markets in the UK. It can be divided 
into two broad areas: banking (credit cards, 
loans, mortgages, current accounts and credit 
reports) and insurance (car, home, life and 
health insurance). Banking is set to be one of 
the key growth areas as economic uncertainty 
drives increased comparison activity. 

Total market 
opportunity 
£3 billion+

We estimate the total market opportunity from helping consumers to find, move and manage 
their homes to be worth over £3 billion+.

Strategic reportRisk management and key risks

ZPG has a well-developed  
approach to risk management

Risk management is critical to the successful delivery of our strategic 
objectives and to the delivery of long-term growth for the business.

The Company’s approach to risk management
Risk at ZPG is managed functionally and at a consolidated Company 
level. This structure enables the Company to ensure that risks are 
identified across its range of operations, including recent acquisitions. 
The risks are then escalated in a manner which is consistent and aligned 
with the strategic goals. 
In addition to this section on risk management, further detail on the 
Company’s internal control framework has been included on page 31.

Risk assessment  
and escalation

Governance of the risk management framework
The Board recognises that exposure to risk is an inherent part 
of running a business and that rigorous safeguards and a sound risk 
management process are required to mitigate these risks to allow 
the business to deliver successfully against its strategic goals.
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management 
and, as such, is accountable for:
•  determining the Company’s appetite for risk;
•  continually reviewing the overall process for identifying 

and assessing business risks; and

•  ensuring a robust assessment of all the risks, both financial 

and non-financial, facing the Company.

The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, keeps the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Company’s internal control and risk management 
systems and processes under constant review.
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Audit 
Committee considers and updates its risk management procedures 
at each Audit Committee meeting throughout the year. It receives 
and analyses regular assurance reports from Management on matters 
related to risk and control and reviews the timeliness and effectiveness 
of corrective action taken by Management.
30 

Risk management strategy and risk appetite
During the course of the year, the risk management framework 
was reviewed to ensure that it remains relevant and appropriate 
in light of business development, including recent acquisitions. 
As a result of this exercise, a Risk Management Strategy has been 
established for FY18 which aligns with the Company’s strategic 
goals. The Risk Management Strategy was approved by the Board 
at its meeting in September 2017.
In developing the Risk Management Strategy, the Board has considered 
its risk appetite and has established risk appetite statements for the 
following risk categories used by the Company:
•  strategic;
•  reputational;
•  financial;
•  governance;
•  information technology; 
•  people; and 
•  operational.
Each risk category is rated using a “low”, “moderate” or “high” scale. 
There are currently no risk categories where the Board has determined 
the Company to have a “high” level of risk appetite. We deliberately 
seek to manage, rather than eliminate, risk, so as to provide reasonable, 
not absolute, mitigation against material misstatement or loss within 
the business.

Risk management framework
The Company operates three Functional Risk Committees which are 
responsible for formally identifying and assessing operational risk. 
The Executive Management Team is responsible for identifying 
and assessing the Company’s strategic and emerging risks.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Operational risk
Operational risks are identified, assessed and managed by the 
Company’s three Functional Risk Committees:
•  Commercial and Marketing;
•  Finance, HR and Legal (Shared Services); and 
•  Product and Technology.
These Committees are formed of senior members of Management 
and relevant staff responsible for the oversight of key functions 
throughout the Company.
Risk workshops are conducted at least once a year for each of the 
Functional Risk Committees, with the key risks being recorded within 
the respective Committees’ Functional Risk Register (FRR).
FRRs are reviewed by the Executive Management Team on a regular 
basis so that any emerging risks, originating at an operational level, 
can be escalated where necessary. 

Strategic risk
The Executive Management Team meets formally at least once a year 
for a Company-wide strategic risk workshop. Each of the key strategic 
risks identified during the workshop is owned by a member of the 
Executive Management Team and is recorded within the Company’s 
Strategic Risk Register (CSRR). The risk owner is responsible for 
developing and maintaining internal controls to mitigate against the 
Company’s risk exposure. This process is supported by the Company’s 
Finance, Compliance and Legal teams, the recommendations of the 
external auditor and the Company’s own internal audit reviews. 
The CSRR is shared with the Audit Committee and the Board for 
review and challenge, before being approved.
The strategic risks are reviewed regularly throughout the year, with 
changes reflected within the CSRR. The Audit Committee is also 
provided with a risk management update at each Audit Committee 
meeting, along with the CSRR, for discussion, review and challenge.

Risk assessment 
Each of the risks identified is recorded on the relevant Committee’s Risk 
Register and is then assessed by the Committee to establish potential 
causes, likelihood of occurring and the potential impact on the Company.
All of the risks identified by the Functional Risk Committees are then 
considered by the Executive Management Team and other key team 
members at the Company’s strategic risk workshop. The Company’s 
most recent strategic risk workshop was held in September 2017. 
The likelihood and impact of each risk are both scored and combined 
to provide an overall risk score. Each risk within the CSRR is scored 
twice: firstly, excluding the existence of mitigating controls (the inherent 
risk score) and then again once mitigating controls have been taken 
into account (the residual risk score). The difference between these 
scores allows Management, the Audit Committee and the Board to 
gain an understanding of the level of control the Company has over 
each risk.
The principal risks arising from the September 2017 workshop are 
provided on pages 32 to 35.

Risk management and internal control
The Company’s internal control framework is aligned to the “three 
lines of defence” model. Operational Management are the first line 
and they are primarily responsible for the direct management of risk, 
ensuring that appropriate mitigating controls are in place and that they 
are operating effectively. The second line is formed of the Company’s 
internal governance functions such as compliance, commercial finance, 
legal and risk. The third line includes internal audit, external audit 
and other third party auditors and any other independent consultants 
reporting to the Audit Committee.
Further detail on the Company’s internal control arrangements, the 
internal audit function and the associated activities which have been 
conducted over the year are included within the Audit Committee 
report on pages 59 and 60.

Principal risks
The principal risks to the Company, as identified during the Company’s 
September 2017 strategic risk workshop, are outlined on the following pages 
along with details of the potential impact faced, the ways in which we manage 
and mitigate them and any movement in their severity since reported in 2016.
The risk factors described are not an exhaustive list or an explanation of all risks. 
Additional risks and uncertainties relating to the Company, including those that 
are not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems 
immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s business operations, results and/or financial condition.
The Directors have considered the principal risks and uncertainties faced in 
assessing the long-term viability of the Company. The inclusion of a viability 
statement in the Annual Report is a requirement of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, and is designed to encourage the Board to focus on the long term. 
The statement can be found on page 35.

KEY RISK 

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION

Changing market 
environment1
The Company participates 
in fast-moving marketplaces 
which are subject to rapid 
technological developments 
and changes in consumer trends 
which may impact the Company’s 
ability to offer the best products 
and services to its partners 
and consumers.

  Risk unchanged

Integrationofacquisitions
The Company is highly acquisitive, 
which presents inherent operational, 
strategic and cultural challenges.

  Risk increased

The addition of four acquisitions 
during the year, and more recently 
Money, increases the likelihood of this 
risk materialising.

The way in which consumers interact with 
businesses is evolving rapidly.
The Company’s partners are constantly 
developing their business models and the way 
in which they interact with consumers directly. 
Failure of the Company to adapt to meet the 
needs of its partners could lead to a fall in the 
number of partners and revenues.
The Company is also subject to changes 
in policies set by search engine providers. 
Failure to keep pace with these changes may 
lead to the Company’s websites receiving less 
exposure to consumers and result in a fall in 
visitor numbers.

 u Increasing user engagement levels by 

continuing a consumer-centric approach 
to product development.

 u Regular open dialogue with our partners 
to ensure that we continually develop our 
products to meet their needs.

 u Continual optimisation of all our websites 

and products across all platforms and devices.

 u Maintaining organisational flexibility, allowing fast 
responses to new business opportunities or threats.

 u Monitoring and regular review of search engine 

optimisation and digital marketing spend.
 u Regular monitoring of changes in market 

environment and emerging trends.

The challenges surrounding integrating 
different cultures, working practices and 
locations could impact team retention 
and performance.
The inability to successfully integrate our 
acquisitions may adversely affect consumer 
and/or partner experience with a resulting 
impact on strategic cross-sell opportunites 
and the Company’s future revenues.
In addition, there is the possibility that the 
financial and operational control environments 
of acquired entities are not as established as 
those of the Company or those required when 
operating in a listed environment. 

 u Oversight of the enlarged Company, by an 

Executive Management Team experienced in 
dealing with acquistions, to ensure harmonisation 
of strategy and objectives across the Company.

 u Clear communication of the Company vision 

and strategy to align the team.

 u Centralised shared service functions across 

finance, HR and legal.

 u Hometrack now based out of The Cooperage 

to encourage greater integration.

 u Communicating the benefits of acquisitions 

to both partners and consumers.

 u Forming functional teams across the Company 

where possible.

KEY RISK 

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION

Any failure of the Company’s IT infrastructure 
through error or attack could impair the 
operation of the Company’s websites and 
services, the processing and storage of data  
and the day-to-day management of the 
Company’s business.
In addition, any theft or misuse of data held 
within the Company’s databases could have 
both reputational and financial implications  
for the Company.

 u Regularly testing the security of the IT systems  
and platforms, including penetration testing and 
testing of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attack procedures.

 u Maintaining separate platforms for our portals, 

websites, software and data services.

 u Restricting access to data, systems and code and 
ensuring all systems are secure and up to date.

 u Providing training for staff on information 
security, data protection and compliance 
and operating a Company-wide data policy.

Competition for qualified talent is intense and 
an inability to attract highly skilled employees 
could adversely impact the Company’s 
operations, financial condition or prospects.
Similarly, an inability to motivate, develop and 
retain key team members could adversely 
impact the Company’s operations, financial 
condition and prospects.
The Company has a track record of growth 
through acquisition – an inability to retain key 
team members from these businesses could 
increase business risk in the event of reliance 
on their business-critical knowledge.

 u Building a strong employee brand in the 
recruitment market and building strong 
talent pipelines.

 u Operating a structured approach to recruitment 

using specialist teams to ensure timely 
recruitment of high quality employees.

 u Investing in succession planning and improving 
learning and development, giving opportunities 
for employees to upgrade skills.

 u Investment in our offices and team environments.
 u Providing competitive reward and compensation 
packages to all staff, comprising a blend of short 
and long-term incentives for managers.

 u Instilling the culture of the Company to build 

and maintain staff loyalty.

There is a risk that changes to the regulatory 
environment could require the Company to 
revise its strategy, operations or business model.
Changes in regulation may also impact 
the Company’s profitability via increased 
compliance costs or a fall in revenues as a 
result of subsequent changes in consumer 
or partner behaviour.
Non-compliance with regulations set 
by a regulatory body may also have both 
reputational and financial implications.

 u Maintaining regular open and constructive 

dialogue with all significant regulatory bodies.
 u Implementing processes to ensure compliance 

with all mandatory reporting obligations including 
a dedicated Regulation and Compliance team.
 u Regular monitoring of regulatory risks by the 

Board, the Audit Committee, the legal function 
and internal audit and throughout the business.

IT systems and cyber security
A number of the Company’s 
IT systems are interdependent 
and a failure in one system or 
a security breach may disrupt 
the efficiency and functioning 
of the Company’s operations.
The Company is also exposed 
to the increasing risk associated 
with cyber-attacks.
The Company holds consumer 
and partner data which could be 
susceptible to loss or theft. 

  Risk unchanged

Retention and recruitment
Success depends on the continued 
retention and performance of the 
Company’s valued employees. 
Skilled development, technical, 
operating, sales and marketing 
personnel are essential for the 
business to meet its strategic 
goals and the Company operates 
in markets with a high demand 
for high calibre personnel.

  Risk unchanged

Regulatory environment
The Company operates in a 
number of regulated environments. 
Certain revenue streams within the 
Comparison division are regulated 
by the FCA. The Comparison 
division also voluntarily complies 
with the Ofgem Confidence 
Code is involved in regular 
communication with Ofcom.

  Risk increased

Increased levels of Government policy 
review and proposals within markets 
we operate in have impacted our 
exposure to this risk.

Strategic reportRisk management and key risks continued

KEY RISK 

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION

Macroeconomic conditions
The Company derives a 
material share of its revenues 
from the UK and also now 
internationally, with operations 
in Australia. The Company is 
therefore largely dependent on 
the macroeconomic conditions 
in the UK as well as being exposed 
to changes in macroeconomic 
conditions internationally.

  Risk unchanged

Competitive environment
The Company operates in 
marketplaces which are highly 
competitive. The actions of the 
Company’s competitors, and/or 
our own inaction, can have a 
significant and adverse impact 
on the Company.

  Risk decreased

Our increasingly diversified position, 
including the addition of Hometrack 
and Money, has reduced our  
exposure to volatility in individual 
competitive markets.

Data governance
(Previously considered within 
regulatory “environment”).
The Company’s operations rely 
on the effective governance and 
appropriate use of data we control 
and process for the benefit of 
consumers and our customers.
New for FY18 reporting.

Brexit-specific considerations have been 
outlined on page 35.
Changes in the UK, European and Australian 
economies have the potential to adversely 
impact the demand for our products and 
services in the markets we operate in. Such 
changes could affect the average property 
prices, the number of mortgage approvals 
and the volume of transactions in the UK 
housing market.
Subsequently, the marketing, data 
and software purchasing budgets of 
the Company’s partners could decrease, 
which could reduce demand for the 
Company’s services.

If competitors can provide, or are perceived 
to provide, an enhanced partner or consumer 
service then there is a risk to the Company’s 
forecasted revenue and other KPIs.
The Company invests significantly in marketing 
to build brand awareness and drive traffic to 
its websites. Increased digital marketing 
expenditure by competitors, or general price 
increases, may cause the Company to incur 
additional marketing spend to ensure that it 
can continue to compete effectively.
There is a risk that competitors entering or 
targeting the Company’s primary revenue 
markets may reduce the Company’s relative 
market share in one or more of the markets 
we operate in. 

 u Regularly reviewing market conditions and indicators.
 u Building consumer and partner brand loyalty.
 u Maintaining a flexible cost base that can respond 

to changing conditions.

 u Diversifying risk by maintaining a balance between 
different revenue streams, including diversification 
through the acquisitions of Hometrack and Money 
(1 October 2017), in order to provide protection 
against volatility within our markets.

 u Developing revenue streams in other related/

adjacent markets.

 u Promoting the benefit and potential savings 
for consumers of home (and now financial) 
services switching.

 u Ensuring partners understand the unique 

value proposition that can be provided through 
our websites, products and services.

 u Offering attractive and competitive pricing 

packages to partners.

 u Continuing to develop and extend the Company’s 

innovative product offering and improve the 
value provided for partners.

 u Developing and maintaining a number of strong 

consumer brands through marketing.

 u Diversifying risk through multiple revenue streams.

The acquisition of additional brands allows us 
to control and process increasing levels of data 
which can be used to target product offerings, 
deliver synergies and, ultimately, provide the 
best consumer experience and partner value. 
Should we be unable to therefore maximise on 
this opportunity we will be unable to maximise 
our revenues.
In addition, insufficient understanding 
of what data we hold and how we can 
appropriately use it can have a significant 
effect on our reputation as well as the 
potential for financial penalties. 

 u Established Data & Analytics function with newly 

appointed Data Director as of October 2017.

 u Legal function with specialist data governance 

expertise and Data Protection Manager.

 u Established ZPG Company-wide Data Working 

Group, which includes relevant individuals 
throughout all levels of the business.

lead to a fall in consumer confidence, reducing 
traffic and leads for the Company’s partners 
and in turn impacting the Company’s revenue.
There is also a risk that the Company’s

existing relationship with the Company as 
a result of any reputational damage, which 
would directly impact the Company’s revenues.

KEY RISK 

DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT

MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION

Failure of the Company to comply with 
its existing debt covenants may lead to a 
default on the Company’s borrowings and a 
requirement for the Company to repay any 
amounts outstanding or to renegotiate the 
terms of its facility.
The level of debt within the business and 
the covenants in place may also restrict the 
amount of funds available for future growth, 
including future M&A activity. 

 u Negotiating sufficient headroom within 
the Company’s existing facility, including 
renegotiation on the acquisition of Money.

 u Consideration of current debt covenants embedded 

into budgeting and forecasting processes.

 u Regularly monitoring compliance with current 

debt covenants and available headroom.

 u Proactive cash management.
 u Consideration of additional or alternative 
funding should significant opportunities 
for growth be identified.

Debt covenants and funding
The Company holds external 
debt and therefore must ensure 
compliance with its covenant 
ratios. The Company also needs 
to ensure that it has the funding 
required to deliver on its strategy 
and future growth plans and that 
it manages its debt and cash 
balances effectively. 

  Risk unchanged

We have increased our leverage as 
a result of recent acquisitions but 
consider there to be no material 
change in our ability to meet our 
debt covenants.

The EU referendum
The result of the UK’s EU referendum in 2016 increased the level 
of macroeconomic uncertainty, increasing the likelihood of the impacts 
outlined under “macroeconomic conditions” above. In light of the 
continued macroeconomic uncertainty, and the mitigating factors set 
out below, there has been no material change to the severity of this 
risk for the Company throughout the year. 
During the year, the Company has continued to consider the impact 
of this result on the business and its potential implications. The Directors 
believe that the Company’s multi-channel, multi-brand strategy creates 
a diverse revenue base which means it is well placed to minimise any 
negative impacts. In particular:
•  the increasingly diversified market position resulting from the 

Company’s most recent acquisitions;

•  the Property division is largely subscription based and is therefore 
less susceptible to short-term shocks or variations in the property 
market or wider economy;

•  a large proportion of our Property partners are engaged in both sales 
and lettings, which reduces the risk of any downturn in the property 
market on their businesses;

•  an economic downturn increases the propensity for consumers to 
search our Comparison platforms for the best deals to save money 
on their household expenses; and

•  a weaker Pound may lead to higher price inflation in areas such 

as energy bills, which may benefit our Comparison division.

Viability statement
As detailed above, the Directors have conducted a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Company and believe that the Company 
is well placed to successfully manage these risks. Therefore, in accordance 
with the 2014 revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due for the next three years. The Directors continue to believe that a 
three year viability period is appropriate to ensure that forecasting is 
reasonable and that the Company can conduct a reasonable identification 
and assessment of its foreseeable principal risks. The following factors, 
which were identified in the prior year, continue to be relevant: 
•  the Company operates in markets which are subject to rapid 

technological, consumer and regulatory changes;

•  the Company operates a three year planning cycle; and

•  the Company has engaged in a high number of significant acquisitions, 

which are constantly evolving the business and changing future 
cash flows.

In arriving at their conclusion, the Directors considered the Company’s 
forecast financial performance and cash flows over the three year 
viability period. The forecast has then been subject to sensitivity 
analysis, both based on across-the-board changes to revenue and 
expenditure, as well as scenario analysis to reflect the estimated 
impact of the principal risks identified above. The following list 
provides examples of the sensitivities performed: 
•  periodic increases to LIBOR, impacting the Company’s finance costs;
•  weaker UK GDP growth over the next three years than forecast by 

the OECD;

•  changes in market conditions requiring responsive increases in costs;
• 

loss of certain material revenue contracts across each of the 
Company’s revenue streams; 

•  underachievement of the Company’s cross-sell strategy;
•  changes in regulation set by regulators, such as Ofgem and Ofcom, 

leading to a reduction in consumer switching;

• 

•  financial penalties, as well as a reduction in revenue resulting from 

reputational damage, due to non-compliance with GDPR; and
increase in IT security costs in response to external attack/data hack, 
as well as a reduction in revenue resulting from reputational damage.
Mitigations to address the materialisation of any significant challenge 
to forecasted cash flows include actions such as a reduction in 
brand marketing, a freeze in staff headcount and/or a reduction 
in dividend pay-out. 
The Directors note that the Company’s current debt facility requires 
renewal in April 2020, which is within the final year of the viability 
period. For this reason, it is not appropriate to consider a longer 
viability period. The Directors are comfortable that the Company 
has sufficient assets and future cash flows to successfully renegotiate 
or extend its current facility and therefore the assumption made by 
Management that the facility continues to be in place until at least 
November 2020 is considered reasonable.
The analysis considered the Company’s ability to meet its operational 
and financial obligations throughout the Period, including compliance 
with the Company’s existing debt covenants. Based on the analysis 
performed, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due for the next three years.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Revenue increased by 24% to £244.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA 
increased by 25% to £96.4 million compared to the same 12-month 
period last year. The increase was driven by a strong underlying 
performance across both divisions together with the inclusion 
of in-year acquisitions. These results include a full 12 months of 
trading from Property Software Group, which was acquired on 
28 April 2016, as well as trading from the date of the acquisition 
of TechnicWeb, Hometrack, ExpertAgent and Ravensworth. 
Full details of the like for like performance (including acquisitions 
in both periods) can be found on page 40.
Statutory Profit for the year was up 2% to £37.4 million after the 
impact of increased deal related exceptional costs, amortisation of 
intangibles assets arising on acquisitions and share-based payments. 
Statutory basic EPS marginally decreased to 8.8 pence as a result of 
the placing of 20.9 million shares to help fund strategic acquisitions. 
When reviewing performance, the Directors use a combination of 
both statutory and adjusted performance measures. The adjusted 
performance measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted 
basic EPS, provide additional information in line with how financial 
performance is measured by Management and reported to the 
Board. These measures are reconciled in the Summary Income 
Statement below.
During the Period, ZPG secured a £125.0 million extension to its 
credit facilities and raised £74.3 million (net of fees) through a share 
placing to help fund acquisitions. As at 30 September 2017, ZPG had 
a leverage of 2.0x with net debt of £191.5 million and headroom against 
its covenants.
The Company maintains a target dividend pay-out ratio of 35-45% 
of profits excluding share-based payments and exceptional items, 
and the Directors have proposed a final dividend of 3.8 pence per share. 
This brings total dividends for the 2017 financial year to 5.7 pence 
per share, up 10% on the same period last year, which represents 
a 40.4% pay-out ratio.

 Agency includes 12 months of trading from Property Software Group, 10 months of 
trading from TechnicWeb, seven months of trading from ExpertAgent and one month 
of trading from Ravensworth.

2  Other includes eight months of trading from Hometrack.
The Property division generated £122.3 million of revenue, up 
41% on the same period last year. Agency revenue, which includes 
acquisitions, was up 31% at £87.1 million. Excluding acquisitions, 
revenue generated from UK estate and lettings agents advertising 
across ZPG’s Property platform (UK Agency) was up 8% driven by 
returning partners and demand for depth products such as Valuation 
Booster, Premium Listings and AdReach. New Homes revenue increased 
12% to £13.1 million, driven by demand for additional products like 
Area Sponsorship and targeted email marketing campaigns. Other 
Property revenue of £22.1 million was up 160% on the same period 
last year as a result of the inclusion of eight months of trading from 
Hometrack. Excluding Hometrack, Other Property revenue, which 
is made up largely from third party advertising, increased by 7%.
The Comparison division generated £122.2 million of revenue, up 10% 
against tough comparators last year as outlined in the Business Review. 
Energy generated £60.1 million of revenue, up 14% on the same period 
last year, driven by returning switchers on fixed-term deals and supplier 
price rises driving increased awareness of the benefits of switching. 
Communications revenue was flat at £44.0 million after the vertical 
absorbed the impact of changes to the advertising standards for 
broadband as outlined in the Business Review. Other Comparison 
revenue, which is predominantly generated from financial products 
such as banking and credit cards, generated £18.1 million of revenue, 
up 27%.

Operating costs 
Operating costs increased 23% to £148.1 million comprising Staff 
costs of £51.6 million, Marketing costs of £77.1 million and Other costs 
of £19.4 million. The increase in costs is largely attributable to the 
inclusion of acquisitions, above-the-line advertising costs associated 
with two national advertising campaigns for both Zoopla and uSwitch 
and costs associated with ZPG’s new headquarters.

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 25% to £96.4 million year-on-year. 
Property Adjusted EBITDA increased to £55.5 million driven by a 
strong underlying performance, the inclusion of 12 months of trading 
from Property Software Group and acquisitions during the Period. 
The Property margin increased from 44% to 45% during the Period 
as a result of the strong underlying performance across the Company’s 
Property Marketing vertical and the inclusion of the eight months 
of trading from the higher margin Hometrack business.

37

Strategic reportFinancial review continued

Adjusted EBITDA continued
Comparison Adjusted EBITDA increased to £40.9 million as a result 
of the strong switching performance across the division. The margin 
reduced slightly to 33% from 35% as a result of ZPG’s additional 
strategic investment in brand advertising for uSwitch and the 
strong performance in the same period last year as outlined in 
the Business Review.

Share-based payments
The share-based payments charge increased as expected from 
£4.8 million to £7.6 million in line with 2017 grants for the LTIP 
and deferred bonus schemes.

Depreciation and amortisation of other intangible assets
Depreciation decreased to £1.2 million due to the write-down of 
leasehold improvements at the Company’s previous office headquarters 
recognised in the previous period. Amortisation of other intangible 
assets increased to £2.6 million reflecting the Company’s ongoing 
capital expenditure on further development of its integrated 
products such as the MovePlanner.

Amortisation of acquired intangible assets
ZPG splits out amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions 
and amortisation of other intangibles for the purposes of calculating 
Adjusted basic EPS. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
increased to £14.6 million as a result of the inclusion of amortisation 
arising on the acquisitions of TechnicWeb, Hometrack, ExpertAgent, 
Ravensworth and a full year of Property Software Group.

Exceptional items
Exceptional items include costs that Management believes to be 
exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence. Total exceptional 
items were £16.7 million in 2017 which includes £14.7 million relating 
to continuing deferred consideration and Management shareholder 
bonuses resulting from acquisitions, £3.8 million of transaction costs 
relating to the Hometrack, ExpertAgent and Money acquisitions and 
an exceptional non-cash gain of £1.5 million on the disposal of the 
Propertyfinder.com domain name which was transferred during 
the period for 1% of the issued share capital of Property Finder 
International Limited.

Net finance costs
The Company incurred net finance costs of £5.6 million during 
the Period. The increased charge reflects the £125 million increase 
in the Company’s credit facility since 30 September 2016 to £325 million 
to help fund strategic acquisitions.

Income tax expense
The Company’s income tax charge was £10.7 million representing 
an effective income tax rate of 22%. This is higher than the statutory 
tax rate of 19.5% for the Period due to non-deductible transaction 
costs and management deferred and contingent consideration 
expenses arising on acquisitions.

Profit for the year 
Adjusted Profit for the year, calculated as profit for the year 
after adding back exceptional items and amortisation of intangible 
assets arising on acquisitions, adjusted for tax, increased by 24% 
to £65.0 million. Statutory Profit for the year increased by 2% 
to £37.4 million after the impact of increased exceptional costs, 
amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions and 
share-based payments. 

Earnings per share (EPS)
Adjusted basic EPS, which strips out the impact of exceptional items 
and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, increased 
by 20% to 15.2 pence. Statutory basic EPS marginally decreased to 
8.8 pence after the placing of 20.9 million shares on 31 January 2017 
to help fund strategic acquisitions.

Other comprehensive income
During the year the Company recognised a non-cash gain of £1.1 million 
on a revaluation of ZPG’s investment partnerships with some of the 
UK’s leading technology start-ups.

The Company was in a strong financial position as at 30 September 2017. 
Net assets were £239.9 million with intangible assets increasing to 
£493.4 million to reflect goodwill and acquired intangible assets resulting 
from the TechnicWeb, Hometrack, ExpertAgent and Ravensworth 
acquisitions. Available for sale financial assets of £4.5 million represents 
the Company’s investment partnerships and the Company’s 1% 
shareholding of Property Finder International Limited as outlined 
in the Business Review. 
Cash and cash equivalents increased to £75.4 million as a result 
of the timing difference between the arrangement of funds to complete 
the Money acquisition that was announced on 7 September 2017 
and completion on 1 October 2017. ZPG’s liability for deferred 
and contingent consideration payable as a result of the Company’s 
acquisitions was £38.4 million at 30 September 2017.

As at 30 September 2017 the Company had net debt of £191.5 million 
including loans and borrowings of £266.9 million. The overall increase 
in net debt can be attributed to the funding of acquisitions during the 
Period and the payment of the deferred consideration relating to both 
the uSwitch and Property Software Group acquisitions, net of increases 
arising from the share placing and operating cash flows.
On 1 October 2017, the acquisition of Money completed and ZPG 
paid an initial consideration of £60 million increasing the Company’s 
net debt to £251.5 million. The Company’s net debt to EBITDA ratio 
remained comfortably within the updated covenant limits with a

 The consolidated statement of cash flows has been represented in the prior year 
to move transaction costs on acquisitions of £1.3 million to operating cash flows. 
The impact was to reduce net cash flows from operating activities by £1.3 million to 
£60.9 million and to reduce the net cash flows used in investing activities to £93.8 million. 

The Company continues to be highly cash generative with net 
cash inflows from operating activities of £81.0 million during the 
Period, up 36% on the same period last year. Capital expenditure 
increased to £7.1 million as a result of the development of new 
integrated projects such as the MovePlanner as outlined in the 
Business Review. The Company had an outflow of £164.3 million 
relating to the cash costs of the acquisitions of Hometrack, ExpertAgent 
and Ravensworth, deferred consideration relating to previous 
acquisitions and investment partnerships.
The investing activities were funded by a net increase in cash from 
financing activities including £74.3 million raised in equity and a net 
increase of £117.5 million in borrowings.

Dividends
The Company maintains a target dividend pay-out ratio of 35-45% 
of profits excluding share-based payments and exceptional items 
based on the strong cash generation and long-term earnings 
potential of the Company. The Directors have proposed a final 
dividend of 3.8 pence, bringing total dividends for the Period to 
5.7 pence per share, up 10% year-on-year, equating to a 40.4% 
pay-out ratio. Subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting this will be paid on 8 February 2018 to those 
shareholders on the share register as at 8 December 2017. 

Subsequent events
On 1 October 2017, ZPG completed the acquisition of Money, one 
of the UK’s leading financial services comparison websites for £80 million 
on a cash-free, debt-free basis, plus a performance-based earn-out 
of up to £60 million. The acquisition was financed through a combination 
of existing cash resources and a £50 million extension to ZPG’s 
credit facilities with an opening net debt ratio of c.2.7x the enlarged 
Company’s Adjusted EBITDA.
As at the date of this report the Company is well advanced in its 
acquisition of Calcasa B.V., a leading provider of automated property 
valuations and statistical market analysis in the Netherlands, for 
€30.0 million (£26.5 million4) on a cash-free, debt-free basis, with 
a performance-based earn-out of up to €50.0 million (£44.2 million4). 
The acquisition is expected to complete on 1 December 2017 and 
will be financed through a combination of cash resources and an 
extension to the Company’s existing credit facilities with an opening 
net debt ratio of c.2.9x the enlarged Company’s Adjusted EBITDA.

Strategic reportOur people and corporate 

social responsibility

Putting people at the 
heart of our business

We are passionate about attracting, 

engaging, developing and retaining the 

best talent in the industry. 

Improvements in talent 
attraction and recruitment
We are passionate about attracting, engaging, 
developing and retaining the best talent in the 
industry. During the year we have significantly 
improved our talent attraction and recruitment 
through the appointment of a dedicated Head 
of Talent, the launch of an improved careers 
section on the ZPG website, including a “Why 
work at ZPG” video, and the roll-out of a new 
end-to-end recruitment process which has 
been streamlined to save hiring managers’ time.

We believe in conversations
For us, communication means conversation. 
With collaboration as one of our core values, 
we are always open to feedback and seek to 
provide as many opportunities for discussion 
as possible. It is vital for us that everyone feels 
they have a voice. At the beginning of the 
year we recruited an Employee Engagement 
Manager to formalise and lead our engagement 
and internal communications strategy and 
we now have an improved Glassdoor rating 
of 4.4 out of 5. 

We have also substantially improved 
communication in line with the growth 
of the business by introducing new monthly 
Company updates, hosted by our CEO, 
which provide regular business and industry 
performance updates. In addition we have 
invested in Peakon, a new employee survey 
tool, to help us regularly measure our 
employee net promoter score (eNPS) and 
key engagement drivers. The first survey, 
using the new tool, saw significantly increased 
participation rates compared to previous tools 
and highlighted that our eNPS currently 
stands above the industry benchmark. 

Home-from-home offices
Following the relocation of all of our 
London-based colleagues to our new 
world-class office near Tower Bridge in 
September 2016, we have invested in several 
improvements to our regional offices during 
2017 to provide the same “home-from-home” 
feel for all of our colleagues. Our London office 
was recently voted one of the “Top ten coolest 
offices in the UK” according to Glassdoor 
and encourages creativity, collaboration and 
socialising between teams, with plenty of 
whiteboards, breakout areas and communal 

spaces like our Games Room and Cafe, 
home to our legendary barista, Bruno. It is 
here that we provide daily breakfast and 
3.00pm snack time to encourage regular 
breaks and refuelling, as well as Friday night 
drinks, all of which are now also enjoyed by 
our regional offices. We have also kitted out 
each regional office with similar spaces for 
rest and play, complete with sofas, pool or 
ping pong tables, dartboards and unlimited 
hot and cold drinks.

We reward and recognise excellence
Our extensive and varied range of benefits 
offers something for every lifestage and lifestyle 
here at ZPG. We pride ourselves on offering 
competitive salaries and market-leading 
benefits, which we continually monitor, 
review and evolve in response to industry 
changes, benchmarking exercises and colleague 
feedback. In addition to the traditional 
offerings, like matched pension contributions, 
birthday day off, subsidised health insurance, 
mental health support and season ticket 
loans, we offer some more creative benefits 
designed to relieve the stresses of everyday 
life, such as a day off when moving home 
and interest-free loans to help get a foot on 
the property ladder. Recognition is important 
to us too, so we celebrate our “ZPG Heroes” 
twice a year by asking all colleagues to vote 
for the person they think personifies our values.

Opportunities to learn and grow
Our colleagues share the same high level 
of ambition as our business and we take 
their development seriously by providing 
the tools and opportunities to help everyone 
reach their full potential at ZPG.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Our Head of Learning & Development 
continues to create and deliver a broad 
range of in-house learning programmes to 
support the diverse needs of our colleagues, 
as well as the longer-term needs of our 
business. This enables us to nurture and 
retain the talent already within our teams 
as well as set our business up for success in 
the future. We offer more than 30 bespoke 
ZPG workshops, totalling more than 100 hours 
of learning per quarter. These are open to all 
colleagues, regardless of tenure or location, 
offering the opportunity to learn new skills 
and create cross-sell opportunities across 
departments. In the last 12 months, more 
than 500 colleagues have received over 
1,300 hours of learning through our in-house 
workshops across multiple offices. 
During the year we successfully became an 
Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM) 
centre, approved to deliver and award the 
Level 3 Diploma for Managers, alongside our 
accredited in-house leadership programmes. 
We also recognise that some people prefer 
to self-learn, so we also offer the opportunity 
to access a wide range of online learning 
resources, including Lynda.com and LinkedIn 
Learning, and unlimited access to Udemy, giving 
our colleagues access to over 60,000 courses.

We are committed to giving back 
and doing the right thing
Charity support
This year colleagues voted for the charity 
they would like to partner with most and 
Cancer Research UK (CRUK) was chosen. 
A regional network of Charity Champions 
was set up and as a result we have been 
able to provide countless opportunities for 
colleagues to support CRUK, from Payroll 
Giving and sporting events, to charity raffles 
and volunteering. We operate a generous 
fund matching scheme, matching up to 
£500 per colleague per year for fundraising 
events in aid of CRUK, and up to £250 for 
any other charity. We also encourage regular 
donations through Payroll Giving by matching 
up to £20 per month for donations to CRUK 
and up to £10 per month to any other charity. 
As a result, we have been awarded the 
Platinum Quality Mark by the Association 
of Payroll Giving Organisations and have 
raised over £23,743 for CRUK so far through 
Payroll Giving alone. Combined with the 
wide range of other fundraising activities 
we have raised a total so far this calendar 
year of £58,453 and expect to raise a further 
£13,600 during the remaining months of 2017. 
This will give us a fundraising grand total of 
£72,000 in our first year’s partnership with 
CRUK. Total charitable contributions made 
to all registered charities during the financial 
year was £63,887 (2016: £39,529).

LAURA BULL – ONE TEAM, ONE DREAM

When it comes to our people, we are all 
about the bigger picture – from spotting 
and developing talent, to supporting 
individuals to land perfect-fit roles.
Take the case of Laura Bull, who joined ZPG 
brand TechnicWeb last year as a Project 
Coordinator, responsible for managing 
delivery of estate agent websites.
Laura’s creativity and marketing prowess 
were soon spotted by her manager, who 
suggested she join ZPG’s marketing team – 
on an initial one-day-a-week basis – to help 
promote the TechnicWeb brand.
During her time there, Laura worked with 
the Head of Trade Marketing and drew up 
a personal development plan which would 
pave the way into a full-time marketing role.

Laura was soon promoted to B2B Marketing 
Executive – a role that incorporates B2B 
marketing and trade campaigns across several 
ZPG brands – and relocated to ZPG’s London 
head offices.
In August 2017, Laura also completed 
a Certificate in Professional Marketing, 
which she says will stand her in good 
stead for her next move within the 
ZPG family.

“ I am in the job I’m in now precisely 
because of the exposure I was 
given to ZPG’s different brands 
and their strategies,” she said. 
“The business has been incredibly 
supportive in my development.”

Diversity and inclusion
We believe that all current and future 
colleagues should have fair and equal access 
to all opportunities within ZPG, regardless 
of their age, sexual orientation, parental 
responsibilities, disability, race, nationality, 
ethnic origin, membership of a trade union, 
religion, belief or gender and this is reflected 
throughout all of our employment policies 
and practices, including recruitment, selection, 
training, promotion, salary reviews and 
flexible working. ZPG’s equal opportunities 
policy is contained in our employee handbook 
which is available to all employees. This sets 
out that it is our policy to select the most 
qualified person for each position within the 
organisation and it is our intent and resolve 
to comply with the requirements and spirit 
of all laws in the implementation of all facets 
of equal opportunity. This policy applies to all 
employment practices and personnel actions 
including, but not limited to, recruitment, 
selection, training, promotion, pay rates, 
discipline and dismissal. ZPG is a member of 
a new working group of businesses, which 
includes peers from Google, Microsoft, 
PwC, Oxfam and the Girl Guides, who have 
united to promote Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and 
women in tech to create more diversity in 
the industry and build a future talent pipeline. 
The working group came together in both 
July and August this year for the first time to 
create a manifesto that will target schools in 
the Government’s social mobility “cold 
spots”, celebrate successful women in tech 
as role models and work with schools across 
the UK to educate pupils about working in 

tech by providing toolkits to teach the teachers. 
We are incredibly proud to be part of such 
a significant project.
We passionately believe in improving 
mental wellbeing throughout the business 
and, following a successful trial partnership 
with Mind, we plan to roll out a programme 
of mental health awareness training to all 
people managers, which will include a 
learning lunch with experts from Google 
this November as part of our twice-annual 
Wellness Week.
In relation to employee involvement, we 
undertake employee surveys twice a year. 
The results are carefully analysed, reviewed 
and, where appropriate, actions are taken 
following discussions with our colleagues. 
We hold monthly “Ask Alex” sessions where 
all employees can get answers to any specific 
work-related queries they might have. We 
also hold weekly “Ask HR” sessions where 
colleagues can drop by at our “surgeries” 
with members of the HR team to discuss 
any personal matters, to talk about benefits, 
to answer questions or just to have a chat.

Supporting our local communities
We recognise the importance of giving 
something back to our communities, 
whether that is through supporting local 
businesses with regular custom in exchange 
for employee discounts, or through donating 
our time to helping others. And we encourage 
all colleagues to donate their valuable time 
by giving them a day off every year to volunteer 
for any charity of their choice, or do a good 
deed for any non-profit organisation, like 
schools and hospitals. It also covers 
donating blood.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

ALFIE TRAISH – THE APPRENTICE

Just as ZPG has grown from the fledgling 
business it was 10 years ago, we are keen 
for our people to grow with us too. And in 
June this year, we employed our first ever 
apprentice – Alfie Traish. 
Alfie arrived at ZPG in September 2016 
on a temporary contract to support IT 
in the office move to The Cooperage. 
By the second time his temporary 
contract was extended, it had become 
clear that Alfie was a perfect fit for ZPG – 
and he was invited to enrol in ZPG’s brand 
new apprenticeship programme.

“I had left college with GCSEs and 
wasn’t sure what I wanted to do,” 
said Alfie. “But I’d loved my role at 
ZPG, as well as the people and the 
culture, so I was delighted to accept 
the offer.”
Alfie is now part-way through a Level 
3 Pathway IT Infrastructure Technician 
Apprenticeship. It is a 12 to 18 month 
programme which covers everything from 
networking and architecture, to cloud services 
and coding, via virtual classroom lectures.
But some of the most valuable learning 
is “on the job”, said Alfie, now aged 20: 

“Being immersed in an IT 
environment with an incredibly 
supportive team, meeting people 
every day and being tasked with 
constantly improving users’ 
experience has given me a real 
sense of satisfaction.”
When asked what his apprenticeship 
highlights have been so far, Alfie said: 
“passing my first module with ease”. 
And, having given his apprenticeship a 
recommendation score of 10/10, it is likely 
others will soon be following in his footsteps.

LAURA WILKINSON’S AGE UK INITIATIVE

During the year one of our colleagues, 
Laura Wilkinson, took the initiative and set 
up an in-house volunteering event in 
partnership with Age UK. With help from 
the charity, Laura arranged for a dozen elderly 
local residents to come to our award-winning 
office for the day where they were offered 
practical and useful guidance on internet 
safety, how to stay in touch online and how 
to compare service providers online and 
save money on their household bills.
Our guests were all greeted by a ZPG 
“buddy” and were given a guided tour 
of the office and the chance to make some 
new connections with one another over 
lunch and a game of bingo. They thoroughly 
enjoyed the day and Laura and the rest of 
the volunteers received a personal thank 
you from Age UK. We hope to replicate 
this event and host similar ones in all of 
our regional offices over the coming year.

In addition to volunteering activities, our 
dedicated uSwitch Community Engagement 
Manager provides free educational services 
to community members in partnership with 
community centres, charities, councils, 
housing associations and MPs to promote 
the benefits of switching energy providers 
and shopping around to save money on a 
whole range of other household bills. 
The Community Engagement Manager 
attends several UK-wide events run by 
various organisations and provides free 
information and the options available for 
getting a better deal on household costs. 
At the events the Community Engagement 
Manager provides energy saving tips, answers 
questions about the energy market and runs 
presentations about our comparison services, 
even providing one-to-one services to 
community members, ultimately empowering 
them to make smarter decisions when it 
comes to managing their home.

Health and safety
We are committed to maintaining a safe workplace for our 
colleagues and ensuring they have the appropriate training and 
working conditions to perform their work safely. It is therefore our 
policy that all of our facilities, products and services comply with 
applicable laws and regulations governing safety and quality, in all 
material respects. We offer fire warden and first aid training to all 
colleagues who wish to support the business in this effort and 
perform weekly fire alarm tests and regular fire drills. We currently 
have two fully trained Display Screen Equipment Assessors within 
the business, promoting positive ergonomic workstations that 
comply with health and safety legislation, including the option 
for adjustable standing desks and ergonomic chairs.

ZPG is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion
Gender pay reporting is a new statutory requirement which provides 
a snapshot of the gender balance within an organisation by measuring 
the difference between the average earnings of all male and female 
employees at all levels. However, gender pay is not the same as 
equal pay.
ZPG carries out regular analysis of pay levels within the business and is 
confident that men and women are paid the same for carrying out work 
of equal value. However, the greater proportion of men than women in 
senior and technical roles has created a gender pay gap at ZPG. 
Although there is no quick fix to the gender pay gap, we don’t believe 
the gap is acceptable and we’ve already taken steps, as part of a wider 
plan, to start addressing the underlying issues causing the gender 
imbalance in technical and senior roles, as outlined below.

Our approach to gender pay
ZPG believes that diversity, including gender diversity, enhances 
business performance and is critical to the delivery of our mission. 
We’ve outlined below why we believe the gap exists, what we’ve 
done about it so far and what we are planning next to help tackle 
the issue. 

Why does the gender pay gap exist? 
While we’re confident that men and women are paid equally for 
doing equivalent jobs across ZPG, the main reason for the gender 
pay gap is that women are under-represented in technical and senior 
roles which are typically higher paid.
Under-representation of women in technical and senior roles is 
driven by a number of factors and to help remedy this more women 
need to be inspired by, and attracted to, STEM (science, technology, 
engineering and maths) subjects. At ZPG we will continue to focus 
on developing a more diverse talent pipeline and promoting flexible 
working practices. 

What we’ve done so far
We’ve further analysed our data on a role-by-role basis and 
concluded that there is no pay inequality. However, it is clear that 
there is a greater proportion of males in the higher paid roles which 
is due both to the smaller proportion of senior women in the business 
and also as a result of the large number of highly paid technical and 
digital roles which, historically, have been seen to be significantly 
male dominated careers.
Pay 
We regularly monitor and carry out salary benchmarking across all 
roles to ensure we pay equitable salaries irrespective of gender.
Recruitment
We’ve reviewed our recruitment practices and made targeted 
changes which has resulted in the hiring of 30 females into digital 
and technical roles in FY17 – representing a third of these hires. 
Education
We’ve set up internal training for our people managers, starting 
with lessons learned by market-leading peers, to ensure they fully 
understand the principles of diversity and inclusion and learn from 
their practices with the aim of making constant improvements.
Leadership
Our Head of Talent has become an active member of the Women in 
Technology group (renamed Tech She Can – together we can change 
the ratio), a group of 16 well-known organisations which have recently 
formed with the objectives of: 
•  generating a lasting increase in the number of girls and young 

women pursuing technology careers; and 

•  sharing and developing best practice.

What we’re doing next 
Flexible working
We are reviewing all our various working arrangements and 
piloting new programmes in areas that are not offering flexible 
and part-time opportunities.
Parental leave
We have revisited our programmes and enhanced them, related 
to length of service. Our intention is to promote parental leave 
and encourage and support returners after their parental absence.
Internal promotions
We are actively focused on internal hires to ensure we develop 
and retain our talent and encourage career development and training 
which is targeted at all our colleagues. We believe this will encourage 
women and minorities to develop their careers at ZPG in a 
supportive environment.
Mentoring programme
We will be establishing a formal internal mentoring programme for all 
our colleagues, with a significant focus on women, to ensure they have 
the support of role models to help them develop to their full potential.

Since 1 October 2013, the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013 has required all 
UK quoted companies to report on their 
greenhouse gas emissions as part of their 
annual directors’ report. 
A report on our output of greenhouse 
gas emissions shows that, when compared 
with other companies of a comparable size, 
the Company’s activities produce a very low 
impact on the environment. The Company’s 
scope 1 and 2 emissions for the year to 
30 September 2017 are set out below. 
Scope 1 emissions relate to the Company’s 
fleet of vehicles, which are used by certain 
employees for business purposes. Scope 2 
emissions relate to the Company’s electricity 
and gas usage. This information is set out in 
the chart opposite. We have measured our 
greenhouse gas emissions using emissions 
factors from the “UK Government Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting”. The period 
covered is that of the financial year to 
30 September 2017. Comparatives for 2016 
have been calculated on a consistent basis. 
CO2 emissions include the impact of 
acquisitions from the date of acquisition. 
In order to provide an intensity ratio for 
our emissions disclosure, we have calculated 
our greenhouse gas emissions per employee. 
The Directors believe that the number of 
employees is the best indicator for a company 
of this size for the purposes of this disclosure. 
The number of employees used is the average 
number of full-time employees over the 
measurement period.

Environmental awareness
We continue to support energy efficiency 
throughout our business activities and 
remain conscious of mitigating any negative 
impact we may have on the environment. 
As a digital business, we naturally operate 
without intensive production processes, 
use of packaging or the need to print out 
substantial amounts of paper, a practice 
which we will continue to maintain. A number 
of sales colleagues are provided with company 
cars to allow them to meet clients within 
designated geographies, but the majority of 
colleagues are office based. Our company-wide 
Bike-to-Work scheme offers our colleagues 
the financial support and incentive to travel 
to and from work in an environmentally friendly 
way and we have doubled our secure cycle 
storage this year at The Cooperage as a result 
of increased demand.
We have recently established an 
Eco Committee, with members from all 
areas and working locations of the business. 
The Committee meets once a month to 
discuss environmental concerns and implement 
improvements throughout the coming year 
and hope to host quarterly inspirational talks 
with environmental experts. 
We always consider the impact on the 
environment as part of the building design 
and as a result have installed motion sensor 
lighting throughout (including meeting 
rooms), water-saving flush systems and 
energy-efficient chiller units within our air 
conditioning system in our London office.

however, the majority of employees are 
office based. The Company also operates 
a “Bike-to-Work” scheme, which offers our

Strategic reportChairman’s introduction  

to governance

We have continued 
to apply the main 

principles and 

provisions of the 
Governance Code

Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to present ZPG’s 
Corporate Governance Report 
for the year.

We have had another exciting year 
of expansion and growth across the business, 
and the Board remains fully committed to 
promoting and maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance. The Board 
believes that this enables the accomplishment 
of the Company’s aims and strategies, whilst 
providing information and transparency to 
ZPG’s various stakeholders.
We have continued to apply the main 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (Governance Code) 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
and the following reports, including those 
from the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees, should provide you with full 
details of the Board’s activities during the 
year, including how it has discharged its 
governance duties and applied the principles 
of good corporate governance set out in the 
Governance Code. Here, you will also find 
details of our governance framework, 
including details of the appropriate risk 
management and internal control systems 
within the Company.

Board changes
We have had one change to the composition 
of the Board this year, which is set out below.

As a reminder, at the time of the Company’s 
initial public offering, the Company entered 
into a relationship agreement (Relationship 
Agreement) with Daily Mail and General 
Trust Plc (DMGT), the ultimate parent 
of the Company’s principal shareholder, 
DMGZ Limited (DMGZ). 
Under the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement, DMGT can appoint two Directors 
to the Board providing it ultimately holds 
more than 25% of the votes exercisable 
at general meetings of the Company. I am 
pleased to welcome James Welsh, who DMGT 
appointed to the Board in January 2017 to 
replace Stephen Daintith. James offered 
himself up for election at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 
2 February 2017, which took place shortly 
after his appointment by DMGT.

Re-election of Directors
Following a performance evaluation of each 
of the Directors this year, I can confirm that 
all Directors have appropriate skill, experience, 
knowledge and expertise to be effective, 
and that they have all demonstrated 
commitment to the role. I further confirm 
that all Directors have allocated sufficient 
time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities and duties effectively.
Accordingly, and as recommended by the 
Nomination Committee, all Directors will be 
offering themselves up for re-election at the 
next AGM to be held on 30 January 2018. 
Biographies of all members of the Board 
appear on pages 50 and 51.

Board evaluation
In the Corporate Governance Statement 
last year, I mentioned that we would consider 
undertaking an externally facilitated review 
of the Board this year. I am pleased to confirm 
that an externally facilitated review of the 
Board was carried out and the results of the 
evaluation were very positive. This is discussed 
further in the Corporate Governance 
Statement on page 56.

Statement of compliance
In the Corporate Governance Report last 
year, it was explained that the Company 
had applied all of the main principles and 
complied with all of the relevant provisions 
of the Governance Code with the exception 
of Provision B.1.2, which recommends that 
at least half of the Board of Directors of a 
UK-listed company, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise Non-Executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which may 
affect, or could appear to affect, the 
Directors’ judgement. I am pleased to 
announce that, from July 2017, the Company 
has applied all of the main principles and 
complied fully with the relevant provisions 
set out in the Governance Code. This is 
discussed further in the Corporate 
Governance Statement.
I hope you find the Corporate Governance 
Report useful and informative.

Corporate governanceRNAANRANRCorporate governance statement

The Company has applied all of the main 

principles of, and complied fully with 

the relevant provisions set out in, 

the Governance Code

Statement of compliance 
The Board remains fully 
committed to promoting 
and maintaining the 
highest standards of 
corporate governance.

This Corporate Governance Report, which 
incorporates reports from the Audit and 
Nomination Committees on pages 58 to 65 
together with the Strategic report on pages 
01 to 47, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 66 to 91 and the Directors’ 
Report on pages 92 to 94, explains how the 
Company complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (Governance Code) and 
the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing 
Rules and Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules throughout the year.
For the year ended 30 September 2017, the 
Company was subject to the edition of the 
Governance Code published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in April 2016, which can 
be found at www.frc.org.uk.
In the Corporate Governance Report last 
year, it was explained that the Company 
had applied all of the main principles and 
complied with all of the relevant provisions 
of the Governance Code with the exception 
of Provision B.1.2, which recommends that 
at least half of the Board of Directors of a 
UK-listed company, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise Non-Executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which may 
affect, or could appear to affect, the 
Directors’ judgement. 
At the time, the Board comprised a 
Non-Executive Chairman and nine other 
Directors, of whom four were considered 
to be wholly independent. Therefore, the 
Company did not fully comply with the 
requirements of the Governance Code 
at the time and we set out our intention 
to explore avenues to resolve this one 
remaining non-compliant element in the 
current financial year.

During the year, the Board carefully 
reassessed Grenville Turner’s independence 
and it was agreed that since Grenville stepped 
down as the Chairman of Countrywide Plc, 
a customer and previously a major shareholder 
in the Company, in April 2016 and since 
Countrywide ceased to be a shareholder 
of the Company from September 2016 
onwards, Grenville would be considered 
independent for the purposes of the 
Governance Code from the conclusion 
of the Board meeting in July 2017 onwards. 
A key part of the Board’s determination is 
that there is no longer any commercial 
relationship or interaction between Grenville 
and Countrywide. In addition to this, there 
are no ongoing relationships between Grenville 
and the directors or senior employees 
of Countrywide. Grenville does not currently 
hold any shares in Countrywide, however 
he is due to receive a minimal amount 
of deferred Countrywide shares in 2018 
as a result of his historic involvement with 
the company. The Board does not deem this 
to be a determinative factor in considering 
his independence. The Board also considered 
Grenville’s contributions to the Board 
since stepping down as the Chairman 
of Countrywide to be of the highest quality 
and is comfortable that Grenville exercises 
independent judgement and oversight, and, 
that his decision-making and views are in no 
way influenced by his historic relationship 
with Countrywide, notwithstanding that 
he stepped down from its board less than 
three years ago.
Therefore, full compliance with the Governance 
Code has now been achieved and I can 
confirm that, from July 2017, the Company 
has applied all of the main principles of, and 
complied fully with the relevant provisions 
set out in, the Governance Code issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council in April 2016.
The Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP, is 
required to review whether the above 
statement reflects the Company’s compliance 
with the Governance Code specified for its 
review by the Listing Rules and to report where 
the above does not reflect such compliance. 
Deloitte has made no such report.

The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible 
for the long-term success of the Company 
and provides leadership to the business. 
It sets the Company’s strategic aims, values 
and standards, and is responsible for the 
conduct of ZPG’s business and development 
whilst reviewing the performance of the 
Management Team. All Directors make 
decisions in accordance with their statutory 
duties, acting in a way in which they consider, 
in good faith, would be most likely to promote 
the success of the Company for the benefit 
of its shareholders as a whole, and, in doing 
so, have regard (amongst other matters) to 
various other stakeholders and considerations. 
This is achieved through continuous 
discussions and evaluations of the impact 
of Board decisions, transactions and other 
matters within the Board’s responsibility 
on these various stakeholder groups and 
considerations. The Board is also collectively 
responsible for ensuring that a thorough 
system of internal control and risk management 
(including financial, operational and compliance 
controls) is in place and for the approval of any 
changes to the capital, corporate and/or 
management structure of ZPG. The Board 
convened 10 times this year to discharge its 
duties, which included discussions of various 
matters relating to the business of the 
Company and in relation to the acquisitions 
of TechnicWeb, Hometrack, ExpertAgent, 
Ravensworth and Money. 
There is a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board’s approval whilst it 
has delegated other specific responsibilities 
to its Committees. The following schedule 
sets out key aspects of the affairs of the 
Company which the Board does not 
delegate. These have not changed from 
previous years.
Where the Board does delegate its 
responsibilities, whether to its Committees 
or to Management, it maintains oversight 
at all times.

Corporate governanceCorporate governance statement continued

The role of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
at the head of the Company between the 
running of the Board and the executive 
responsibility for the running of the 
Company’s business.
The Board is chaired by Mike Evans, 
who was independent on his appointment 
in May 2014. Mike is responsible for the 
effective leadership of the Board, having 
regard to the interests of all stakeholders 
and promoting high standards of corporate 
governance. On the other hand, Alex 
Chesterman, the Chief Executive Officer, 
is responsible for implementing the Board’s 
strategy, overseeing the day-to-day 
management of ZPG and leading the 
Executive Management Team.
The two roles are different and distinct from 
one another. The division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer is clearly established to ensure that 
no single position holds unfettered powers 
of decision making. These divisions have 
been established by the Board, are set out 
in writing and can be viewed on page 53.

The role of the  
Senior Independent Director
Provision A.4.1 of the Governance Code 
provides that the Board should appoint one 
of the Independent Non-Executive Directors 
to the role of a Senior Independent Director 
(SID) to provide a sounding board for the 
Chairman and to serve as an intermediary 
for the other Directors when necessary.
Duncan Tatton-Brown has remained as 
the SID of the Board and is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which 
the normal channels through the Chairman, 
CEO or other Executive Directors have 
failed to resolve or are inappropriate.

Non-Executive Directors
As part of their role as members of a 
unitary board, the Non-Executive Directors 
constructively challenge and help develop 
proposals on ZPG’s strategy.
The Governance Code sets out the 
circumstances that should be relevant to 
the Board in determining whether each 
Non-Executive Director is independent.

Information, meetings and attendance
The Board met 10 times during the year to 
review the operational performance of the 
Company. At these meetings, the Board 
reviewed the Company’s long and short-term 
strategic direction and financial plans and 
monitored the Company’s performance 
against the agreed strategy and business 
plan. Due to the various acquisitions carried 
out in the year, the Board met more often 
than the anticipated number of times, 
and delegated some responsibilities to a 
Transaction Committee, which met twice 
during the year, to make certain decisions 
relating to the transactions.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
that the Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information. Prior to each scheduled 
Board meeting, a pack of documents is 
circulated in respect of the corresponding 
financial period, which includes updates on 
corporate governance, investor relations, 
key performance targets, trading performance 
against the agreed budget and detailed 
financial data and analysis.
Board packs are distributed five working 
days prior to each meeting to provide 
sufficient time for the Directors to review 
their papers in advance. If Directors are 
unable to attend a Board meeting for 
any reason, they nonetheless receive the 
relevant papers and are consulted prior 
to the meeting and their views are made 
known to the other Directors.
All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary, 
who advises the Board, through the Chairman, 
on all governance matters and who has 
responsibility for ensuring compliance 
with the Board’s procedures. The Company 
Secretary’s responsibilities also include 
ensuring good information flows within 
the Board and its various committees and 
between the Senior Management Team 
and the Non-Executive Directors, as well 
as facilitating the induction process for new 
Directors and assisting with the Directors’ 
professional development.
Each of the Directors has the right to have 
his/her opposition to, or concerns over, any 
Board decision noted in the minutes.
Directors may take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense in the 
performance of their duties.

The Board has concluded that Duncan 
Tatton-Brown, Sherry Coutu, Robin Klein 
and Vin Murria were independent Directors 
throughout the Period. Mike Evans was 
independent on appointment as Chairman 
and has remained independent throughout 
the Period. As already mentioned, Grenville 
Turner was determined to be independent 
by the Board in July 2017.
At the time of the Company’s initial public 
offering (IPO), the Company entered into 
a relationship agreement (Relationship 
Agreement) with Daily Mail and General 
Trust Plc (DMGT), the ultimate parent of the 
Company’s current principal shareholder, 
DMGZ Limited (DMGZ). The main purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure 
that the Company and its subsidiaries are 
capable of carrying on their business 
independently of DMGT, that transactions 
and relationships with DMGT are at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms, 
and that the goodwill, reputation and 
commercial interests of the Company 
are maintained. Under the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement, DMGT can appoint 
two Directors to the Board providing it 
ultimately holds more than 25% of the 
votes exercisable at general meetings of 
the Company, and one Director, providing 
it holds more than 10% of those votes.
The Relationship Agreement will remain 
in force for so long as (a) the shares of the 
Company are listed on the premium listing 
segment of the Official List and (b) DMGT 
or any of its associates together are entitled 
to exercise or to control the exercise of 10% 
or more of the votes which are generally 
exercisable at general meetings of the 
Company. The two Directors appointed by 
DMGT are Kevin Beatty and James Welsh 
(who was appointed on 1 January 2017 
following Stephen Daintith’s resignation 
from the Board). The Company confirms 
that the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
have been fully complied with during the year.

Length of appointments
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure in place within ZPG for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board. 
Further details are set out in the Nomination 
Committee Report on pages 64 to 65.
Non-Executive appointments to the 
Board are for a period of up to three years, 
extendable by no more than two additional 
three year periods. The Company extended 
the appointments of those Non-Executive 
Directors where their three year appointment 
terms were reached during the year. 
These were extended by an additional 
three year period.

Development
The Non-Executive Directors have all 
met key members of Senior Management 
and advisers to the Company, many of whom 
have given presentations to the Board and 
Committee members during various Board 
and Committee meetings this past year, 
in order to enable the Directors to familiarise 
themselves with the business. There was 
a scheduled timetable of presentations 
throughout the year.
During the year, the Chairman reviewed 
and agreed with each Non-Executive 
Director his/her individual training and 
development needs.

Our new induction process
Under the guidance of the Chairman, the 
Company Secretary established a formal 
induction training process for new Directors 
who will receive an induction briefing from 
the Company Secretary on their duties 
and responsibilities as Directors of a 
listed Company.

Conflicts of interests
The duties to avoid potential conflicts and 
to disclose such situations for authorisation 
by the Board are the personal responsibility 
of each Director. All Directors are required 
to ensure that they keep these duties under 
review and to inform the Company Secretary 
on an ongoing basis of any change in their 
respective positions.
The Company’s conflict of interest procedures 
are reflected in its Articles of Association 
(Articles). In line with the Companies Act 
2006, the Articles allow the Directors to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts 
of interest, where appropriate. The decision 
to authorise a conflict can only be made 
by non-conflicted Directors. The Board 
considers conflicts or potential conflicts 
at each Board meeting.
The Articles require the Company to 
indemnify its officers, including officers 
of wholly owned subsidiaries, against liabilities 
arising from the conduct of ZPG’s business, 
to the extent permitted by law. ZPG has 
therefore purchased Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance during the year.

Board evaluation
In accordance with the provisions of the Governance Code, the Board carried out a 
formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees 
and individual Directors this year. The Board review involved three distinct processes.
Step 1: The Board commissioned an externally facilitated review carried out by the Center 
for Board Excellence (CBE) which involved the completion of a bespoke questionnaire, the 
results of which were analysed by CBE, which produced a formal written report to the Board, 
including a comparison of results with various peer groups. 
The questionnaire covered various areas including:
•  leadership of the Board;
•  ethics and accountability;
•  risk, financial monitoring and crisis control;
•  Board composition and culture, including balance of skill;
•  strategy;
•  effectiveness;
•  performance measures and remuneration; and
•  the Board’s relations with shareholders.
Step 2: At the end of a number of the Board meetings, the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors met without the Executive Directors present to discuss the Executive Directors’ 
performance during the meeting and the quality of the papers and to raise any concerns 
about the running of the business to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the Board and 
its processes.
Step 3: The Chairman met with each individual Non-Executive Director to evaluate his/her 
performance on a face-to-face basis to discuss his/her performance, identify any training 
needs and also to discuss the overall performance of the Board. Following these performance 
evaluations, it was concluded that all Directors possessed appropriate skill, experience, 
knowledge and expertise to be effective, and that they had all demonstrated commitment 
to the role. It was also concluded that all Directors had allocated sufficient time to the 
Company to discharge their responsibilities and duties effectively.
The consensus view from these three processes was that the Board and its Committees 
are operating effectively. Three specific development areas were identified: the need for 
continued focus and reporting, including detailed information relating to the cross-sell 
opportunities resulting from the acquisitions; ensuring that Management succession planning 
reflects the increased breadth of the Company; and ensuring that strategy sessions are more 
broadly focused. 
The SID, Duncan Tatton-Brown, together with the Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
evaluated the performance of the Chairman based upon input from other Board members.

Re-election of Directors
All directors of FTSE 350 companies 
should be subject to annual election 
by shareholders.
The Company’s next AGM will be held on 
30 January 2018. In accordance with the 
Governance Code, all Directors will be offering 
themselves up for election at the AGM to 
be held at the Company’s head office, full 
details of which are set out in the notice of 
meeting accompanying this Annual Report.
As noted above, following the formal internal 
evaluation process of the effectiveness of 
the Board, the Board is satisfied that each 
Director remains committed to his/her role 
and is competent to discharge his/her 
responsibilities as a member of the Board.

External appointments
During the year, Mike Evans announced his 
intention to step down from his position as 
the Chairman of Hargreaves Lansdown Plc. 
This will become effective once his successor 
is appointed following regulatory approval.
The Executive Directors may accept 
outside appointments provided that such 
appointments do not in any way prejudice 
their ability to perform their duties as 
Executive Directors of the Company.
Alex Chesterman is currently a Director 
of Devalink Limited, Hoopla Limited and 
Barcote Park Management Limited. None of 
these companies are part of the FTSE 100. 
Andy Botha is currently a Director of Geek 
Vintique Limited and Orange Grove Limited.

None of these companies are part of the 
FTSE 100. These appointments are not 
deemed to adversely impact the Directors’ 
ability to carry out their roles.
The Non-Executive Directors’ appointment 
letters anticipate a time commitment of 
10 days per year, recognising that there is 
always the possibility of an additional time 
commitment and ad hoc matters arising 
from time to time, particularly when the 
Company is undergoing a period of 
increased activity. The average time 
commitment inevitably increases where 
a Non-Executive Director assumes 
additional responsibilities such as being 
appointed to a Board Committee.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Relations with shareholders
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
that the views of the Company’s shareholders 
are communicated to the Board and he is 
assisted in this task by the Head of Investor 
Relations and the Company Secretary. 
Shareholders are able to communicate 
directly with the Company through the 
Company’s Head of Investor Relations 
and the Company Secretary, who report 
regularly back to the Board. Furthermore, 
as part of its investor relations programme, 
the Executive Directors have maintained 
an active dialogue with key stakeholders, 
including institutional investors, to discuss 
issues relating to the performance of ZPG 
including strategy and new developments. 
The CEO and CFO undertook investor 
roadshows around the UK and the US in 
December 2016 and June 2017. In addition 
to this, the Company hosted a number of 
product demonstrations and teach-ins at 
the Company’s head office throughout the 
year for investors to attend. This enabled 
them to review and understand the suite 
of new products that have been integrated 
into ZPG’s business following the various 
acquisitions. In this way, the Board was able 
to develop an understanding of the views 
of major shareholders about the Company. 
The Non-Executive Directors are always 
available to discuss any matter stakeholders 
might wish to raise.
After the end of the financial year, 
the Company consulted with its largest 
shareholders on proposals to change its 
Remuneration Policy, including an extension 
of the Value Creation Plan (VCP) for a further 
two years with a view to retaining the service 
of Alex Chesterman for a further period. 
This consultation was led by Sherry Coutu, 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
supported by the Company’s external 
advisers. More details on the extension 
of the VCP can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Investor relations activity and a review 
of the share register form an active part 
of the Board’s agenda. The Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors have attended, 
and are available to attend, investor relations 
meetings and have the ability to request 
meetings with investors or analysts 
independent of the Company’s 
Management, if required.

Product demonstration
The Company hosted a number of product demonstrations and teach-ins at the Company’s 
head office throughout the year for investors to attend.

Constructive use of the AGM
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with its shareholders and to encourage their 
participation. Therefore, separate resolutions on each substantially separate issue will 
be proposed and resolutions at the AGM will be conducted on a poll, enabling the views 
of the widest number of shareholders to be taken into consideration. For each resolution, 
proxy appointment forms will be provided to shareholders with the option to direct their 
proxy to vote on the resolutions or to withhold their vote.
The Board encourages shareholders to attend and vote at the AGM and the Company will 
be providing a facility for electronic proxy voting. The proxy forms which accompany this 
Annual Report contain further details on voting at the AGM.

Corporate governanceAudit Committee report

Chair of Audit Committee

“ This report describes the key 
tasks undertaken by the Audit 
Committee, its major areas of 
activity and how it discharged its 
responsibilities during the 2017 
financial year, with reference to 
the various requirements of the 
Governance Code.”

Introduction

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the 
Audit Committee report for 
the year. 

Stephen Daintith stepped down from the 
Board on 1 January 2017 and was replaced 
by James Welsh, who now acts as an 
observer on the Audit Committee as of the 
same date. There were no other changes 
to the composition of the Audit Committee 
from last year and the Audit Committee still 
consists of at least three Non-Executive 
Directors determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement 
and free from relationships or circumstances 
which may affect, or could appear to affect, 
the Directors’ judgement. 
Each member is considered to possess 
up-to-date and appropriate financial or 
accounting experience and continues to 
be independent for the purposes of the 
Governance Code. I am satisfied that the 
Audit Committee, as a whole, has sufficient 
competence relevant to the sectors in which 
ZPG operates. Biographies of the members 
of the Audit Committee are set out on 
pages 50 to 51.
The Audit Committee plays an important 
role in ensuring the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk 
management process. Under its terms 
of reference, which were updated this year, 
the Audit Committee is to assist the Board 
in fulfilling its financial oversight and audit 
responsibilities by:
•  monitoring the integrity of the 

Company’s financial statements; 

•  reviewing significant financial returns 

to regulators and any significant financial 
information contained in other documents; 

•  considering annually whether there should 
be an internal audit function and making 
a recommendation to the Board;

•  considering and making recommendations 

to the Board on the appointment, 
re-appointment, resignation or removal 
of the Company’s external auditor, to be 
put to shareholders for approval;

•  overseeing the selection process for and 

relationship with external auditor; and

•  reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness 

of the Company’s internal financial 
controls and internal control and risk 
management systems. 

We carried out an evaluation of the 
performance of the Audit Committee this 
year which concluded that it was effective, 
it maintained its independence and created 
constructive challenges, and it adequately 
covered financial reporting and judgements, 
risk management, compliance requirements 
and cyber security.
This report describes the key tasks 
undertaken by the Audit Committee, its 
major areas of activity and how it discharged 
its responsibilities during the 2017 financial 
year, with reference to the various 
requirements of the Governance Code. 
It will explain how the Audit Committee 
assessed external audit effectiveness and 
safeguards in relation to the provision of 
non-audit services by the Company’s auditor 
and the recommendations it provided to 
the Board, and it will refer to the significant 
issues that the Audit Committee considered 
in relation to the financial statements and 
how these issues were addressed.
I look forward to meeting with you at the 
Annual General Meeting in January 2018 to 
answer any further questions you may have 
about the work of the Audit Committee.

Duncan Tatton-Brown
Chair, Audit Committee

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Composition of the Audit Committee
There was one change to the composition 
of the Audit Committee during the year. 
Stephen Daintith, who was a Director 
appointed by DMGT and who was an 
observer on the Audit Committee, stepped 
down from the Board on 1 January 2017. 
James Welsh replaced Stephen as the 
DMGT observer on the Audit Committee 
as of the same date. The Company considers 
that the attendance of an observer at the 
Audit Committee meetings will not prejudice 
the independence or proper functioning 
of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee comprises four 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
It is chaired by Duncan Tatton-Brown, the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
and its other members are Sherry Coutu, 
Vin Murria and Robin Klein.
The Audit Committee remained in full 
compliance with Provision C.3.1 of the 
Governance Code throughout the year, 
which recommends that an audit committee 
should comprise at least three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. In addition to this, 
the provision requires at least one member 
of the Audit Committee to have recent and 
relevant financial experience. The Board 
considers that, by virtue of his current and 
former Executive and Non-Executive roles, 
Duncan Tatton-Brown possesses recent and 
relevant financial experience to comply with 
the requirements of the Governance Code. 
Due to the various experience and 
backgrounds of each of the Directors within 
the Audit Committee, including within the 
digital media, property and software sectors, 
the Board also considers that the Audit 
Committee as a whole possesses the 
competence relevant to the sector in which 
ZPG operates. Biographical details of the 
Directors on the Audit Committee, setting 
out their backgrounds and experiences, are 
laid out on pages 50 to 51.
The attendance of each member at the 
Audit Committee meetings is shown on 
page 55. The Chairman of the Company, 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer attend meetings of the 
Audit Committee by invitation, as do 
Deloitte LLP, the Company’s external 
auditor, and other members of Management 
or the Board as appropriate.

Roles and responsibilities
The principal function of the Audit Committee 
is to assist the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities with regard to financial 
reporting and to monitor the integrity of the 
financial statements of the Company and 
any formal announcements relating to the 

Company’s financial performance, 
reviewing any significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them, including 
reviewing and discussing the reports from 
the external auditor. 
It also reviews the Company’s internal 
financial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems and assists 
the Board in discharging its responsibilities 
with regard to internal audit (including 
considering annually whether there 
should be an internal audit function). 
The Audit Committee reviews and approves 
the annual audit plan and ensures that it 
is consistent with the scope of the audit 
engagement, reviewing and monitoring the 
extent of the non-audit work undertaken 
by the external auditor, advising on the 
appointment of the external auditor, 
overseeing the Company’s relationship 
with its external auditor and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 
It also reviews and monitors the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and 
approving the Annual Report and Accounts 
and the half-yearly reports remains with the 
Board; however, the Audit Committee gives 
due consideration to laws and regulations, 
the provisions of the Governance Code and 
the requirements of the Listing Rules.
The Audit Committee reviews the content 
of the Annual Report and Accounts and advises 
the Board on whether, taken as a whole, 
it is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Full reports and updates are provided to the 
Board throughout the year on how the Audit 
Committee has discharged its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee operates within agreed 
terms of reference and these were updated 
this year to reflect the latest requirements 
of the Governance Code, the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC) Audit Committee 
Guidance, the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
and the EU Audit Directive and Regulation. 
The full revised terms of reference for the 
Audit Committee have been published on 
the Company’s website (www.zpg.co.uk).
Under its terms of reference, the Audit 
Committee is required to meet at least 
three times in each year at appropriate 
times in the financial reporting and audit 
cycle. The Audit Committee followed the 
terms and met three times during the 
year. The attendance of each meeting 
is disclosed on page 55.

Activities of the Audit Committee
In May 2017, the Audit Committee was 
introduced to the Company’s new Risk 
and Internal Audit Manager, who had 
been hired to lead the ongoing work within 
the Company to ensure that controls are 
appropriately designed, fit for purpose 
and operating effectively across ZPG. 
Whilst the Company would continue to use 
third parties, where appropriate, to address 
high risk, specialist or focus areas, as 
appropriate, the Audit Committee believed 
that this hybrid approach was appropriate 
to address the existing levels of risk facing 
the businesses within ZPG and that the 
recruitment of a dedicated internal audit 
resource demonstrated Management’s 
intention to increase its focus and activities 
in this area. Following this introduction, the 
Risk and Internal Audit Manager was invited 
to attend all Audit Committee meetings 
throughout the year and to provide updates 
to the Audit Committee. 
At each Audit Committee meeting throughout 
the year, the Audit Committee considered 
updates to its risk management procedures 
to comply with the Governance Code. 
It also received updates from the Risk and 
Internal Audit Manager on ZPG’s internal 
controls and internal audit procedures. 
Further specific details of the Audit 
Committee’s agenda items are below.
•  On 24 November 2016, the Audit 

Committee met to discuss the full-year 
results for 2016; a risk management 
and internal audit update; a review by 
Deloitte, the Company’s auditor which 
also attended the meeting; a regulatory 
update and a cyber update from the 
Company’s Chief Technology Officer; 
and ZPG’s viability statement. 

•  On 22 May 2017, the Audit Committee 

reviewed the Company’s half-year 
results, a risk management and internal 
controls update, a cyber security review 
by the Company’s Chief Technology 
Officer, a regulatory update and the 
updated terms of reference.

•  On 6 July 2017, the Audit Committee met 
to consider the auditor’s FY17 Audit Plan, 
a risk management and internal audit 
update and the Audit Committee’s 
evaluation results, which concluded that 
the Audit Committee was operating 
effectively and adequately covered 
financial reporting and judgements, risk 
management, compliance requirements 
and cyber security. At the end of this 
meeting, the Audit Committee also 
discussed the effectiveness of Deloitte 
as ZPG’s auditor.

Corporate governanceActivities of the Audit Committee 
continued
•  On 22 November 2017, the Audit 

Committee reviewed and approved for 
consideration by the Board the financial 
results for the financial year ended 
30 September 2017. As part of that 
review process, the members of the 
Audit Committee reviewed the Annual 
Report, the adequacy of the disclosure 
with respect to reporting on a going 
concern basis and the viability statement, 
and whether the Annual Report taken 
as a whole was fair, balanced and 
understandable as set out below. 
The Audit Committee considered the 
appropriateness of preparing the accounts 
on a going concern basis and the viability 
of the Company, including consideration 
of forecast plans and supporting 
assumptions, and concluded that the 
Company’s financial position was such 
that it continued to be appropriate for 
accounts to be prepared on a going 
concern basis. The Company’s viability 
statement can be found on page 35. 

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Audit Committee reviewed a draft 
of the Annual Report 2017 and Management’s 
accompanying paper which considered the 
fair balanced and understandable nature 
of the report. In particular, the Committee 
considered internal consistency throughout 
the report, appropriate prominance of 
statutory and non-statutory measures, the 
accounting judgements and estimates and 
transparency of both good and bad events. 
The Audit Committee also received advice 
from external advisers during the drafting 
process in order to assist the Board in 
determining that the report is fair, balanced 
and understandable at the time that it was 
approved, and that it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. 

Significant issues considered in 
relation to the financial statements
The Audit Committee, together with the 
Executive Directors and ZPG’s external 
auditor, considered the following significant 
matters in relation to the financial statements 
and how these were addressed.
Revenue recognition
ZPG’s revenue recognition is limited in 
complexity; however, the addition of four 
new businesses during the Period increases 
the level of judgement. 

Audit Committee report continued

External auditor effectiveness review

Qualification 
and expertise

Resources

The Audit Committee considered whether the external 
auditor had appropriate resources and expertise to conduct 
the audit.

Independence 
and objectivity

Non-audit  
services

Planning and 
organisation

Quality

The Audit Committee received comments from the CFO 
and Management on the objectivity of the external auditor.

Non-audit services provided by Deloitte were reviewed and, 
as described below, are not considered to have affected the 
auditor’s independence.

The Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and 
organisation of the planning process for the audit and 
post-audit evaluation.

The Audit Committee also reviewed the quality of reporting 
from the external auditor and its recommendations.

For the Property division, the majority of 
revenue is derived from recurring subscriptions 
which are predictable in nature and invoiced 
monthly. The principal area of focus within this 
division relates to software revenues deriving 
from contracts with multiple obligations. 
Judgement is required in determining the 
fair value of multiple contractual obligations, 
principally the allocation of revenue to be 
recognised on installation and set-up, and 
that which relates to ongoing services. 
Management performed an exercise during 
the Period to demonstrate that any potential 
misallocation of fair value between installation 
and ongoing services could not be material. 
The external auditor has reviewed the 
results of this exercise.
Revenue for the Comparison division is 
recognised at the point at which a transaction 
or interaction on the Company’s website is 
completed and a lead is generated. An element 
of judgement is required in calculating 
a revenue accrual, which estimates the 
number of likely successful switches that 
will occur from the leads generated. 
Management performs a month-on-month 
analysis which demonstrates that the 
accuracy of accruals continues to improve 
over time. An analysis of post-year end 
receipts further supports the immaterial 
nature of any over or under accrual at the 
reporting date. 
The Audit Committee is therefore comfortable 
that the recognition of revenue during the 
Period is appropriate.

The acquisitions of 
Hometrack and ExpertAgent
During the year ZPG completed its 
acquisitions of Hometrack, ExpertAgent, 
Ravensworth and TechnicWeb. The process 
of determining the fair value of assets and 
liabilities acquired is inherently judgemental 
and there is a risk that inappropriate 
methodologies or assumptions could lead 
to a misstatement in the valuation of acquired 
assets and liabilities. The size of the Hometrack 
and ExpertAgent acquisitions means that 
the judgements involved are material to 
the Company’s consolidated results. 
The Hometrack acquisition also includes 
contingent consideration in the form of 
an earn-out. The value of the expected 
payment is highly uncertain and therefore 
there is a significant amount of judgement in 
the valuation of this potential liability at the 
acquisition date and its ongoing fair value.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the 
disclosure in the financial statements in 
relation to the acquisitions and has discussed 
the accounting for the transaction and the 
valuation of intangibles and other assets 
with both Management and the Company’s 
external auditor. The Audit Committee notes 
that a third party valuation specialist was 
engaged to assist with the purchase price 
allocation exercise. Certain inputs into the 
model, including forecast cash flows, are 
prepared by Management. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the judgements and estimates made by 
Management are appropriate and that these 
assumptions have been subject to sufficient 
review by the Company’s external auditor.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
The Group holds a significant amount of 
goodwill and intangible assets on the 
Statement of Financial Position as a result 
of acquisitions. These assets are subject to 
an annual impairment review, which requires 
an estimation of the recoverable value. 
As many of the assets have been acquired 
through recent acquisitions there is an 
increased risk if the acquired entities do 
not meet the projected forecasts identified 
at acquisition. The impairment analysis is 
performed using the Company’s three year 
plan for the expected future cash flows 
and the Audit Committee notes that this 
plan has been scrutinised by the Executive 
Team and approved by the Board. Other 
assumptions in the analysis, including the 
long-term growth rate and discount rate 
assumptions are in line with the 
expectations of the external auditor. 
The Audit Committee notes that although 
the available headroom is lower for the recent 
acquisitions as a result of the proximity of the 
impairment analysis to the initial recognition 
of the assets at fair value, available headroom 
exists for each cash-generating unit and the 
Audit Committee is comfortable that these 
assets are not impaired. The Committee 
further notes that a reasonable decrease 
in the forecasted cash flows for the 
Property Software Group could eliminate 
current headroom and that this sensitivity 
has been adequately disclosed in the 
financial statements. 
Revenue recognition, judgements around 
acquisitions and the impairment of goodwill 
and intangibles were each discussed with 
the Audit Committee at both the May and 
November 2017 Audit Committee meetings 
in the presence of the external auditor.

Assessment of effectiveness 
of the external audit process
ZPG’s current auditor is Deloitte LLP. 
Deloitte LLP was appointed as the Company’s 
auditor in 2012. The Audit Committee notes 
that FTSE 250 companies should put the audit 
out to tender at least every 10 years. To avoid 
significant disruption, the FRC has provided 
details of transitional arrangements which 
would mean that as Deloitte became the 
auditor after 2000, the Company would not 
need to undertake a tender review until 2020.

The Audit Committee oversees the 
relationship with ZPG’s external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP. Deloitte attends meetings 
of the Audit Committee by invitation and 
remains in constant communication with 
members of the Audit Committee, as well 
as the Executive Directors and other 
members of the Board, as appropriate. 
The Audit Committee also makes 
recommendations to the Board, for it to 
put to the shareholders for their approval 
at the AGM, in relation to the appointment 
of the external auditor and to approve the 
remuneration and terms of engagement 
of the external auditor. As part of this 
responsibility, the Audit Committee 
approved the audit plan for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 and reviewed 
the auditor’s findings and Management 
representation letters. Prior to recommending 
the appointment of Deloitte at the 
forthcoming AGM to the Board, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the external audit 
process, the performance of the auditor 
and its ongoing independence, objectivity 
and effectiveness, taking into account input 
from Management, responses to questions 
from the Audit Committee and the audit 
findings reported to the Audit Committee.
Based on this review, the Audit Committee 
concluded that the external audit process 
had been run efficiently and that Deloitte LLP 
has remained effective in its role as 
external auditor.

Approach to appointing the external 
auditor and how objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy 
covering the independence of the external 
auditor consistent with the ethical standards 
published by the Audit Practices Board and 
the engagement of the external auditor for 
the provision of non-audit services. This 
policy is available on the Company’s website 
(www.zpg.co.uk). This policy highlights the 
Audit Committee’s preference to engage 
with parties other than the external auditor, 
with regards to non-audit services, unless 
there is a considerable benefit to doing so 
and any activity is within the restrictions of 
all relevant legislation and ethical standards.

In accordance with proper standards, external 
auditors are required to adhere to a rotation 
policy whereby the audit engagement partner 
is rotated after five years. The previous audit 
engagement partner was appointed in 2012 
but, due to his previous role as the audit 
engagement partner for certain of the 
Company’s significant operations, could 
serve as the audit engagement partner for 
only two years after the Company became 
listed. Therefore, in accordance with 
independence requirements, a new audit 
engagement partner was appointed in the 
previous financial year. The Chair of the 
Audit Committee met with the new 
engagement partner on a regular basis 
throughout the year and the new 
engagement partner attended every 
Audit Committee meeting, along with 
her team, in the year.
The Audit Committee has authority to take 
independent advice as it deems appropriate 
in order to resolve issues on auditor 
independence. No such advice has been 
required to date.
The external auditor is also required periodically 
to assess whether, in its professional opinion, 
it is independent and those views are shared 
with the Audit Committee. It was concluded 
that the external auditor assessed itself to 
be independent.

Independence assessment 
by the Audit Committee
Based on the fact that the auditor and audit 
engagement partner rotation policy has been 
complied with, the Audit Committee is satisfied 
that the independence of the external auditor 
is not impaired. Furthermore, the level of 
fees paid for non-audit services does not 
jeopardise its independence. Audit and 
non-audit fees are set out in Note 5 to 
the financial statements.
The Audit Committee noted that the auditor 
has not provided any non-audit services, other 
than the interim review, during the Period.
The Audit Committee has assessed the 
performance and independence of the external 
auditor and recommended to the Board the 
re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor 
until the conclusion of the AGM in 2018.

Corporate governanceAudit Committee report continued

During the year, ZPG has continued to perform 
internal audit reviews as well as work with 
third parties to bring in independent 
specialist expertise. Audits conducted during 
the year include areas such as the control 
environment surrounding the Company’s 
new finance system, part of the customer 
billing process and cyber security. 
An internal audit plan for the 2018 financial 
year has now been created which was 
approved by the Audit Committee in 
November 2017.
It is expected that ZPG will continue to 
work with third parties, where appropriate, 
in order to obtain sufficient assurance on 
the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal controls. 

Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the overall 
system of internal controls for ZPG and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. In accordance 
with the FRC Internal Control: Guidance to 
Directors publication, it carries out a review 
of its suitability and effectiveness at least 
annually, covering all material controls including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems.
ZPG’s internal control framework is aligned 
to the “three lines of defence” model as set 
out on page 31.
The system of internal controls is designed 
to manage and diminish rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.

Internal audit
Provision C.3.6 of the Governance Code states 
that where there is no internal audit function 
within a company, the audit committee 
should consider annually whether there is a 
need for an internal audit function and make 
a recommendation to the board, with the 
reasons for the absence of such a function 
to be explained. 
Last year, the Audit Committee recommended 
to the Board that it was not necessary to 
appoint a permanent internal audit function 
but, rather, there should be a focus on specific 
areas supplemented with ad hoc reviews. 
However, as the Company has grown, 
Management, the Audit Committee and 
the Board recognise the value that a 
permanent internal audit function can 
provide in strengthening ZPG’s internal 
control framework.
As such, the decision was taken to recruit 
a Risk and Internal Audit Manager to 
continue to develop ZPG’s risk management 
framework and establish an in-house 
internal audit function. This role currently 
reports into Management and the Audit 
Committee considers this arrangement 
to be proportionate to the current level 
of risk and risk appetite of ZPG. 
An Internal Audit Charter (Charter) has been 
developed which reflects these arrangements 
and outlines the purpose and the respective 
responsibilities of the internal audit function 
and the Audit Committee. The Charter was 
approved by the Audit Committee at its 
July 2017 meeting. 
Management and the Audit Committee will 
assess the effectiveness of this arrangement 
and the internal audit function on an annual 
basis and the Audit Committee will continue 
to consider the need for an internal audit 
function independent from Management 
going forward.

During the year, ZPG carried out risk 
management workshops with key members 
of Management and the Executive 
Management Team. This involved rigorous 
identification, assessment and scrutiny of 
what are considered to be operational and 
strategic risks to the Company. The relevant 
key individuals contributed to the discussions 
involving these risks and the extensive 
feedback collected from the workshops 
was provided to the Audit Committee 
for consideration and review.
Further details of ZPG’s risk management 
framework and the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the business can be 
found on pages 31 to 35.
ZPG has operating policies and controls in 
place covering a range of issues including 
financial control and reporting, business 
continuity, information technology and 
security and appropriate employee policies. 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal controls and 
risk management and discharges its duties 
in this area by:
•  holding regular Board meetings to 
consider the matters reserved for 
its consideration;

•  receiving regular Management reports 

which provide an assessment of key 
risks and controls;

•  scheduling annual Board reviews 

of strategy including reviews of the 
material risks and uncertainties facing 
the business;

•  ensuring there is a clear organisational 
structure with defined responsibilities 
and levels of authority;

•  ensuring there are documented policies 

and procedures in place; and

•  scheduling regular Board reviews 
of financial budgets, forecasts and 
covenants with performance reported 
to the Board monthly.

Accountability
The Board is required to present a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of 
the Company’s financial position and prospects. 
The responsibilities of the Directors and 
external auditor are set out on pages 95 and 
103. As set out in the Directors’ report, the 
Directors consider the Company’s business 
to be a going concern. The Company’s 
viability statement can be found on page 35.

Duncan Tatton-Brown
Chair, Audit Committee

In reviewing the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls, the Audit Committee 
carries out the following duties:
•  reviews ZPG’s Company Strategic Risk 

Register (CSRR) compiled and maintained 
by Management within the various 
businesses of ZPG and questions and 
challenges where necessary;

•  regularly reviews the system of financial 

and accounting controls; and

•  reports to the Board on the risk and 
control culture within the Company.
In respect of ZPG’s financial reporting 
processes, the finance department is 
responsible for preparing its financial 
statements using a well-established 
consolidation process and ensuring that 
accounting policies are in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards. 
All consolidated financial information 
published by the Company is subject to 
recommendation by the Audit Committee 
to the Board for approval and external audit.
During the year, ZPG changed its finance 
system to accommodate the business 
growth with its functionality providing a 
significantly improved control environment 
in respect of key areas such as user access, 
monitoring and reporting. In addition, it has 
successfully migrated the customer billing 
process for portal services from the legacy 
built customer relationship management 
(CRM) system, to the new finance system. 
These projects were subject to internal audit 
review and any recommendations raised 
were tracked and followed up by ZPG’s 
internal audit function.
The integration of acquisitions into ZPG’s 
internal control environment continues to 
be an area of focus and is an area which 
features prominently within its internal 
audit plan for 2018. 
The Board, with advice from the Audit 
Committee, is satisfied that an effective 
system of internal controls and risk 
management is in place which enables the 
Company to identify, evaluate and manage 
key risks and which accord with the 
guidance provided by the FRC Internal 
Control: Guidance to Directors. 

Whistleblowing
ZPG has in place a whistleblowing policy, 
the “Speak-Up Policy”, which encourages 
employees to report any malpractice or 
illegal acts or omissions or matters of similar 
concern by other employees or former 
employees, contractors, suppliers or advisers 
using a prescribed reporting procedure. 
The policy facilitates the reporting of any 
ethical wrongdoing or malpractice or 
suspicion which may constitute ethical 
wrongdoing or malpractice. 
Examples include bribery, corruption, fraud, 
dishonesty and illegal practices which may 
endanger employees or third parties. There 
have been no instances of whistleblowing 
during the year under review.
This is facilitated through an independent 
and external organisation, SeeHearSpeakUp, 
which maintains a confidential hotline for all 
individuals within ZPG to report any 
malpractice or illegal acts or omissions or 
matters of similar concern. An email address 
is also provided and a reporting process on 
SeeHearSpeakUp’s website is available, both 
as alternative options to make such 
anonymous reports. 

Control environment
The Board is committed to business 
integrity, high ethical and moral values 
and professionalism in all its activities. 
ZPG has policies in place for:
•  anti-bribery and corruption;
•  working with third parties; 
•  gifts and entertainment; and
•  share dealing.
The Company is currently reviewing its 
payment practices and a report will be 
published next year in line with its obligations 
under the Reporting on Payment Practices 
and Performance Regulations 2017. The 
Company is also reviewing its practices and 
processes in order to ensure that reasonable 
prevention procedures are in place to 
prevent the facilitation of tax evasion in line 
with the new Criminal Finances Act 2017.

Corporate governanceNomination Committee report

Chair of Nomination Committee

“ This year, the Nomination 
Committee placed particular 
focus on succession planning 
within the Company and 
on compliance with the 
Governance Code in terms 
of Board composition.”

Introduction

Dear Shareholder
The Nomination Committee 
evaluates the balance of skills, 
experience, independence 
and knowledge on the Board. 
It leads the process for Board 
appointments and makes 
recommendations to the 
Board to meet the demands 
of the business.

This year, the Nomination Committee 
placed particular focus on succession 
planning within the Company and on 
compliance with the Governance Code 
in terms of Board composition. It has also 
worked hard to discharge its responsibilities 
by keeping under review the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board to ensure the orderly evolution 
of the membership of the Board and to 
make recommendations to the Board on 
composition and balance.
In this report, I explain how the Nomination 
Committee has discharged its responsibilities 
in greater detail.
The Nomination Committee operates 
within agreed terms of reference and these 
were updated this year to reflect the latest 
requirements of the Governance Code. 
The revised terms of reference for the 
Nomination Committee have been 
published on the Company’s website  
(www.zpg.co.uk).
Under its terms of reference, the 
Nomination Committee is required to meet 
at least twice in each year at appropriate 
times in the reporting and auditing cycle. 
The Nomination Committee followed the 
terms and met three times during the year.
As part of the externally facilitated annual 
Board evaluation this year, the performance 
of the Nomination Committee was reviewed. 
I am pleased to report that there were no 
areas of concern and the results of the 
evaluation showed that the Committee 
was operating effectively. 

Mike Evans
Chair, Nomination Committee

Composition
Mike Evans, the Chairman of the Board, 
is the Chair of the Nomination Committee. 
The other members are Alex Chesterman, 
Sherry Coutu, Robin Klein, Duncan 
Tatton-Brown and, from September onwards, 
Grenville Turner. Kevin Beatty, who is 
appointed to the Board of the Company as 
one of the two DMGT-nominated Directors, 
is an observer on the Nomination Committee.
Provision B.2.1 of the Governance 
Code recommends that a majority of the 
Nomination Committee be Non-Executive 
Directors, independent in character and 
judgement and free from any relationship 
or circumstance which may, could or would be 
likely to, or appear to, affect their judgement. 
As such, the Board considers that the 
Company complies with the Governance 
Code in this respect. The Company considers 
that the attendance of an observer at 
Committee meetings will not prejudice 
the independence or proper functioning 
of the Nomination Committee.

Roles and responsibilities
The Nomination Committee assists the Board 
in discharging its responsibilities relating to 
the composition and make-up of the Board 
and any Committees of the Board. It leads 
the process for Board appointments and 
makes recommendations to the Board.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for 
evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience and the size, structure and 
composition of the Board and Committees 
of the Board, retirements and appointments 
of additional and replacement Directors and 
Committee members and makes appropriate 
recommendations to the Board on such 
matters. It is also responsible for appropriate 
succession planning for both the Board and 
Management. The Nomination Committee 
has evaluated each Director and has 
recommended to the Board that there is 
an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience within the Board and that 
the size, structure and composition of the 
Board and its Committees are appropriate.

64 

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

In accordance with provision B.2.3 of the 
Governance Code, all Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed for three year terms subject 
to re-election and to statutory provisions 
relating to the removal of a Director. 
Having taken into account the value of ensuring 
that the membership of the Board and its 
various committees is refreshed and that 
undue reliance is not placed on particular 
individuals when making the decision to 
extend appointment periods and to maintain 
or rotate the membership of the Committees, 
the Company extended the appointments 
of Mike Evans, Duncan Tatton-Brown, 
Grenville Turner, Sherry Coutu and Robin Klein 
as their initial three year appointment terms 
were reached during the year. All appointments 
were extended by an additional three 
year period.
Details of each Director’s service agreement 
are set out in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on page 80.
The Nomination Committee’s terms of 
reference were updated this year to reflect 
the latest requirements of the Governance 
Code. The full terms of reference of the 
Nomination Committee are available on 
the Company’s website (www.zpg.co.uk).

Activities of the Nomination Committee
Last year, it was explained that the Company 
had applied all of the main principles and 
complied with all of the relevant provisions 
of the Governance Code with the exception 
of Provision B.1.2, which recommends that 
at least half of the Board of Directors of a 
UK-listed company, excluding the Chairperson, 
should comprise Non-Executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent. 
At the time, the Board comprised a 
Non-Executive Chairman and nine other 
Directors, of whom four were considered 
to be wholly independent. Therefore, the 
Company did not fully comply with the 
requirements of the Governance Code 
at the time and we set out our intention 
to explore avenues to resolve this one 
remaining non-compliant element in the 
current financial year.
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
carefully monitored and reassessed 
Grenville Turner’s independence. Following 
careful analysis accompanied by external 
professional advice, it was agreed that, since 
Grenville stepped down as the Chairman of 
Countrywide Plc, a customer and previously 
a major shareholder in the Company, in 
April 2016 and since Countrywide ceased 
to be a shareholder of the Company from 
September 2016 onwards, the Nomination 

Committee would recommend that the 
Board consider determining Grenville 
as independent for the purposes of the 
Governance Code from the conclusion 
of its Board meeting in July 2017 onwards. 
Further details of the Board's determination 
of Grenville's independence can be found 
in the Corporate Governance Statement 
on page 52. Following the Board’s approval, 
the Nomination Committee also recommended 
that Grenville be appointed as a member of the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
The only new appointment to the Board 
during the year was made under the terms 
of a relationship agreement (Relationship 
Agreement) with Daily Mail and General 
Trust Plc (DMGT), the ultimate parent of 
the Company’s current principal shareholder, 
DMGZ Limited (DMGZ). The main purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure 
that the Company and its subsidiaries are 
capable of carrying on their business 
independently of DMGT, that transactions 
and relationships with DMGT are at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms, 
and that the goodwill, reputation and 
commercial interests of the Company 
are maintained. Under the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement, DMGT can appoint 
two Directors to the Board, providing it 
ultimately holds more than 25% of the 
votes exercisable at general meetings of 
the Company, and one Director, providing 
it holds more than 10% of those votes. 
Stephen Daintith, who was a Director 
appointed by DMGT, stepped down from 
the Board on 1 January 2017. James Welsh 
replaced Stephen as a Director appointed 
by DMGT under the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement. For this reason, 
James’ appointment was dealt with by the 
Nomination Committee and it was not 
subject to the usual formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedures for the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board. However, 
James’ performance is subject to the Board’s 
formal and rigorous evaluation procedures.
The Company has continued to develop 
and refine its approach to succession planning 
within the Executive Directors and the 
Senior Management Team using performance 
and potential matrices. This is a well-developed 
process led by ZPG’s Chief Talent Officer, 
who presented succession planning material 
for the consideration of the Nomination 
Committee twice over the course of the year. 
The Executive Management of the 
Company has been strengthened following 
the acquisition of Hometrack, which 
resulted in a further addition to the 
Executive Management Team.

Diversity
The Company believes that diversity, 
including gender diversity, within ZPG is 
of paramount importance. This extends to 
diversity within the Board since, amongst 
other things, the Board believes it is 
important in ensuring effective engagement 
with key stakeholders, it leads to more 
effective decision making and it enhances 
the ability to deliver the Company’s business 
strategy, as well as being crucial to achieving 
better corporate governance.
The Board’s policy on diversity is to ensure 
that the Directors on the Board have a broad 
range of experience, skills and knowledge, 
with diversity of gender, culture, thinking 
and perspective. The Nomination Committee 
therefore gives careful thought to Board 
balance and diversity when making new 
appointments to the Board and the search 
for Board candidates is conducted, and 
appointments to the Board are always made, 
on merit against objective criteria, having 
regard to the benefits of diversity, including 
gender diversity, on the Board.
The Board, which consists of two female 
Directors (20% of the Board), endorses the 
aspirations of the Davies Review on Women 
on Boards, and is currently in line with the 
recommendations contained in this review. 
The Hampton-Alexander Review has now 
recommended a voluntary target of a minimum 
of 33% female representation on FTSE 350 
boards by 2020 and, although the Board 
has not committed to any specific gender 
or diversity targets, it will give due regard 
to this target going forward.
The Board will continue to engage executive 
search firms which have signed up to the 
voluntary code of conduct setting out the 
seven key principles of best practice to abide 
by throughout the recruitment process and 
will continue to follow a policy of appointing 
talented people at every level to deliver 
high performance.
For further information on diversity within 
ZPG, see the Our People and Corporate 
Social Responsibility section on page 44.

Corporate governanceDirectors’ remuneration report

Chair of Remuneration Committee

“ The Company has seen another 
year of growth, both organically 
and through acquisition, and we 
welcome TechnicWeb, Hometrack, 
ExpertAgent, Ravensworth and, 
subsequent to the year-end, 
Money to the Company.”

Introduction

Dear Shareholder
As the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee, 
I am pleased to present 
the Directors’ remuneration 
report for the year ended 
30 September 2017, which 
has been prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee 
(‘‘Committee’’) on behalf 
of the Board.

The Company has seen another year of growth, 
both organically and through acquisition, 
and we welcome TechnicWeb, Hometrack, 
ExpertAgent, Ravensworth and, subsequent 
to the year-end, Money to the Company. 
During the Period the Company has seen 
Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increase 
by 46.8 million and 19.3 million compared 
to the prior year and at the same time we 
have seen Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
for the Period of 13%, delivering value 
of over £175 million to shareholders.
The Company’s strong performance is 
reflected in the remuneration for the Period 
as we continue to incentivise and reward 
the Executive Directors, Management and 
employees throughout the business based 
on the underlying financial performance 
of the Company. 
2017 also marks the third anniversary 
of the ZPG’s IPO and alongside it the end 
of the first vesting period for the Company’s 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which was 
awarded to both Executive Directors and 
Management. The LTIP represents just one 
of the plans which aim to align individual 
performance and reward with the long-term 
strategy and objectives of the business and 
I am pleased to announce the vesting of this 
award in line with the Company’s excellent 
performance in the three years since IPO.
In January 2017 we also made the first 
grant of the nil-cost options under the Value 
Creation Plan (VCP) to the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer. The award demonstrates 
the outstanding value created for shareholders 
over the first measurement period of the Plan 
to December 2016 with over £437 million 
of total shareholder return generated. 

The Committee believes that the VCP is 
meeting its objectives. The total number 
of options banked under the VCP in FY17 
at the first measurement date can be found 
on page 88. 

Continued retention of our CEO
The Remuneration Committee believes 
that in order to maintain the Company’s 
commitment of creating value for our 
shareholders, the presence and active 
involvement of our CEO will be pivotal in 
the near to medium term. With the current 
VCP term now ending in less than two years, 
the Company has been looking for the ways 
to ensure continued retention and motivation 
of the CEO. As the VCP format has proven 
to be effective thus far in its goals of 
encouraging value generation and lock-in 
of the CEO, after careful consideration 
the Committee has decided to propose 
an extension of the plan for a further two 
year period starting from 2019, subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM. 
The key changes proposed to the VCP include:
•  the reduction in the CEO’s share in the 
return above the hurdle from 3% to 2% 
for the extended term of the VCP; and

•  a proportional increase of the maximum 
number of shares which can be earned 
under the Plan (whether new issue or 
market purchased) from 7.5 million to 
11.25 million to take into account the 
two additional years. 

Detailed terms of the extension to the VCP 
are outlined in Notice of the Annual General 
Meeting and the Remuneration Policy 
section of this report.

Changes in regulation and market practice
The Remuneration Committee continues 
to keep abreast of ongoing changes in both 
regulation and market practice with regards 
to Executive remuneration including, but 
not limited to, the Green Paper on Corporate 
Governance and Executive Pay issued by 
the Department for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy in November 2016 and 
the Government’s subsequent response to 
the comments raised on the Green Paper. 
The Committee will continue to consider the 
recommendations and impact on the Policy 
in this, and other, regulations and governance 
changes as they develop.

66 

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

The Committee intends for this updated 
Remuneration Policy to be in effect for 
three years with the next new policy to 
be presented for shareholder vote in 2021. 
However, the Committee will continue 
to review the compensation practices to 
ensure that the policy is effective, fit for 
purpose and supports the Company’s 
strategy on an ongoing basis.

Proposed changes to Remuneration Policy
With the exception of the extension to the 
VCP, the Committee is not proposing to 
make any material changes to the Policy 
that was approved by shareholders in 2015. 
The following changes are proposed to bring 
elements of the policy in line with current 
prevailing corporate governance standards:
•  formally introducing a two year holding 
period post vesting for the LTIP which 
will apply to future LTIP awards; and

•  increasing the shareholding guideline for 
Executive Directors (excluding the CEO 
where the guideline will remain at 400% 
of salary) to 200% of salary (currently 
100% of salary).

Remuneration Committee decisions 
made in the 2017 financial year
During the year the Committee made the 
following decisions:
•  Review of the remuneration package for 
2018 for the Company’s CEO and CFO 
as set out below:
•  salaries of £537,500 and 
£320,000 respectively;

•  pension contributions of up to 15% 

of salary;

•  bonuses of up to 150% and 125% 

of salary respectively;

•  continued participation under the 

VCP for the CEO; 

•  proposed two year extension to 
the original period of the VCP; 

•  award under the LTIP for 2017 of 
150% of salary for the CFO; and

•  increase in shareholding requirement 
for Executive Directors other than the 
CEO to 200% of salary (CEO remains 
at 400% of salary).

•  The Committee considered the base 
salaries for the Executive Directors.
•  The salaries above represent 
an increase of 5.39% for the 
CEO and 16.4% for the CFO. 
•  The increase for the CEO was 

made as part of an annual review 
in line with the budgeted average 
increase for employees. 

•  The increase for the CFO 
encompasses the annual 
adjustment for all employees 
of 6% plus ongoing adjustment to 
bring the CFO’s salary in line with 
ZPG’s targeted market positioning 
as he grows in the role and based 
on his performance to date.

•  The new salaries remain below the 

median levels for the FTSE 250.

•  The fee of the Chairman of the Company 
was increased from £183,750 to £193,000 
for 2018 (a rise of 5.03% in line with the 
budgeted increase for all employees). 
There were no changes to Non-Executive 
Director fees. The fee rise to the Chairman 
was to reflect the increase in responsibility 
due to the Company’s increase in size 
and complexity and is in line with the 
remuneration policy.

•  2017 annual bonuses of 135% of salary 
for the CEO and 112% of salary for the 
CFO which corresponded to 90% of 
maximum opportunity, recognising the 
strong financial performance of the 
Company and the personal performance 
of the Executive Directors over the year.
•  2017 awards under the LTIP for the CFO 
and Management in line with the normal 
award policy. Further details of the 
awards for the CFO are on page 83.

•  Award under the VCP in January 2017 

under the rules of this Plan. Detail of the 
award for the CEO is set out on page 83.

Further details on how our Remuneration 
Policy will be applied in practice for the 2018 
financial year are set out on pages 70 to 72.

Key activities of the Committee
The Committee’s key activities during the 
2017 financial year were:
•  reviewing the remuneration package 

for the CEO and CFO for 2017 and the 
implementation for 2018 to ensure that 
they remain appropriate and aligned 
with the Company strategy; 

•  reviewing Executive Director base 

salary levels;

•  making awards under the Company’s 

LTIP for Executive Directors and 
Management and assessing targets;

•  reviewing the Company’s TSR performance 

and adjusted EPS performance against 
target in respect of the Company’s first 
LTIP vesting which was awarded in 2014;

•  making an award under the VCP for 

the CEO; 

•  determining the level of bonus payments 

in respect of this financial year;

•  Reviewing the cascade and appropriateness 
of share plans across the wider business;

•  drafting the Company’s Directors’ 

remuneration report; and

•  Re-appointment of PwC as remuneration 

advisers for 2018.

Remuneration report

In this section, we summarise the purpose of our Remuneration Policy (the Policy) 

and its linkage to our corporate strategic objectives and we highlight the 

performance and remuneration outcomes for 2017. More detail can be found 

in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Our principles of remuneration
•  There should be a strong link between an individual’s reward and the performance of the Company to align the interests of Management 

with those of shareholders.

•  Variable remuneration makes up a significant proportion of the remuneration package.
•  Stretching performance conditions directly aligned with the Company’s strategy. The Company’s strategy is laid out on pages 15 to 19. 

The Company’s mission is to be the platform of choice for consumers and partners engaged in property and household decisions.

Summary of changes to Remuneration Policy
With the exception of the extension to the VCP, the Committee is not proposing to make any material changes to the Policy that was 
approved by shareholders in 2015. The changes proposed aim to bring elements of the Policy to be in line with the current prevailing 
corporate governance standards.

Long Term Incentive Plan  
(LTIP)

Introduction of formal post vesting holding period of two years on future grants of LTIP awards. Previously it 
was at the discretion of the Committee to decide if an additional holding period was implemented.

Value Creation Plan (VCP)

Extension of the term of the 2015 Value Creation Plan for a further two year period to 2021.
The original grant gave the CEO the potential right to earn nil-cost options over shares in the Company 
equal to 3% of the total value created for shareholders above a hurdle of 8% p.a. at the end of each 
Plan Year over a four year performance period. A minimum return of 8% p.a. must be maintained at 
each vesting date for the award to vest. The vesting schedule for the original grant provides that 50% 
of the cumulative balance of options will vest and may be exercised at the end of the third Plan Year 
with 100% of the cumulative number of options vesting at the end of the fourth Plan Year.
The extension of the VCP gives the CEO the potential right to earn nil-cost options over shares in the 
Company equal to 2% of the total value created for shareholders above a hurdle of 8% p.a. at the end 
of each plan year for the two year extension period. There will be an additional vesting period with 50% 
of the options earned in year 5 vesting at the end of the fifth Plan Year with the balance of options from 
year 5 and those earned under year 6 vesting at the end of sixth Plan Year. In order for the nil-cost 
options to vest, the minimum 8% return p.a. has to be achieved at each vesting date.
The maximum number of shares which can be earned under the Plan (whether new issue or market 
purchased) will increase proportionally from 7.5 million to 11.25 million to take into account the two 
additional years. 

Minimum shareholding 
requirement

The minimum shareholding requirement for Executive Directors has been increased to 200% of salary 
from 100% of salary.
The CEO will be required to hold his minimum shareholding requirement of 400% of his salary for one 
year following the cessation of his employment.

OPERATION OF ELEMENT IN 2018

The salary for the CEO has increased from £510,000 by £27,500 to £537,500 and the salary for the CFO has 
increased from £275,000 by £45,000 to £320,000.
The increase for the CEO was made as part of an annual review in line with the budgeted average increase for 
employees of 6%.
The increase for the CFO encompasses the annual adjustment for all employees of 6% plus ongoing adjustment 
to bring the CFO’s salary in line with ZPG’s targeted market positioning as he grows in the role and based on his 
performance to date.
The new salaries remain below the median levels for the FTSE 250.
There are no proposed changes to benefits and pensions from the financial year ending 30 September 2017.
The fee for the Chairman was also reviewed resulting in an increase of £9,250 from £183,750 to 193,000 per annum. 
The increase is broadly in line with the level of increase for our employees and in line with the Remuneration Policy.
There have been no increases to the fees for non-executive directors from the rates set in 2017.

OPERATION OF ELEMENT IN 2018

Annual Bonus Plan

The maximum opportunity for the CEO and CFO are unchanged at 150% and 125% of salary respectively. The bonus 
which can be earned for “target” performance is 60% of the maximum bonus.
Operation of the plan:
•  50% of any bonus earned will be paid in cash; and
•  50% of any bonus earned will be paid in shares which vest after a further three years subject to the Executive 

Director’s continued employment.

Performance conditions for the 2018 financial year and their weighting are as follows:
•  EBITDA (50%);
•  revenue (30%); and
•  personal strategic objectives (20%).
Further details of the targets applicable to the bonus for the coming year are considered by the Committee to be 
commercially sensitive as they are the key metrics that are critical to the operation of the Company. The Committee 
will provide full retrospective disclosure of the performance targets for the financial measures to allow shareholders 
to judge the bonus earned in the context of the performance delivered in the Annual Report on Remuneration next 
year. The outcomes of the 2017 bonus are provided on page 85.

Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)

The CEO is not granted awards under the LTIP, since the introduction of the VCP (below) on 1 October 2015.
The maximum opportunity for the CFO is unchanged at 150% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the EPS target range for LTIP awards to be granted in respect 
of FY2018. It is the Committee’s view that the threshold and maximum level of EPS growth rates at 10% to 18% 
compound average growth rate remains appropriate.
The vesting earned at threshold performance has been maintained at 25%. There are no changes to the TSR 
performance targets. Awards will be subject to additional two year holding period post vesting.

Value Creation Plan 
(VCP)

The VCP for the current CEO will enter its third year since approval by shareholders on 1 October 2015. An update on 
the performance of the VCP and the number of options banked at the first measurement date are provided on page 88.

Share Incentive Plan 
(SIP)

Matching Shares will continue to be granted on a monthly basis for each Partnership Share purchased by an 
eligible employee.

Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Policy report sets out the remuneration policy that will governs the Company’s future remuneration payments. 
The policy is intended to apply for three years following the shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM on 30 January 2018. 
The Committee determines the Policy for the Executive Directors, the Chairman and other Management for current and future years and this 
is reviewed on an annual basis. The Policy is designed to support the strategic objectives of the Company and to allow the business to recruit, 
retain and incentivise the quality of Management needed to shape and execute our strategy to deliver sustained shareholder value over the 
long term.
The Policy aims to align the interests of the Executive Directors, Management and employees to the long-term interests of shareholders and 
aims to support a high performance culture with appropriate reward for superior performance, without creating incentives that will encourage 
excessive risk taking or unsustainable performance. The Committee considers that a successful policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take 
account of future changes in the Company’s business environment and in its remuneration practice.
The Policy is designed around the following key principles: 
•  ensure a strong link between an individual’s reward and the performance of the Company to align the interests of Senior Management 
with those of shareholders. In achieving this principle the Committee has ensured that the performance elements of the remuneration 
are transparent and stretching; 

•  maintain a competitive package against businesses of a comparable size in the FTSE 250 and comparable peer group businesses in 

the sector with reference to the breadth of the role and experience the role holder brings to the Company; 

•  operate a consistent reward and performance philosophy throughout the business; 
•  encourage a material, personal stake in the business and a long-term focus on sustained growth through long-term shareholding; 
•  provide a balanced package with a focus on variable pay; and 
•  take into account the associated risks of each aspect of remuneration.
The Committee is satisfied that its approach to the Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed to promote the long-term success of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will review annually the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and key Management drawing 
on trends and adjustments made to all employees across the Company and taking into consideration the:
•  business strategy over the Period; 
•  overall corporate performance; 
•  market conditions affecting the Company; 
•  changing practice in the markets where the Company competes for talent; and
•  changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Discretion 
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this Policy. The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative 
discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend 
the Policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await 
shareholder approval. 

Differences in policy from the wider employee population 
The Company aims to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is market competitive and operates the same core structure 
as for the Executive Directors. The Company operates employee share and variable pay plans, with pension provisions provided for all 
Executives and employees. In addition, any salary increases for Executive Directors are expected to be generally in line with those for 
UK-based employees.

Salary

Provides a base level of remuneration 
to support recruitment and retention 
of Executive Directors with the 
necessary experience and expertise 
to deliver the Company’s strategy.

Whilst there is no maximum salary level 
or salary increase level, to reflect the 
Committee’s wish to ensure that fixed 
costs are minimised it is intended that 
salaries will not exceed the median level 
relative to the current comparator group  
of companies.
The companies in the comparator group 
are the constituents of the FTSE 250 
Index. The Committee intends to review 
the list of companies each year and may 
add or remove companies from the group 
as it considers appropriate. Any changes  
to the comparator group will be disclosed 
in the part of the report setting out the 
operation of the policy for the future year.
In general salary rises to Executive Directors 
will be in line with the rise to employees.
The Company will set out, in the section 
headed statement of implementation 
of remuneration policy in the following 
financial year, the salaries for that year 
for each of the Executive Directors 
(see page 84).

An Executive Director’s basic salary 
is set on appointment and reviewed 
annually or when there is a change 
in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level 
of salary, the Committee considers:
•  remuneration practices within 

the Company;

•  the performance of the individual 

Executive Director;

•  the individual Executive Director’s 

experience and responsibilities;

•  the general performance 

of the Company;

•  salaries within the ranges paid by the 
companies in the comparator group 
used for remuneration benchmarking 
(when the Committee determines 
it is appropriate to carry out a 
benchmarking exercise);

•  pay and conditions throughout 

the Company. The Committee has 
access to pay and conditions of other 
employees within the Company when 
determining remuneration for the 
Executive Directors and also considers 
the relationship between general 
changes to pay and conditions within 
the Company as a whole; and

•  the economic environment.
Individuals who are recruited or 
promoted to the Board may, on 
occasion, have their salaries set below 
the targeted policy level until they 
become established in their role. In such 
cases subsequent increases in salary 
may be higher than the average until 
the target positioning is achieved.

Benefits

Provides a benefits package in 
line with standard market practice 
relative to its comparator group to 
enable the Company to recruit and 
retain Executive Directors with the 
experience and expertise to deliver 
the Company’s strategy.

Pensions

Provides a pension provision in line 
with the comparator group to enable 
the Company to recruit and retain 
Executive Directors with the 
experience and expertise to deliver 
the Company’s strategy.

The Executive Directors can receive 
family private health cover, car 
allowance and death in service 
life assurance.
The Committee recognises the need 
to maintain suitable flexibility in the 
benefits provided to ensure it is able 
to support the objective of attracting 
and retaining personnel in order to 
deliver the Company strategy. Additional 
benefits may therefore be offered such 
as relocation allowances on recruitment.
Executive Directors shall be reimbursed 
for all reasonable expenses and the 
Company may settle any tax incurred 
in relation to these.
The maximum will be set at the cost 
of providing the benefits described. 

Employer retirement funding is 
determined as a percentage of gross 
basic salary, up to a maximum limit of 
15%. Where this exceeds the maximum 
annual pension contribution that can 
benefit from tax relief or the Lifetime 
Allowance, any excess may be provided 
in the form of a salary supplement, 
which would not itself be pensionable 
or form part of salary for the purposes 
of determining the extent of participation

PERFORMANCE METRICS

•  The Plan provides an 

• 

incentive to the Executive 
Directors linked to 
achievement in delivering 
goals that are closely 
aligned with the Company’s 
strategy and the creation 
of value for shareholders.
In particular, the Plan 
supports the Company’s 
objectives allowing the 
setting of annual targets 
based on the businesses’ 
strategic objectives at that 
time, meaning that a wider 
range of performance 
metrics can be used that 
are relevant and achievable.

•  The Committee has 

discretion to defer part 
of the annual bonus earned 
in shares under the Deferred 
Annual Bonus Plan. The 
advantage of deferral is:
•  ongoing risk adjustment 

due to the link to the 
share price over the 
deferral period thereby 
driving long-term 
strategic behaviours; and

•  amounts deferred 
in shares are also 
forfeitable on an 
Executive Director’s 
voluntary cessation 
of employment which 
provides an effective 
lock-in.

The Company operates in a 
rapidly changing sector and 
therefore the Committee may 
change the balance of the 
measures, or use different 
measures for subsequent 
financial years, as appropriate, 
to reflect this. This is subject 
to the condition that at least 
50% of the award is based on 
financial performance.
The Company will set out 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration in the following 
financial year, the nature of 
the target measures and their 
weighting for each year 
(see page 86).
Details of the performance 
measurements and their level 
of satisfaction for the year 
being reported on will be 
set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
The Committee can determine 
that part of the bonus earned 
under the Annual Bonus Plan 
is provided in the form of an 
award of shares under the 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan. 
The maximum value of 
deferred shares is 50% 
of the bonus earned.
The main terms of these 
awards are:
•  minimum deferral period  

of three years; and

•  the participants’ continued 

employment at the end 
of the deferral period.
The Committee has the 
discretion to apply a two year 
holding period post vesting 
of deferred shares.
The Committee may award 
dividend equivalents on those 
shares to Plan participants to 
the extent that they vest.
The DBP contains malus 
and clawback provisions.

The Committee will determine 
the maximum annual 
participation in the Plan for 
each year, which for the CEO 
will not exceed 150% of salary 
and for the other Executive 
Directors will not exceed 
125% of salary.
Below threshold level of 
performance 0% of the bonus 
will be earned. At threshold 
level of performance 25% 
of the bonus will be earned. 
At target level of performance 
for the CEO 60% of the bonus 
will be earned and for the other 
Executive Directors 75% of 
the bonus will be earned. At 
105% of target performance 
100% of the bonus will be 
earned (the maximum). The 
Committee retains discretion 
to change the calibration of 
bonus targets.
The annual bonus will be paid 
in cash and deferred shares. 
For Executive Directors 50% 
of annual bonus to be paid 
immediately in cash and 50% 
deferred into shares.

The Plan is based on a mix 
of financial and strategic/
operational conditions and 
is measured over a period 
of one financial year. The 
financial measures will 
account for no less than 50% 
of the bonus opportunity.
The Committee retains 
discretion in exceptional 
circumstances to:
•  change performance 

measures and targets and 
the weightings attached 
to performance measures 
part-way through a 
performance year if there 
is a significant and material 
event which causes the 
Committee to believe 
the original measures, 
weightings and targets 
are no longer appropriate.

In cases where the Committee 
believes that the bonus 
outcome is not a fair and 
accurate reflection of business 
performance, make downward 
or upward adjustments to the 
amount of bonus earned.
Any adjustments or discretion 
applied by the Committee  
will be fully disclosed in the 
follow year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Details of the performance 
conditions, targets and their 
level of satisfaction for the 
year being reported on will 
be set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Should the Committee 
determine that one or more 
targets are commercially 
sensitive, these will be 
disclosed in subsequent 
years’ remuneration reports 
once commercial sensitivity 
ceases to apply.

The use of adjusted EPS

The CEO does not participate

Awards are granted 
annually to Executive 
Directors. These will vest  
at the end of a three year

•  the Executive Director’s 
continued employment 
at the date of vesting; 
and

•  satisfaction of the 

performance conditions.
The Committee may award 
dividend equivalents on 
awards to the extent that 
these vest.
Awards made under  
the LTIP will be subject 
to an additional two year 
post vesting holding  
period, applicable to the  
net number of shares 
received after tax and 
other statutory deductions. 
The LTIP contains malus 
and clawback provisions.

The performance conditions for awards 
are currently adjusted EPS1 growth and 
TSR. EPS growth for this purpose is 
defined as the increase in adjusted  
basic EPS. 
The Company operates in a rapidly 
changing sector and therefore the 
Committee may change the balance of 
the measures, or use different measures 
for subsequent awards, as appropriate. 
No material change will be made to the 
type of performance measures without 
prior shareholder consultation. Details of 
the performance conditions for grants 
made in the year will be set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration and 
for future grants in the statement of 
implementation of remuneration policy  
in the future financial year. 
In exceptional circumstances the 
Committee retains the discretion to 
change the performance measures and 
targets and the weighting attached to 
the performance measures and targets 
part-way through a performance period 
if there is a significant and material event 
which causes the Committee to believe 
the original measures, weightings and 
targets are no longer appropriate;
make downward or upward adjustments 
to the amount of LTIP award vesting 
resulting from the application of the 
performance measures, if the 
Committee believe that the vesting 
outcomes are not a fair and accurate

Any adjustments or discretion applied by 
the Committee will be fully disclosed in

earned for achieving the  
8% p.a. return with respect 
to the original VCP term;
•  nil-cost options equal to  

3% of the return generated 
above 8% p.a. for the initial 
four year VCP period 
(additional nil-cost options 
will only accrue once 
£5,000,000 has been 
exceeded);

•  nil cost options equal to 

2% of the return generated 
above 8% p.a. for the two 
year extended period; and
•  the cap on the VCP will be 

increased to 11.25 million 
shares to take into account 
the extension of the VCP 
for two further years. 

An incentive which aligns the 
CEO with the outputs of the 
successful implementation 
of the Company’s strategy, 
based on total shareholder 
return generated.

Value Creation 
Plan (VCP)
A full 
description 
of the detailed 
terms and 
conditions 
attached to 
the VCP are 
set out in the 
2018 Notice  
of Annual 
General 
Meeting. 

Under the VCP, the CEO will be granted 
a conditional award giving him the potential 
right to earn ordinary shares of the 
Company based on the absolute total 
shareholder return generated over the 
VCP performance period.
The original award gave the CEO the 
opportunity to share in 3% of the total 
value created for shareholders above 
a hurdle (“Threshold Total Shareholder 
Return”) measured shortly after the end 
of each VCP Plan Year (“Measurement 
Date”) over the four year VCP 
performance period.
The extension to the VCP gives the 
CEO an opportunity to share in 2% 
of the total value created for shareholders 
above a Threshold Total Shareholder 
Return for an additional two years by 
extending the VCP performance period 
to six years.
For the original grant 50% of the 
cumulative number of nil-cost options 
will vest and may be exercised following 
the Measurement Date following the 
end of the third Plan Year with 100% 
of the cumulative number of nil-cost 
options vesting following the Measurement 
Date following the end of the fourth 
Plan Year. This vesting schedule will 
continue for the original award. For the 
extension there will be an additional 
vesting period with 50% of the options 
earned in year 5 vesting at the end of 
the fifth Plan Year with the balance of 
options from year 5 and those earned 
under year 6 vesting at the end of the 
sixth Plan Year.
In all cases the minimum return of 8% 
p.a. has to be maintained over the VCP 
period or earned nil-cost options will  
not vest and/or will lapse.
The VCP contains malus and 
clawback provisions.

To encourage company-wide 
employee share ownership 
and thereby align employees’ 
interests with shareholders.

OPERATION

OPPORTUNITY

UK plan in line with HMRC 
limits as amended from time 
to time.

The Company operates a share incentive 
plan in which the Executive Directors 
are eligible to participate (which is 
HMRC approved and is open to all 
eligible employees).
The Company retains the discretion to 
introduce additional plans, and to make 
Directors eligible for these as appropriate.

PERFORMANCE
METRICS

There are no 
performance

an all-employee plan.

Minimum shareholding requirement
The Remuneration Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines that will encourage the Executive Directors to build up, over a five year 
period and then subsequently hold, a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary. Adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued 
participation in the equity incentive arrangements. This Policy ensures that the interests of Executive Directors and those of shareholders are closely 
aligned. The minimum shareholding requirements will be 400% for the CEO and 200% for the other Executive Directors. The Committee retains the 
discretion to increase these shareholding guidelines during the Policy period. The CEO will be required to hold his minimum shareholding requirement 
of 400% of his salary for one year following the cessation of his employment.

Recruitment policy 
The Company’s principle is that the remuneration of any new Director will be assessed in line with the same principles as for the Executive 
Directors, as set out in the Remuneration Policy table. The Remuneration Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more 
than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role from the market in which the Company 
competes. The Remuneration Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred 
candidate and will have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one off or enhanced short-term or long-term incentive 
payments made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award. The Company’s detailed 
policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of new Directors is summarised in the table below:

ELEMENT OF 
REMUNERATION

RECRUITMENT POLICY

Salary

Benefits

Pensions

Salary will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors.

The standard benefit package for existing Executive Directors will apply.

The maximum employer contribution will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive Directors.

Annual Bonus and 
Deferred Bonus Plans

Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive Directors and will not 
exceed 150% of salary for CEO and 125% of salary for all other Executive Directors.

LTIP

Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive Directors and will not 
exceed 200% of salary.

Maximum variable pay 
(incentive opportunity)

In the year of recruitment, the maximum variable pay will be 350% of salary for CEO and 325% of salary for all other 
Executive Directors.

Buyout of incentives 
forfeited on cessation 
of employment

The Committee’s policy is not to provide buyouts as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee determine that the individual circumstances of recruitment justified the provision of a 
buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of a Director’s previous employment will 
be calculated taking into account the following:
•  the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Director’s cessation of employment;
•  the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them being satisfied; and
•  any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (lapsed value).
The Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the Company’s incentive 
plans. To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buyout within the terms of the Company’s existing 
incentive plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used.

Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would 
be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. Accordingly, prevailing 
elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the person 
concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the Directors’ remuneration report for the relevant financial year. 
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director is to apply the policy which 
applies to the current Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.

The Committee’s policy for setting notice periods is that a 12 month period will apply for Executive Directors. The Committee may, in exceptional 
circumstances arising on recruitment, allow a longer period which would, in any event, reduce to 12 months following the first year of employment.
The Non-Executive Directors of the Company (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts and are appointed by letters of appointment. 
Each Independent Non-Executive Director’s term of office runs for a three year period. The Company extended the appointments of those 
Non-Executive Directors where their three year appointment terms were reached during the year. These were extended by an additional 
three year period.
The Company follows the UK Corporate Governance Code’s recommendation that all Directors be subject to annual re-appointment by shareholders. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting).

External Non-Executive Directorships
Executive Directors may hold positions in other companies as Non-Executive Directors and retain fees. The Executive Directors did not hold 
positions in any other company during the period.

Payment for loss of office
The Committee will honour Executive Directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses. 
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are 
no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no 
agreement between the Company and its Executive Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in 
good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or 
compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment. When determining 
any loss of office payment for a departing individual the Remuneration Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst 
seeking to address the circumstances at the time.

Performance conditions will be measured at the date 
of the change of control. The bonus will normally be 
prorated to the date of the change of control.

The Committee has discretion:
•  to continue the operation of the Plan to the end of the

•  to determine whether to prorate the bonus to time. 

The Remuneration Committee’s normal policy is that it will

where the nature of the transaction produces exceptional 
value for shareholders and provided the performance 
targets are met the Committee will consider whether 
prorating is equitable.

Deferred Bonus Plan

The number of shares subject to subsisting deferred share 
awards on a change of control may be prorated to time.

The Committee will take into account the circumstances of 
the change of control in determining whether to apply prorating.

LTIP

VCP

The number of shares subject to subsisting deferred LTIP 
awards on a change of control will be prorated to time 
and performance.

There will be a VCP measurement date on the change 
of control and the value of additional nil-cost options 
will be calculated as at any other VCP measurement date. 
The share price used to calculate the measurement total 
shareholder return will be the offer price for the Company. 
Accrued and banked nil-cost options will become immediately 
exercisable on the date of the change of control.

The Committee has discretion:
•  to determine whether to prorate the award to time. 

The Remuneration Committee’s normal policy is that it will 
prorate for time however, in exceptional circumstances 
where the nature of the transaction produces exceptional 
value for shareholders and provided the performance 
targets are met the Committee will consider whether 
prorating is equitable; and

•  to determine to pay cash in lieu of shares.

The Committee has discretion to prorate to time the 
minimum £5,000,000 fixed value of the original grant  
(where it applies).
There is no minimum fixed value for the extension award.

Statement of conditions elsewhere in the Company 
The remuneration policy for all employees is determined in terms of best practice and ensuring that the Company is able to attract and 
retain the best people. This principle is followed in the development of our Policy. However, employee views are not specifically sought 
in determining this Policy. The Company does not currently use any remuneration comparison metrics.
Salary and benefit packages are linked to both individual and business performance. All employees participate in bonus plans which, together 
with salary reviews linked to business performance, enable all employees to share in the success of the Company. All employees which were 
employed throughout the financial year are eligible to participate in the SIP and the Company strives to offer this benefit to new parts of the 
business as soon as practical following acquisition.

Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping remuneration policy and 
practice. The Committee consulted with its principal shareholders on the VCP and the proposed changes to the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy prior to finalising the new proposals.

 50% of the annual bonus amount is deferred into nil-cost options, which vest three years from the date of grant. These options are expected to be granted in December 2017. 
The options are not subject to further performance criteria.
 The 2014 LTIP vested on 29 November 2017 after our financial year end. However given the majority of the performance period has been completed by the end of 2017, the value 
of the LTIP vesting has been included in the single figure table for 2017. See page 87 for details of the vesting for the 2014 LTIP award. Value calculated based on the average share 
price at close on 22 November 2017 of £3.511 as it was available at the time of compiling this report, rather than the average share price in last quarter of the 2017 financial year as 
it is a more accurate representation of the value provided.

4  Pension contributions represent 15% of the respective salaries. The normal retirement age for each Executive Director is 67.

The Committee considers that performance conditions for all incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business strategy, 
shareholder expectations, cyclicality of the markets in which the Company operates and external advice. To the extent that any performance

 Value calculated based on the average share price at close on 22 November 2017 of £3.511 as it was available at the time of compiling this report, rather than the average share price 
in last quarter of the 2017 financial year as it is a more accurate representation of the value provided.

No nil-cost options had vested as at 30 September 2017. 
The LTIP award granted to Stephen Morana, the Company’s former CFO, in August 2014 also vests on 29 November 2017 in accordance with 
his good leaver status outlined in the Annual Report 2016. His award of 91,955 (reduced prorata for time due to his cessation of employment 
from 170,454) will vest at 100% equating to a value of £276,000, using the share price at 22 November 2017, as above. We note that this vesting 
falls within 2018 and hence will be disclosed under payments to past Directors section next year.

Value Creation Plan (audited)
The VCP was approved by shareholders on 1 October 2015. In line with the terms of the plan the CEO accrues a number of nil-cost options 
based on the TSR achieved over an 8% threshold (below which there is no reward). The plan has a four year term and includes four measurement 
dates at which the performance is assessed which subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM will be extended to a six year term with 
two further measurement dates. 
The first measurement date occurred on 3 January 2017 when 3,233,127 nil-cost options were awarded to Alex Chesterman in respect of TSR 
performance from 1 October 2015 to 30 December 2016 as set out below. 
50% of the options will become exercisable on the third measurement date (December 2018) provided that a minimum return of 8% is 
maintained. The remaining 50% of the options will become exercisable on the fourth measurement date (December 2019) provided that 
a minimum annual return of 8% is maintained. 
The number of options granted was calculated on a measurement price of £3.197, generating an increase in total shareholder return of over 
£437 million for shareholders.

HMRC Share Incentive Plan (audited)
The Share Incentive Plan (SIP) is made available to all employees, including the Executive Directors. There are no performance conditions 
attached to the grants. 
Throughout 2017, the CEO and CFO bought Partnership Shares on a monthly basis through the plan. The Company continues to 
match Partnership Shares purchased on a one-to-one ratio. Matching Shares granted each month are subject to the Director’s continued 
employment for a period of one year from the grant date. Alex Chesterman and Andy Botha purchased 512 and 416 Partnership Shares 
respectively during the Period. The Company has issued an equal number of Matching Shares to each Executive Director.
23 June 2017 marked the three year anniversary of ZPG’s IPO and consequently the 1,137 Free Shares issued to all staff employed at IPO, 
including the CEO, became available at this date. Andy Botha was not employed at the date of IPO and therefore was not granted any 
Free Shares. At 30 September 2017, and as at the date of this report, the Free Shares awarded to Alex Chesterman remain in the SIP Trust 
and have not been withdrawn.

Payments to past Directors/payments for loss of office (audited)
There were no payments made to past Directors or for loss of office in the Period. 

Statement of Directors’ shareholdings (audited)
Shareholding requirements in operation at the Company are currently 400% of base salary for the CEO and 100% of base salary for the CFO. 
During 2017 the Remuneration Committee decided to increase the minimum shareholding requirement for the CFO to 200%. Executive Directors 
are required to build up their shareholdings over a reasonable amount of time, which would normally be five years. Andy Botha joined the 
Company on 18 April 2016 as CFO and is expected to build up the required shareholding over a reasonable period. The number of shares 
of the Company in which current Directors had a beneficial interest and details of long-term incentive interests as at 30 September 2017 
are set out in the table below.

 Includes Partnership shares purchased under the SIP. No shares were held by any connected parties. Since 30 September 2017 Alex Chesterman and Andy Botha have each 
purchased 84 Partnership Shares through the Company’s SIP. These shares have been matched on a one-to-one ratio by the Company. There have been no other movements 
since 30 September 2017 to the date of this report. 
Includes Matching Shares still subject to forfeiture awarded under the Company’s SIP and nil-cost options granted under the Annual Bonus Plan.
 The closing share price of 361.7 pence as at 30 September 2017 has been taken for the purpose of calculating the current shareholding as a percentage of salary. Unvested LTIP 
and Annual Bonus Plan shares and options do not count towards satisfaction of the shareholding guidelines. Matching Shares under the Share Incentive Plan which are still subject 
to forfeiture or lapse do not count towards the shareholding requirement.

Interests subject to performance conditions include the unvested LTIP and VCP nil-cost options.

Chief Executive Officer historical remuneration
The table below sets out the total remuneration delivered to the Chief Executive Officer over the last three years valued using the methodology 
applied to the single total figure of remuneration. The Company has expanded quickly from a start-up company and the Committee does not 
believe that the remuneration payable in its earlier years bears any comparative value to that paid in its later years and therefore the Committee 
has chosen to disclose remuneration only for the three most recent financial years:

1  The Chief Executives earnings are calculated on the same basis as the total single figure of remuneration as shown on page 84.
2 

 Average employee earnings are based on staff costs calculated on the same basis as in the notes to the financial statements, excluding social security costs, based upon the average 
number of full-time equivalent employees.

The CEO single figure doesn't include any value of any long-term incentives as the CEO participates in a multi-year VCP arrangement. 
This ratio will likely increase on vesting of the first part of the CEO's VCP in 2019. The increase in ratio from 2016 to 2017 is largely driven 
by the impact of the 2014 LTIP vesting.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee 
During the year the Committee reviewed the advisers to the Committee. Following this review the Committee retained the services of PwC 
as independent remuneration advisers.
During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive Management Team. The Committee is satisfied that advice received from PwC during the year was objective and independent.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective 
and independent advice is given to remuneration committees. Fees of £16,250 (2016: £36,250) were provided to PwC during the year in 
respect of remuneration advice received. PwC has no other connection with the Company.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Authority to purchase own shares
At last year’s AGM of the Company 
on 2 February 2017, the Company was 
authorised to purchase a maximum 
of 10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital. This authority will expire at the 
close of the 2018 AGM.

Authority to allot shares
At last year’s AGM, the Company was granted 
a general authority by its shareholders to 
allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £139,317.89 and in connection 
with a rights issue or other pre-emptive 
offer to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £278,635.79. 
During the year, the Company carried out a 
placing of 20,897,684 new Ordinary Shares, 
issued under these authorities, with an 
aggregate nominal amount of £20,897,684 
and which represented approximately 5% 
of the issued Ordinary Share capital of ZPG 
prior to the placing. These authorities will 
expire at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM 
unless revoked, varied or renewed prior to 
that meeting. Resolutions will be proposed 
at the 2018 AGM to renew these authorities.

Financial risk management
The Company’s objectives and policies 
on financial risk management, including 
information on its exposure to credit, 
price, liquidity, cash flow and other market 
risks, can be found in Note 26 to the

Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and the Company’s Articles, the Company 
has purchased and maintains Directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance cover, which 
remains in place as at the date of this report. 
A review is carried out on an annual basis 
to ensure that the Board remains satisfied 
that an appropriate level of cover is in place. 
During the year, the level of cover was 
increased by £30 million to £70 million 
to reflect the increased exposure of the 
Directors as a result of an expanded 
group following the various acquisitions 
throughout the year.
As at the date of this report, indemnities 
are in force under which the Company has 
agreed to indemnify the Directors, to the 
extent permitted by law and the Company's

the execution of their powers, duties and 
responsibilities, as Directors of the Company 
or any of its subsidiaries.

28 November 2017 the Company had 
an issued share capital of 439,014,156 
Ordinary Shares of £0.001 with 135,317 
of those Ordinary Shares held in treasury.

there are no specific restrictions on the size 
of a holding or on the transfer of the 
Ordinary Shares. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares 
that may result in the restriction of the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights 
except for the lock-up of Alex Chesterman’s 
shares that will be released after the close 
of trading on the fourth anniversary of the

Since 30 September 2017, the Company received notifications from UBS Investment Bank/
UBS Group AG that it held more than 3% of the voting rights in the Company. However, 
on 9 November 2017, the Company received a notification from UBS Investment Bank/
UBS Group AG that, as at 7 November 2017, it was no longer above the notifiable threshold.

Going concern
The consolidated financial position of the 
Company shows a positive net and current 
asset position and, as at 30 September 2017, 
the Company had a net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 2.0x. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that ZPG is well placed to manage 
its business and financial risks successfully. 
Further information on the Directors’ 
assessment can be found in the Company’s 
viability statement on page 35.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that ZPG has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
historical financial information.

Auditor and disclosure 
of information to auditor
Each of the Directors at the date of this 
report confirms that:
•  so far as he or she is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and

•  he/she has taken all the reasonable steps 

that he/she ought to have taken as a 
Director to make himself/herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of the information.

The confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to 
continue in office as auditor and a resolution 
to re-appoint it as the Company’s auditor 
will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

Subsequent events
On 1 October 2017, ZPG completed the 
acquisition of Money for £80 million 
on a cash-free, debt-free basis, plus a 
performance-based earn-out of up to 
£60 million. The acquisition was financed 
through a combination of existing cash 
resources and a £50 million extension 
to ZPG’s credit facilities.
As at the date of this report, the Company 
is well advanced in its acquisition of 
Calcasa B.V for €30 million (£26.5 million) 
on a cash-free, debt-free basis, with a 
performance-based earn-out of up to 
€50 million (£44.1 million). The acquisition is 
expected to complete on 1 December 2017 
and will be financed through a combination 
of cash resources and an extension to the 
Company’s existing credit facilities.
There have been no other reportable 
subsequent events between 30 September 
2017 and the date of signing of this report.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities

The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare such financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;

•  make judgements and accounting estimates 

that are reasonable and prudent;

•  state whether Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework has been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the 

going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.

In preparing the group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
•  properly select and apply 

accounting policies;

•  present information, including 

accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 

•  provide additional disclosures when 

compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and

•  make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;

•  the strategic report includes a fair review 

of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
•  the annual report and financial statements, 

taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

This responsibility statement was approved by 
the Board of Directors on 28 November 2017 
and is signed on its behalf by.

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion

In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 

and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;

•  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 

as adopted by the European Union;

•  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 

and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 

financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the financial statements of ZPG plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) which comprise:
•  the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
•  the consolidated and parent company statement of financial position;
•  the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
•  the consolidated and parent company cash flow statement; and
•  the related notes 1 to 29 to the group financial statements and notes 1 to 16 to the company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Summary of our audit approach

Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
•  Accounting for acquisitions;
•  Valuation of accrued income in the comparison segment;
•  Revenue recognition in the property segment; and
•  Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets.
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with >

Materiality

Scoping

The materiality that we used in the current year was £2.3 million which was determined on the basis of 4.8% 
of profit before tax. 

Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including 
group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Entities subject 
to full scope audit procedures represented 90% of the group’s revenue, 93% of the group’s profit before  
tax and 99% of the group’s net assets.

Significant changes  
in our approach

Hometrack Data Systems Limited (“HDS”) and Websky Limited (“Expert Agent”) were acquired during the year 
and full scope audit procedures were performed on these two entities. The acquisition accounting for these two 
entities has been identified as a key audit matter. There have been no other significant changes in our approach 
for the year ended 30 September 2017.

96 

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

We confirm that we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in respect of these matters.

We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going 
concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any 
such material uncertainties. However, because not all 
future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement

We have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of 
the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 to the financial 
statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the group 
contained within the strategic report on page 35.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
•  the disclosures on pages 32 to 35 that describe the principal risks and explain  

how they are being managed or mitigated;

•  the directors’ confirmation on page 35 that they have carried out a robust 

assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;

•  the directors’ statement in note 1.4 to the financial statements about whether 

they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group 
and the parent company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;

•  the directors’ explanation on page 35 as to how they have assessed the 

prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions; or

•  whether the directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects  
of the company required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) are materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

Accounting for acquisitions  >

>

Key audit matter  
description

How the scope of 
our audit responded 
to the risk

This is a new key audit matter for 2017 following the acquisitions of Hometrack (Hometrack Australia and HDS) 
and Expert Agent in the period. These acquisitions were completed in January 2017 and March 2017 respectively. 
The Purchase Price Allocation (“PPA”) in respect of acquisitions is inherently judgemental. There is a risk that if 
management use inappropriate methodologies or assumptions within the PPA exercise, that the intangible assets 
will be understated or overstated. 
We have included the key audit matter in our audit report due to the quantum of the balance, its highly 
judgemental nature, and the fact that it had a substantial impact on our overall audit strategy.
Hometrack 
Hometrack was acquired for £109.2 million in cash and debt with a further £13.0 million of deferred and 
contingent consideration expected to be paid. 
The key judgement is the calculation of contingent consideration payable to selling shareholders. Management 
conducted a multi-scenario model, utilising eight separate scenarios of equal probability, which resulted in 
£11.8 million of a potential maximum £25.0 million being recognised as consideration (and hence goodwill) as well 
as the corresponding liability. The excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired has been 
recognised as intangible assets comprised of customer relationship of £25.2 million, brands of £2.1 million, 
intellectual property of £18.5 million and goodwill of £86.3 million.
Expert Agent
Expert Agent was acquired for £20.14 million in cash and £14.74 million of deferred and deferred election 
consideration expected to be paid. 
The excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired has been recognised as intangible assets 
comprised of customer relationships of £12.7 million, software of £1.4 million, brands of £0.7 million and goodwill 
of £23.1 million. 
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 60), notes 1, 1.21 and 13 for the description of the key audit matter, group 
accounting policy, management’s consideration of critical accounting judgements and disclosure note respectively. 

Our procedures involved:
•  assessing the design and implementation of the key controls over acquisition accounting;
•  using internal experts to review the methodology and assumptions employed by management in calculating 

the fair value of the intangibles and considering the completeness of intangibles identified;

•  obtaining the underlying cash flow forecasts and discussing them with management, challenging the 

reasonableness and consistency of the underlying forecasts;

•  auditing the deferred and contingent consideration through modelling and recalculation of the inputs used; and
•  reviewing the associated disclosures to ensure that they are in accordance with IFRS 3.
In addition to the above, during the measurement period, we considered whether the group retrospectively 
adjusted the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and challenged the appropriateness of any 
change to goodwill or the income statement.

Key observations

We concurred that the acquisitions have been appropriately accounted for under IFRS 3 and that the 
assumptions and methodology used in valuing the intangibles is reasonable. 
We considered that the accounting for deferred and contingent consideration has been performed correctly  
and that management has appropriately disclosed the key sensitivities that exist.

Valuation of accrued income in comparison segment  >>

Key audit matter

How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter

Comparison segment revenue is recognised based upon the number of switches provided to suppliers, net of an 
estimated drop-out. At the period end there is an element of this revenue that has not been confirmed by the 
third party provider and judgement is required to estimate the unbilled or accrued income of £16.4 million at the 
period end. Therefore we also considered this key audit matter as a fraud risk. 
We have included the key audit matter in our audit report due to the quantum of the balance and the fact that it 
had a substantial impact on our overall audit strategy.
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 60), notes 1, 1.21 and 2 for the description of the key audit matter, 
group accounting policy, management’s consideration of key sources of estimation uncertainty and disclosure 
note respectively.

Our procedures involved:
•  assessing the design and implementation of the key controls over revenue recognition;
•  analysing revenue streams on a month by month basis to understand the drivers of fluctuations and obtain 

support for any unusual movements;

•  for a statistical sample of suppliers for which there is accrued income at year end, we sought post year-end 
confirmation of the balance from the relevant third party including invoices and cash receipts to assess the 
accuracy of the estimate of accrued income; and

•  using data analytic specialists to perform a reconciliation of the switches that occurred in the period by assessing the 

data integrity from switch creation to reported gross product numbers on which revenue is accrued.

Key observations

Based on our work we are satisfied the accounting for accrued income in the comparison segment is in line with 
accounting standards and is materially appropriate.

Revenue recognition in the property segment  >>

Key audit matter  
description

How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter

Agency revenue primarily consists of recurring subscription payments with agent and developer members 
in return for property listings. Revenue recognition is limited in complexity; however given the large volume 
of agreements there is a risk that customer subscription agreements may not be appropriately captured and 
accounted for, and hence the agency revenue population may not be complete. The number of partners has 
consistently increased over the year.
Property software services are provided to customers whereby software licenses and support are sold under the 
same contractual arrangement. The fair value accounting for these bundled contracts can be complex as the fair 
value may not be ascribed to each deliverable in accordance with IAS 18.
Therefore we also considered this key audit matter as a fraud risk. 
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 60), notes 1 and 2 for the description of the key audit matter, group 
accounting policy and disclosure note respectively. 

For Agency revenue our procedures involved:
•  assessing the design and implementation of the key controls over revenue recognition;
•  analysing revenue streams on a month by month basis using data analytics to understand the drivers of 

fluctuations including monthly partner numbers and the average revenue per partner trend, and obtained 
support for any unusual movements; 

•  selecting a sample of estate agents, ascertaining whether they are a ZPG customer or not, and if so, obtaining 

the underlying contract to ensure that the information within the CRM system is accurate and agreeing the 
agents back to the ZPG website; and 

•  corroborating information for a sample of customer contracts (or equivalent agreement) selected from the 
CRM system to subscription details, and then in turn back to the ledger to ensure that revenue has been 
appropriately recognised. 

For property software services our procedures involved:
•  assessing the design and implementation of the key controls over revenue recognition;
•  obtaining management’s assessment of revenue recognition and critically assessing the rationale applied by 

assessing whether the impact of fair valuing each element of the contract would lead to a materially different 
revenue recognition profile and testing the inputs applied;

•  for a sample of customer contracts, we evaluated the contractual terms, identifying the distinct obligations 
and establishing their respective fair values, in order to form an expectation of the revenue that should be 
recognised in the period; and

•  tracing this value to the ledger to evaluate whether revenue has been stated accurately.

Key observations

Based on our work we are satisfied the accounting for revenue recognition in the property segment 
is materially appropriate.

Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  >>

Key audit matter 
description

How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter

Key observations

There is a risk that the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may not be supported by the recoverable 
amount of the underlying business. 
The total of goodwill and acquired intangible assets balance has increased significantly to £491.0 million over the 
past three years as a result of acquisitions made. 
The assessment of the recoverable amount requires significant management judgement specifically in modelling 
the future cash flow forecasts. Therefore we also considered this key audit matter as a fraud risk. Key assumptions 
in the impairment model include a detailed cash flow forecast derived from the 2018 budget and associated two 
year projections and a long term growth rate. In addition, the group has identified five cash generating units 
(“CGU”) following the acquisitions made in the period. The CGUs are dependent on both short and long term 
growth assumptions and discount rates.
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 61), notes 1, 1.21 and 14 for the description of the key audit matter, 
group accounting policy, management’s consideration of key sources of estimation uncertainty and disclosure 
note respectively.

Our procedures entailed:
•  assessing the design and implementation of the key controls over the impairment model;
•  consideration of the Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) identification within the group;
•  checking the mechanical accuracy of the underlying impairment review model;
•  consideration of the appropriateness of the underlying forecasts, corroborating that the assumptions used 
are reasonable based upon knowledge of the business and the industry, and that the forecasts are consistent 
with those used in other aspects of the financial statements;

•  engaging internal specialists to independently calculate a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) and 

audit of any further risk premium added, to assess whether discount rates used are appropriate; 

•  comparing the assumptions used in the impairment review calculations including the discount rates and 

terminal growth rate to benchmark data and industry specific comparatives to ensure they are reasonable; and

•  reviewing the associated disclosures to ensure that they are in accordance with IAS 36.

Based on our work we are satisfied that the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets presented in the financial 
statements is appropriate and we concluded that the assumptions applied in the impairment models, taken in 
aggregate are within our acceptable range.
We concurred with management that the disclosures in note 14 are appropriate and the sensitivities disclosure 
presents the outcome of reasonably possible changes in projected revenue growth in the Property Software 
Group CGU. 

Our application of materiality

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Group materiality

£2,300,000 (2016: £2,100,000).

Basis for determining 
materiality

Materiality represents 4.8% (2016: 4.5%) of profit before tax, which is consistent with the prior period. 

Rationale for the  
benchmark applied

We consider that profit before tax is the most appropriate statutory measure for a listed business and this is also 
a key measure used by investors.

Group materiality £2.3m

Component materiality 
range £1.4m to £1.6m

Audit Committee reporting 
threshold £0.1m

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £115,000 (2016: £100,000), as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

An overview of the scope of our audit

Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the group level. 
We focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work in respect of ZPG Plc, Zoopla Limited and uSwitch Limited, which were subject 
to a full scope audit, which is consistent with the prior year. Property software services was subject to specified audit procedures where the 
extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the group’s operations at 
that location. HDS and Expert Agent were acquired in the period and were audited to statutory materiality during the group audit, which is 
lower than component materiality.
ZPG Plc, Zoopla Limited and uSwitch Limited’s operations together represent 85% of the group’s revenue (2016: 96%), 83% (2016: 97%) 
of the group’s profit before tax and 96% of the group’s net assets (2016: 98%). Our audit work for these components was executed at levels 
of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than group materiality and ranged from £1.38 million to £1.61 million 
(2016: £1.2 million to £1.5 million).
There were no component audit teams, with the entire audit including the testing of the consolidation being conducted in ZPG’s London 
head office by one central audit team.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.

Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
•  Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the 
annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or

•  Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 

appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or

•  Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 

is consistent with the financial statements; and

•  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate  

for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

•  the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 

and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report  
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.

Other matters

Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Board of Directors in 2012 to audit the financial statements 
for the year ending 30 September 2012 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments of the firm is 6 years, covering the years ending 30 September 2012 to 30 September 2017.

Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. Accounting policies
ZPG Plc is a company domiciled and incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is The Cooperage, 5 Copper Row, 
London SE1 2LH.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below for the years 
ended 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016. The policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
The consolidated statement of cash flows has been represented in the prior year to move transaction costs on acquisitions of £1.3 million 
to operating cash flows. The impact was to reduce net cash flows from operating activities by £1.3 million to £60.9 million and to reduce 
the net cash flows used in investing activities to £93.8 million.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Accounting Standards and IFRIC Interpretations (collectively IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted 
by the European Union (“adopted IFRS”). They are prepared on the historical cost basis.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires Management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. Note 1.20 and 1.21 give 
further details relating to the Group’s critical accounting estimates and judgements.
The presentational currency of the financial statements is Pound Sterling (£). Amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
are shown in round thousands unless otherwise indicated.
At the date of approval, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these consolidated financial statements 
were in issue but are only effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017:
•  Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Disclosure Initiative’ (effective 1 January 2017)* 
•  Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’ (effective 1 January 2017)* 
•  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018) 
•  IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (effective 1 January 2018)
•  Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ (effective 1 January 2018)* 
•  IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration’ (effective 1 January 2018)* 
•  Amendments to IFRS 4 ‘Insurance contracts’ (effective 1 January 2018)* 
•  Amendments to IAS 40 ‘Investment Properties’ (effective 1 January 2018)* 
•  IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019)*
•  IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (effective 1 January 2021)*
* Not yet endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments is effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 October 2018. The implementation of IFRS 9 
will require the reclassification of the Group’s Available for sale financial assets. From 1 October 2018 these assets will be measured as Fair value 
through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9. As this treatment mirrors the Group’s current policy, there is not expected 
to be any material impact on the Group’s reported results; however, Management notes that any gain or loss arising on the sale of these 
assets may no longer be able to be recognised in the Consolidated income statement but will remain within Other Comprehensive Income.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 October 2018. An initial 
impact assessment was performed during 2017 by Management to identify potential implications for the business on its existing contracts 
and the recognition of revenue. Management has identified a number of contract types which could result in a change in the profile of revenue 
recognition as currently drafted, including but not limited to: contracts for the provision of desktop software and contracts for advertising 
services. Management also notes that the current recognition of sales commission across the Group will also change and will lead to these 
costs being spread over the expected life of the contract. As the Group is still in the process of assessing the full impact of IFRS 15 it is not 
currently practicable to quantify the impact of this standard and therefore the standard could have a material impact on the future results 
of the Group, in particular revenue, adminstrative expenses and accrued and deferred revenue. Management intend to provide an indication 
of the expected impact of IFRS 15 in the interim announcement for the period to 31 March 2018.
The impact of IFRS 16 – Leases will require the Group to record its current property leases and fleet of motor vehicles on the statement of 
financial position. The leases impacted are currently treated as operating expenses. The change in recognition is expected to increase future 
depreciation charges and lead to a reduction in operating expenses. Future commitments under current operating leases are outlined in 
Note 27 which gives some indication of the impact on the Group going forward, however, as IFRS 16 is effective for the first time for the 
financial year commencing 1 October 2019 a full assessment of the standard has not yet been made and therefore the standard could have 
a material impact on the future results of the Group.
All other standards identified above are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Financial statements1. Accounting policies continued
1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the policies set out in the Group’s Annual Report for the year 
ended 30 September 2016. No new or revised accounting standards were adopted in the period.
1.3 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of ZPG Plc (“the Company”) and entities controlled by the Company 
(“its subsidiaries”) (together “the Group”). Control exists when the Group has existing rights to give it the ability to direct the relevant 
activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with the entity. The results 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date when control ceases.
Throughout the year the Group acquired a number of entities and their subsidiaries. The results of each acquisition have been consolidated 
from the date of acquisition as set out in Note 13. The consolidated results for 2017 are therefore not a like for like comparison for 2016. 
Full details of the acquisitions are set out in Note 13.
Full details of acquisitions made in 2016 are set out in the Group’s Annual Report 2016 and are summarised in Note 13.
The Company has one trading subsidiary that uses a functional currency which is different to the presentational currency of the Group. 
Hometrack Australia Limited’s functional currency is the Australian Dollar as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates.
Assets and liabilities for Hometrack Australia are translated into Pound Sterling using the exchange rate at the statement of financial position 
date and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income translated using the average exchange rate for the year. Exchange differences 
on translation into the presentational currency are recognised within other comprehensive income. The principal exchange rates for the 
Australian Dollar against Pound Sterling used in these consolidated financial statements are: average: 1.66, closing: 1.71.
1.4 Going concern
The consolidated financial position shows a positive net asset position and the Group continues to generate net cash flows from operating 
activities and maintain its current dividend policy. The Group also has access to a £325 million debt facility of which £269 million was drawn 
down at 30 September 2017. The facility includes required covenant ratios of Net Debt: EBITDA and interest cover. The Group are comfortably 
within these limits. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business and financial risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the historical financial information.
1.5 Revenue
Revenue represents amounts due for services provided during the period, net of value added tax. The Group recognises revenue under two 
categories – Property and Comparison. 
Revenue from Property derives principally from subscription to the Group’s property websites and from the provision of property software 
to UK domestic, overseas and commercial estate agents (“UK Agency revenue”), home developers (“New Homes revenue”) and overseas and 
commercial estate agents along with the provision of property data to financial and other institutions (“Other property revenue”). Subscription 
revenue, including fees for listing on the Group’s property websites or the ongoing provision of property data, is recognised over the period of 
the subscription. Software revenue includes subscription to Software as a Service (SaaS), desktop software licensing, support and installation 
fees. Installation fees are recorded at fair value when the installation is complete. Ongoing SaaS revenue, support and licensing fees are 
recognised over the service period. Revenue from other property services is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
The main sources of Comparison revenue are fees received for the comparison of gas and electricity services (“Energy revenue”) and mobile, 
broadband, pay TV and home phone services (“Communications revenue”). Revenue is recognised at the point at which a lead is generated 
to an energy or communications provider, based on the historical conversion of such leads into completed switches. Revenue from other 
comparison services (“Other Comparison revenue”) is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
1.6 Leases 
During 2016 the Group entered into a new 15 year lease agreement for its head office at The Cooperage, London. During 2017 the Group’s 
previous offices were sublet to a third party.
All of the Group’s current lease and sub-lease arrangements are recognised as operating leases as the material risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership remain with the lessor. 
Operating lease expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
lease. Rent-free periods, lease arrangement fees and other direct costs are amortised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income over the term of the lease.
Operating lease income is recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
lease and is classified as other income. Any rent-free or reduced rent periods are amortised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income over the term of the lease.

1.7 Finance income and costs
Finance income represents interest receivable on cash and deposit balances and gains recognised on foreign currency transactions. 
Interest receivable is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs represent interest charges and certain fees charged on the Group’s revolving credit facility as well as losses recognised on foreign 
currency transactions. Finance costs are recognised as they accrue using the effective interest method.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised monthly based on the translation of assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies to 
Pound Sterling and realised gains and losses on transactions recorded in the period. The Group’s principal exposure is to the Australian dollar, 
through its Australian subsidiary, and the US Dollar, through agreements with of a number of suppliers based in the United States. The Directors 
are comfortable that any sensitivity to fluctuations in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. This cost includes the purchase price, directly attributable costs and the 
estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items. The corresponding liability is recognised within 
provisions. Items of property, plant and equipment are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and are not revalued.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful economic lives, using the straight-line 
method, as follows:
Fixtures and fittings 
Computer equipment 
Leasehold improvements 
Freehold property  
The Directors review the residual values and useful economic lives of assets on an annual basis. 
1.9 Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. The consideration for 
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by 
the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, net of cash acquired. Acquisition related costs, other than those associated with the issue 
of debt or equity securities, are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value with the exception of deferred 
tax assets and liabilities, which are measured in accordance with IAS 12 – Income Taxes. Identifiable net assets include the recognition of any 
separately identifiable intangible assets. Further detail of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognised during the year on acquisitions are 
provided in Note 13.
Deferred and contingent consideration are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Where the amounts payable are classified as a 
financial liability any subsequent change in the fair value is charged/credited to the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Amounts classified as equity are not subsequently remeasured. Where consideration to Management shareholders is contingent on their continued 
employment the amount is recognised as a remuneration expense in the statement of comprehensive income over the deferral period when 
it coincides with the period of continued employment. 
1.10 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value 
of assets and liabilities acquired and is recorded as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not subsequently subject to amortisation but is tested for 
impairment annually and whenever the Directors have an indication that it may be impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination. Any impairment in carrying value is charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
1.11 Intangible assets
Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are initially recorded at cost. Intangibles arising on acquisition are recorded at fair value. All intangibles 
are subsequently stated at initial value less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as follows: 
–  5–10 years 
Brand 
–  5 years
Domain names 
–  3–10 years
Database 
Customer relationships 
–  5–10 years
Website development and computer software  –  3–8 years

www.zpg.co.uk

Financial statements1. Accounting policies continued
1.12 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount to the extent that this increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
1.13 Research and development
The Group incurs expenditure on research and development in order to develop new products and enhance the existing websites. Research 
expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs are expensed when incurred unless they meet certain criteria 
for capitalisation. Development costs whereby research findings are applied to creating a substantially enhanced website or new product are 
only capitalised once the technical feasibility and the commercial viability of the project has been demonstrated and they can be reliably 
measured. Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Once the new website enhancement or product is available for use, subsequent expenditure to maintain the website or product, or on small 
enhancements to the website or product, is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
Research and Development tax credit claims made in the UK are recognised as a credit to administrative expenses in the financial year 
relevant to the claim. Research and Development tax credits in Australia are recognised as a deduction to the tax expense.
1.14 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Full details of financial instruments are included in Note 26.
Investments in unlisted securities not meeting the definition of associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries are classified as available for 
sale financial assets and are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs. The investments are then remeasured at each subsequent 
reporting date to fair value. Changes in the fair value of the unlisted securities are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the 
exception of impairment losses. On disposal of the asset any gains and losses recorded within other comprehensive income are realised 
and are reclassified to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables are designated as loans and receivables. They are recognised at amortised cost, which is net of any allowance for 
impairment in relation to irrecoverable amounts. This is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value. The provision is reviewed 
regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historical payment profiles and past default experience. When a trade receivable is deemed 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. The Group receives interest income on certain amounts held in escrow.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are designated as other financial liabilities. They are recognised at their carrying 
amount, which is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value. 
Loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost, net of direct costs. Direct costs are released through the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income under the effective interest method, along with interest charged, over the life of the instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. The Company’s 
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity instruments and are recognised at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs. Repurchase 
of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
Financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes.
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents represent amounts held in the Group’s current accounts and overnight deposits that are immediately available.
The information set out below provides information about how the Group determines fair values of various financial assets and financial 
liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value:
•  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 

asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 

on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Details of the type of fair value input used is included within the relevant note.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued1. Accounting policies continued
1.15 Net Debt
The Group defines Net Debt as loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, both as per the statement of financial position. The Group 
does not currently hold any financial derivatives, have any leases recorded as finance leases or operate a defined benefit pension plan and 
therefore these costs are not currently considered. These, and any other financing costs, will be considered as they become applicable to the 
results of the Group. The calculation of net debt is presented in Note 21.
1.16 Current tax
Current income tax comprises UK income tax and is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date. Current tax is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it is required to be recognised directly in equity.
1.17 Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial 
position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
•  the initial recognition of goodwill;
•  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 

neither accounting or taxable profit; and

•  investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference 

and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
difference can be utilised. Deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it is 
required to be recognised directly in equity.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and 
are expected to apply when the deferred tax assets are recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
1.18 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured 
at Management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial position date and are discounted 
to present value where the impact is material. The unwinding of any discount is recognised in finance costs.
Dilapidation provisions are recognised based on Management’s best estimate of costs to make good the Group’s leasehold properties at the 
end of the lease term.
Onerous lease provisions relate to contracts whereby the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits expected 
to be received under it. 
Restructuring provisions are recognised when a full restructuring plan has been developed and communicated. The restructuring provisions 
represent expected costs incurred of completing the restructure including redundancy costs.
1.19 Employee benefits: defined contribution benefit scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme which is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed 
contributions into a fund. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient 
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions payable to the fund are 
charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period to which they relate.

1.20 Share-based payments
The Group provides equity-settled share-based incentive plans whereby ZPG Plc grants shares or nil-cost options over its shares to employees 
of its subsidiaries for their employment services. The Group also issues warrants over shares in ZPG Plc to a number of the Group’s estate agent 
partners, allowing them to acquire shares in exchange for making their property listings available for inclusion on the Group’s property websites.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and partners are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. 
The fair value is measured using a suitable valuation model, including the Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo valuation models where appropriate, 
and is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken 
into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement of financial position date so that, ultimately, 
the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions 
are factored into the fair value of the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition. 
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are set out in Note 24.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in fair value of the options, measured immediately 
before and after the modification, is charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Within the company accounts of ZPG Plc equity-settled share options granted directly to employees or estate agent partners of a subsidiary 
are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary. The capital contribution is measured by reference to the fair value of the share-based 
payments charge for the period and is recognised as an increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding credit to equity.
A number of shares are held in trust in order to settle future exercises of the Group’s share incentive schemes. Details of the trusts are 
included in Note 24. Shares held in trust are treated as a deduction from equity.
Employer’s National Insurance Contributions are accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%. The amount accrued is based on the market 
value of the shares at 30 September 2017 after deducting the exercise price of the share option. 
1.21 Sources of estimation uncertainty
Comparison revenue and accrued income
Revenue generated by the Comparison division is recognised at the point at which a transaction or interaction on the Group’s website 
is completed and a lead is generated. A Management estimate is required in calculating a revenue accrual to estimate the number of 
successful switches based upon leads provided for each partner in the period between the last date of billing and the latest partner data 
being made available. The accrued income is estimated by considering the volume of leads that have passed from the Group’s website to 
the partner, the historical conversion of such leads into completed switches and contracted revenue per switch.
Recognition of acquired intangibles on acquisition
During the period the Group completed its acquisition of Hometrack, ExpertAgent, TechnicWeb and Ravensworth. The process of determining 
the fair value of intangible assets acquired in each acquisition requires an estimation of future cash flows arising from acquired intangibles 
and there is a risk that inaccurate estimation could lead to the valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill being misstated. The details 
of assets and liabilities recognised upon acquisition is set out in note 13.
The Group engaged third party valuation experts for Hometrack and ExpertAgent to mitigate the risk associated with the valuation of assets 
and liabilities upon acquisition; however, estimation uncertainty still exists in the preparation of forecasts that underpin the valuation models. 
Intangibles recognised are subsequently amortised over their useful economic lives; as such, no future revaluation of the assets recognised 
will be made except for the purposes of impairment reviews.
Recognition of earn-out agreements
In consideration for the acquisition of Hometrack an earn-out agreement was entered which is contingent upon the future performance of 
a ten-year licence agreement also entered into at the point of acquisition. The earn-out is measured at fair value at the point of acquisition 
using discounted future cashflows under a range of weighted scenarios requiring an estimation of the future performance of the currently 
nascent licence agreement. 
Deferred and contingent consideration on the acquisition of Hometrack was recognised at £13 million. At each reporting period the earn-out 
will be measured at fair value with any revaluation being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The initial fair value recognised 
upon acquisition was assessed to represent fair value as at 30 September 2017.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
The Group holds goodwill and intangibles on the statement of financial position in respect of business acquisitions made. Acquired intangibles 
include acquired goodwill, brands, customer relationships, databases, websites and software of which £491.0 million has been recognised 
as at 30 September 2017 (2016: £322.6 million). The Group is required to review these assets annually for impairment. Determining whether 
goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable value of the relevant cash-generating unit, which represents 
the higher of fair value and value in use. The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit, discounted using a suitable discount rate to determine if any impairment has occurred. 
The impairment review has concluded that the carrying value of the Group’s intangible assets is supported by the value in use of the 
respective cash-generating units. Details of the impairment analysis are included in Note 14.

1.22 Key accounting judgements
PropertyFinder Group barter transaction 
PropertyFinder Group is a Dubai-based business with leading property portals across the Middle East and North Africa. During the period the 
propertyfinder.com domain name was transferred in exchange for 1% of the issued share capital of PropertyFinder International Limited, the 
PropertyFinder Group parent entity. 
A key accounting judgement was made in recognising the fair value of the acquired asset as required by IAS 38. Property Finder International 
Limited is a private company registered in the British Virgin Islands and as such is required to make only limited public financial disclosure. 
Determining the fair value of the investment is therefore subject to inherent uncertainty. Management used various sources of publicly 
available information, including the audited value of an investment in PropertyFinder Group disclosed by a listed investment company to 
determine the fair value at acquisition. 
The investment in PropertyFinder is held as an available for sale financial asset and therefore is subsequently measured at fair value at each 
reporting date. As at 30 September 2017 the asset is valued at £1.7 million on the statement of financial position.
1.23 Alternative performance measures
In the analysis of the Group’s financial performance certain information disclosed in the consolidated financial statements may be prepared 
on a non-GAAP basis or has been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP 
measure. These measures are reported in line with how financial information is analysed by Management. When reviewing performance, the 
Directors use a combination of both statutory and adjusted performance measures. The adjusted performance measures, including Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted basic EPS, provide additional information to help assess the underlying performance of the business as they strip out 
deal related costs and give a closer approximation to ZPG’s cash flows. The non-GAAP measures are designed to increase comparability 
of the Group’s financial performance year on year. However, these measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP measures adopted 
by other companies. The key non-GAAP measures presented by the Group are:
•  Adjusted EBITDA – which is defined as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and 

exceptional items (Note 3); and

•  Adjusted basic EPS – which is defined as profit for the year, excluding exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising 
on acquisitions, adjusted for tax (adjusted profit for the year) and divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue for the 
year (Note 11).

Both of these measures are used in determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Management and are used by the 
Company’s external debt providers to assess performance against covenants and determine the interest charge.

2. Business segments
The Board of Directors has been identified as the Group’s chief operating decision maker. The monthly reporting pack provided to the 
Board to enable assessment of the performance of the business has been used as the basis for determining the Group’s operating segments.
Whilst the chief operating decision maker monitors the performance of the business at a revenue and Adjusted EBITDA level, depreciation 
and amortisation, share-based payments, exceptional items, finance income and costs and income tax are all monitored on a consolidated basis. 
Assets and liabilities are also managed on a centralised basis and are not reported to the chief operating decision maker in a disaggregated format. 
The chief operating decision maker monitors six individual revenue streams as set out below. The six revenue streams are grouped under two 
headings: Property and Comparison. Adjusted EBITDA is monitored on an aggregated basis under these two headings. Revenue and costs 
shown under the Agency heading include trading for 10 months of TechnicWeb, seven months of ExpertAgent and one month of Ravensworth, 
being the results of each entity from the date of acquisition. Other property revenue includes eight months trading of Hometrack. The consolidated 
results for 2017 are therefore not a like for like comparative for 2016.
Property
•  Agency revenue, which represents property advertising services and the provision of property software, websites and other marketing 

materials to estate agents and lettings agents;

•  New Homes revenue, which represents property advertising services provided to new home developers; and
•  Other property revenue, which predominantly represents the provision of property data to large financial institutions and other third 

parties as well as display advertising and other data services.

Comparison
•  Energy revenue, which represents gas and electricity switching services;
•  Communications revenue, which represents mobile, broadband, pay TV and home phone switching services; and
•  Other Comparison revenue, which predominantly represents financial services switching, boiler cover, business energy and data 

insight services. 

All material revenues in 2017 are generated in the UK and Australia (UK: £240.1 million, Australia: £4.4 million). In 2016 all material revenues 
were generated in the UK.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued3. Adjusted EBITDA
The performance measure Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to help assess the underlying performance of the business 
as it strips out deal related costs and gives a closer approximation to ZPG’s cash flows. Adjusted EBITDA is used by Management to run the 
business, in determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Management and is used by the Company’s external debt provider 
to assess performance against covenants and to determine the interest charge.
The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional 
items. Exceptional items include costs and income which Management believes to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence. 
Such items would include costs associated with business combinations, one-off gains and losses on disposal, and similar items of a non-recurring 
nature together with reorganisation costs and similar charges. In 2017 the majority of exceptional items relate to the acquisition of subsidiaries 
set out in Note 13.
This is adjusted for share-based payment expenses which are comprised of charges relating to: (i) warrants issued to certain of the Group’s 
partners; and (ii) employee incentive plans which are aimed at retaining staff and aligning employee objectives with those of the Group. 
The Directors consider that excluding share-based payments and other non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortisation in arriving 
at Adjusted EBITDA gives an alternative measure of the consolidated underlying financial performance and a closer approximation to the 
consolidated operating cash flows. 
The table below presents a reconciliation of profit for the period to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods shown:

Operating profit

Corporation tax is calculated at 19.5% (2016: 20%) of the taxable profit for the year.
On 15 September 2016 the Finance act 2016 confirmed a reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 
1 April 2020. The Finance Bill was substantively enacted at the prior year end date and therefore the one-off impact of remeasuring the 
UK deferred tax assets and liabilities for the rate change was recognised at 30 September 2016.

The Group’s effective tax rate for the year ended 30 September 2017 is 22.2% (2016: 20.5%). The effective tax is higher than the statutory 
rate due to non-deductible transaction costs and management deferred and contingent consideration incurred on acquisitions. In 2016 the 
impact of non-deductible expenses was offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction in the 
corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020.

Adjusted Earnings per share figures exclude exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions which arise 
only on consolidation. Management believes that excluding the amortisation of these intangibles better reflects the underlying performance 
of the Group and increases comparability of performance year on year.
The dilutive effect of share options and warrants arises from the various share schemes operated by the Company as set out in Note 24. 
The 2.4 million potentially issuable shares relate to the Company’s option to settle up to 50% of the deferred payment for the acquisition 
of ExpertAgent in shares.

insights and analytics and has a strong position in the Australian market. The brand is considered to be highly recognisable in both these markets. 
The brand has been valued using a relief from royalty approach. A brand royalty rate of 1.4% and a post-tax discount rate 12.85% of have 
been used to determine the net present value of cash flows. The useful economic life of the brand has been assessed at 10 years in line with

and local authorities. At the time of acquisition customers include 15 of the top 20 mortgage lenders in UK as well as all four leading 
Australian mortgage lenders. Over 70% of Hometrack’s revenues are subscription based and underpinned by long-term relationships. 
The customer relationships have been valued using a multi-period excess earnings approach. A post-tax discount rate of 13.0% has been applied

13a.2 Goodwill
Software
£18.5 million has been recognised in respect of Hometrack’s software intellectual property. Hometrack’s Automated Valuation Model (“AVM”) 
technology underpins the market insights, analytics valuations and data services it provides to its customers. The technology is recognised by 
all the major ratings agencies in the UK.
The IP has been valued using a relief from royalty approach. A royalty rate of 13% and a post-tax discount rate 12.85% of have been used to 
determine the net present value of cash flows. The useful economic life of the IP has been assessed at eight years.
In addition to the skilled workforce acquired, goodwill of £86.3 million represents the significant value of combining Hometrack’s property 
data and expertise with the existing property database of the Group and the benefit of incorporating Hometracks’s products and data into 
the Group’s existing product offering for UK estate agents. Management believes there are significant benefits for both its consumers and 
partners of incorporating Hometrack into the Group to further improve the quality and depth of insight and analysis that it can provide into 
the UK property market, which in turn provides additional value for the Group.
13a.3 Debt assumed and discharged

by ZPG Plc on acquisition. 
13a.4 Deferred and contingent consideration
On acquisition the Group recognised deferred and contingent consideration of £13.0 million of which £11.8 million represents the fair value 
of a commercial earn-out agreement with the sellers. The settlement of the commercial earn-out will be in the range of £nil to £25.0 million 
payable up to 10 years’ post-acquisition. The recognised fair value was determined using unobservable inputs (Level 3) within a weighted 
average scenario analysis. The inputs included a range of potential revenues generated by the underlying contract, which are unobservable, 
discounted at a discount rate of 13%. At each reporting period the earn-out liability will be considered in light of any additional information 
available with any adjustment being recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The fair value is equal to the 
carrying value.
A further £10.2 million is payable to Management shareholders and is not contingent on performance but is conditional on the continued 
employment of Management up to and including the date of payment. In accordance with IFRS 3, this consideration will be recognised as 
a remuneration expense in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the deferral period of between 12 months 
and 24 months from the date of acquisition. The Group is accruing the full £10.2 million over the deferral period, adjusted by an estimation 
of the number of leavers.

the Group’s Comparison division and the potential integration of products such as Moveit, which allow consumers to select from a large list

the issued share capital of TechnicWeb Limited for total consideration of £2.2 million as measured in accordance with IFRS 3. The primary 
reason for the acquisition is to increase the Group’s current product offering for UK estate agents.
TechnicWeb was consolidated into the Group as of 30 November 2016. In the period, TechnicWeb contributed revenue of £0.8 million and 
adjusted EBITDA of £(0.3) million to the consolidated results of the Group.
The purchase has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. In calculating the 
goodwill arising on acquisition the fair value of net assets acquired was assessed and no material adjustments from book value were made to 
existing assets and liabilities. The Group has also recognised a number of separately identifiable intangibles as part of the acquisition, details 
of which are set out in the table below.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are as follows:

Property, plant and equipment
Trade and other receivables
Corporation tax asset
Trade and other payables

Total net liabilities acquired

Intangible assets recognised on acquisition:
– Software

Software
TechnicWeb specialises in designing custom-built, fully responsive websites for the property sector. TechnicWeb owns and develops software 
to streamline the process of producing a bespoke fully responsive website for its estate agent partners.
13d.2 Goodwill
As with Ravensworth, goodwill represents the inherent value in the workforce acquired and the revenue synergies available from the cross-sell 
of TechnicWeb’s products to the Group’s existing customer base and from the integration of TechnicWeb’s products into ZPG’s combined offering.
13d.3 Deferred and contingent consideration
On acquisition the Group recognised £0.6 million of deferred consideration which represents the fair value of a commercial earn-out 
agreement with the sellers.

Goodwill and intangibles are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) with its recoverable 
amount, which represents the higher of its estimated fair value and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of 
the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The intangible assets relate to five separate CGUs: Comparison – uSwitch, Property marketing (which includes Zoopla, TechnicWeb and Ravensworth), 
Hometrack, Property Software Group and ExpertAgent. Intangible assets include £5.2 million (2016 : £1.3 million) of internally generated assets. 
Goodwill and intangibles are allocated to each CGU per the table below.

Financial statements14. Intangible assets continued
The recoverable amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are based on their value in use, which is determined using cash flow projections 
derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a three year period. They reflect Management’s expectations of revenue, 
EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business 
performance. Cash flows for ExpertAgent and Hometrack after the three year period are based on forecasts used for the recent fair value 
exercise at acquisition, tending down towards the perpetuity growth rate. Cash flows for other CGUs, beyond the three year period have 
been extrapolated using a perpetuity growth rate.
A growth rate of 2% has been applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity. Growth has been capped at 2% across all CGUs so as 
not to exceed the long-term expected growth rate of the industry and country the Group operates in, in accordance with IAS 36. The pre-tax 
discount rate used for each CGU was in the range of 13.2% to 15.5%.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of each CGU’s assets exceeds their carrying value, as such no impairment was 
identified. Amending the analysis such that a growth rate into perpetuity of negative 1%, or a reasonable increase in discount rate, is applied 
across all CGUs whilst holding all other variables constant would not give rise to an impairment.
The Directors note that the three year forecast for the Property Software Group CGU includes revenue and margin growth resulting from 
new and recently launched products. Failure to achieve the forecasted cash flows could indicate an impairment. Headroom currently stands 
at £20.0 million for this CGU. 2020 cash flows would need to fall by 26% from current forecasts to eliminate this headroom. 
Indicators of impairment for all CGUs, including Property Software Group, will continue to be assessed throughout the 2018 financial year.

Financial statements19. Deferred and contingent consideration
The Group recognised a total of £29.4 million in respect of deferred payments due on acquisitions made in the period, as set out below and 
detailed in Note 13.
A further £11.3 million was recognised through the income statement in relation to payments to continuing Management shareholders. £2.8 million 
was recognised in respect of uSwitch, £5.3 million of Hometrack, £3.0 million for Property Software Group and £0.2 million for TechnicWeb.
During the year the Group also settled £33.0 million due in respect of uSwitch, Property Software Group and Hometrack. Amounts paid and 
due to be paid to Management shareholders of uSwitch are held in escrow. Of the £32.7 million recorded on the statement of cash flows, 
£9.7 million of deferred and contingent consideration settled during the year was conditional on the continued employment of Management 
(2016: £2.9 million).
There have been no changes to the expected outcome of ongoing contingent consideration requirements made during the period outside 
of the finalisation of the acquisition accounting for entities acquired in the year as set out in Note 13. The fair value of deferred and contingent 
consideration is therefore considered equal to its carrying value. The Group’s liabilities in respect of deferred and contingent consideration 
arising on acquisitions are set out below:

At 1 October 2016
Recognised on acquisition of TechnicWeb

The dilapidation provisions relate to Management’s best estimate of costs to make good the Group’s leasehold properties at the end of the 
lease term. The release in the period represents the completion of a sub-lease on the Company’s previous head office location which 
transferred the Company’s exit obligations. £0.1 million of the provision was utilised prior to the sub-lease.
The utilisation and release of onerous lease provisions in the period relates to the successful sub-lease of the Company’s previous head office 
as mentioned above, which had previously been provided for. The onerous lease provision recognised during the year and held at 30 September 2017 
relates to Management’s best estimate of the fair value of future lease payments falling due prior to the expiry of a legacy lease agreement 
on computer servers relating to one to the Group’s acquired entities. This onerous lease provision will be fully utilised in the 2018 financial year.
Restructuring provisions are recognised in respect of redundancy and other costs in relation to internal restructuring. 

21. Loans and borrowings
On 30 April 2015 the Group entered into an agreement for the provision of a five year, £150 million revolving credit facility. On 18 April 2016 
a £50 million extension to the revolving credit facility was agreed to finance the acquisition of Property Software Group, this was increased 
by a term loan of £75 million in January 2017 to finance the acquisition of Hometrack and ExpertAgent and a further term loan of £50 million 
in September 2017 to fund the acquisition of Money. The Group’s total facility at 30 September 2017 is therefore £325 million. The drawn 
portion of the facility incurs interest at UK Libor plus a margin. The margin is variable based on the Group’s net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
ratio. The effective interest rate for the period is set out in Note 26.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. Deferred tax assets have been recognised 
in respect of all temporary differences giving rise to income tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recoverable.

On 31 January 2017 the Company placed a total of 20,897,684 new ordinary shares in the Company raising gross total proceeds of £76.3 million. 
The new shares are credited as fully paid and rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each in the capital 
of the Company, including in respect of the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.
Other reserves – Merger reserve
The merger reserve was created in May 2012 from the premium on shares issued for the acquisition of The Digital Property Group Limited. 
In 2014 the merger reserve increased as a result of the Group’s reorganisation prior to the initial public offering. The intangible assets are 
now fully amortised.

ii) Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Company operates an equity-settled Long Term Incentive Plan that grants nil-cost options to eligible employees which vest at the end 
of a three year vesting period. The vesting of the options is subject to both Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) performance criteria. The Group recognised a charge of £1.8 million (2016: £0.9 million) in respect of this scheme.
A total of 1,291,686 options have been granted in respect of the 2017 financial year. None of the options granted are exercisable as at 
30 September 2017. The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of the LTIP options granted on 6 December 2016. 
There were no other material grants in 2017. The total outstanding number of LTIP options granted to date is 3,210,159 (2016: 2,866,354).

The volatility assumption, measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns, has been calculated using historical daily data 
of six comparator companies over a term commensurate with the expected life of each option. Dividend equivalent payments will be made in 
respect of vested options in the form of additional shares.
Following the announcement of these results the LTIP award which was granted in August 2014 will vest subject to fulfilment of the 
performance criteria. 
iii) Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The SIP is an all-employee share ownership plan which has been designed to meet the requirements of Schedule 2 of the Income Tax (Earnings 
and Pensions) Act 2003 so that shares can be provided to UK employees under the SIP in a tax-efficient manner. Under the scheme employees 
may be awarded Free Shares and/or offered the opportunity to purchase Partnership Shares with one Free Matching Share for each Partnership 
Share purchased. During the period the Company granted a total of 90,841 (2016: 92,581) Matching Shares all of which are still subject to 
forfeiture should the employee leave within 12 months of the grant date. The Group recognised a charge of £0.3 million (2016: £0.3 million) 
in respect of shares under this scheme.
iv) Deferred Bonus Plan
The Company operates a Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) which defers a proportion of eligible employees’ annual bonuses into nil-cost options. The 
options vest over a period of between one and three years from the end of the performance period. The performance period for the 2017 DBP 
runs from 1 October 2016 until 30 September 2017. The Group recognised a charge of £0.7 million (2016: £0.4 million) in respect of this scheme.

v) Value Creation Plan
On 1 October 2015 the Company launched the VCP. The VCP grants nil-cost options to the Company’s CEO based on Total Shareholder Return 
over a three and four year period. The fair value of the scheme is £4.3 million spread over the four year period. A charge of £1.2 million 
(2016: £1.2 million) was recognised in the 2017 financial year.
On 3 January 2017 3,233,127 nil-cost options were granted under the Value Creation Plan. The nil-cost options are subject to the rules of the 
Value Creation Plan and will vest depending on performance against Total Shareholder Return targets. 
vi) Management deal related performance bonus
On 1 May 2016 an amendment was made to the uSwitch deal related management performance bonus such that the employee can elect to receive 
the bonus in the form of shares in ZPG Plc instead of a fixed cash element. The Group recognised a charge of £0.6 million (2016: 0.4 million) 
in respect of this scheme. As at 30 September 2017 2,533,646 options remain outstanding with settlement expected, in either cash or ZPG 
shares, on 1 June 2018.
vii) Big Goals
On 28 February 2017 an amendment was made to the Group’s Big Goal Incentive Plan. The scheme grants nil-cost options to all employees 
on achievement of Group-wide targets. The scheme was previously settled in cash. The Group has recognised a charge of £0.4 million 
(2016: £nil) in respect of this scheme in the 2017 financial year.
viii) Warrants
Zoopla Limited has entered into agreements with a number of estate agent partners whereby the partners agree to pay annual fees for advertising 
on ZPG’s property websites over a five year period in exchange for a fixed number of warrants over Ordinary Shares. The warrants are issued 
annually over the five year term of the agreements at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of each share (£0.001). Some or all of the 
warrants are forfeited if service agreements are terminated before the end of the term.
The Group holds shares in treasury to settle future warrant exercises. At 30 September 2017 135,317 shares were held in treasury (2016: 162,789).
The total charge recognised for the year ended 30 September 2017 in respect of warrants was £0.5 million (2016: £0.4 million).

26. Financial instruments
Carrying amount and fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The Group has shareholdings and commercial arrangements with a number of other entities. Where these holdings do not give the Group 
significant influence over the entity the holdings are classified as Available for sale financial assets. Details for available for sale financial 
assets are included in Note 16. The valuation of all available for sale financial assets are based on level 2 inputs. The Group uses publicly 
available financial information to determine the fair value of its shareholding and any warrants held. The fair value of these assets is equal 
to their carrying value.
All other financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, are designated as “Loans and receivables” and are held at amortised cost. All 
financial liabilities are classified as “Other liabilities” and are measured at amortised cost. The Directors consider that the carrying amounts 
of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the consolidated financial statements are approximate to their fair values. 
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments:
•  credit risk;
•  market risk; and
•  liquidity risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or bank (“counterparty”) fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting 
in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of each period was equal to the carrying amount of 
financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics 
of each counterparty. 
The potential for customer default varies between the Group’s two divisions. The customer base of the Property division is large, so there is 
no significant concentration of credit risk. The Comparison division operates in a market with a small number of customers, which creates a 
concentration of debtor balances, and from time to time the amounts due from one or a number of suppliers may be material. However, 
customers within this market are often large energy and telecommunications organisations with high credit ratings and access to significant 
funds. The Group’s largest customer contributed to 10% (2016: 18%) of the Group’s trade receivables balance. 
The Group manages counterparty risk on its trade receivables through strict credit control quality measures and regular aged debt monitoring 
procedures. The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although it does not hold collateral over any trade 
receivable balances. Overdue amounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary. This provision is 
reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of ageing profile, historical payment profiles and past default experience. The Group 
has long-standing relationships with its key customers and extremely low historical levels of customer credit defaults.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was granted up to the period end date.
Receivables written off during the year to 30 September 2017 was £415,000 (2016: £470,000). As at 30 September 2017 receivables of 
£1,447,000 were past due but not impaired (2016: £1,386,000).
The credit risk associated with bank and deposit balances is mitigated by the use of banks with good credit ratings.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the income and financial management of the Group. The 
Group is not exposed to any significant currency risk and there is a minimal interest rate risk on cash and bank balances. However, the Group 
has borrowings subject to an interest rate calculated with reference to Libor. Changes in interest rates therefore impact the financial results 
of the Group. The Directors actively monitor interest rate risk and note that interest rates remain at a historical low. The Directors believe 
that any reasonable increase in the Libor rate would not significantly impact the Group. Therefore, the Group does not hedge its interest rate 
risk at this time. At 30 September 2017 borrowings of £269 million were subject to floating interest rates (2016: £151.5 million). 
At 30 September 2017 if Libor were to have increased by 1% throughout the year with all other variables held constant profit before tax 
would decrease by £2.0 million (2016: £1.2 million) as a result of additional interest incurred. Therefore, the Directors are comfortable that any 
sensitivity to fluctuations in interest or exchange rates would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refers to the ability of the Group to meet the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash as they 
fall due. Management regularly reviews performance against budgets and forecasts to ensure sufficient cash funds are available to meet 
its contractual obligations.
The Group’s activities are highly cash generative allowing it to effectively service working capital requirements. At 30 September 2017 
the Group held total cash and cash equivalents of £75.4 million (2016: £3.4 million) and net debt of £191.5 million (2016: £146.3 million).
The Group has access to a £200.0 million revolving credit facility (RCF), of which £144 million was drawn down at 30 September 2017. 
The remaining £56 million undrawn facility allows the Group to secure additional external financing should it be required. The total facility 
requires the Group to meet certain covenants based on the Group’s interest cover and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio. Exceeding the 
covenants would result in the Group being in breach of the facility, which may lead to the facility being withdrawn. Management regularly 
monitors and models covenant compliance and prepares detailed forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available. The Directors 
are satisfied that there is reasonable headroom on each of the Group’s debt covenant ratios.
In addition to the £200 million RCF the Company increased its total facility in the period by £125 million with the draw down of two term 
loans of £75 million and £50 million to fund the acquisitions of Hometrack and Money respectively. The £75 million is subject to two bullet 
payments of £10 million in March 2018 and March 2019 with the remaining balance falling due on April 2020 at the end of the term facility.

Interest on the revolving credit facility assumes that the Group makes no further capital repayments until maturity in 2020.

1 
2   Term repayments of £10 million are due in 2018 and 2019 with no further repayments due until maturity of the term facility in 2020. 

Treasury and capital risk management
The Group’s policy is to actively manage its cash and capital structure to ensure that it complies with its current debt covenant ratios, 
maintains its current dividend policy and minimises the Group’s interest payments by paying down its debt where possible. The Group 
is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Management will consider the use of excess cash, including the payment of special dividends to shareholders and M&A activity, based 
on the risks and opportunities of the Group at that time. 
The Directors can manage the Group’s capital structure through the issue or redemption of either debt or equity instruments and by adjustment 
of the Group’s dividend paid to equity holders. The Directors believe that the current debt to equity ratio remains appropriate but continue 
to monitor the efficiency of the capital structure on an ongoing basis. 

27. Operating lease commitments
At the statement of financial position date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under 
non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows:

Within one year
In the second to fifth year inclusive
After five years

All operating lease commitments are in respect of property leases held by the Group.

ZPG Plc  Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Company financial statements

1. Accounting policies and basis of accounting
The Directors have applied International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
The accounting policies and the financial risk management policies, where relevant to the Company, are consistent with those of the 
consolidated Group as set out in Notes 1 to 29 of the consolidated financial statements. 
The statement of cash flows has been represented in the prior year to move transaction costs on acquisitions of £1.3 million to operating 
cash flows. The impact was to reduce net cash flows from operating activities and the net cash flows used in investing activities by £1.3 million.
Statement of comprehensive income
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented 
a statement of comprehensive income. The profit for the period ended 30 September 2017 was £28.2 million (2016: £34.1 million).

2. Auditor’s remuneration
The Company incurred a cost of £140,000 (2016: £65,000) for statutory audit services for the period ended 30 September 2017. 
The Company incurred a cost of £40,000 (2016: £28,000) in relation to non-audit fees provided by the statutory auditor.

3. Employee costs and Directors’ remuneration
The Company has no employees other than the Directors of the Company. Remuneration paid to the Directors was accounted for and 
paid by the Company’s subsidiary, Zoopla Limited. Details of Directors’ remuneration are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 66 to 91. 

4. Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost less any provision for impairment. The investment in subsidiaries balance of £421.1 million represents 
the Company’s 100% shareholding in Zoopla Limited, uSwitch Limited, Property Software Holdings Limited and Hometrack.co.uk Limited 
as set out in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Property Software Holdings Limited was acquired on 28 April 2016 as detailed 
in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 
During the year ZPG Plc successfully completed a restructuring of the uSwitch entities within the Group. All uSwitch trade and assets were 
transferred into the entity uSwitch Limited at nil gain or loss. The entire share capital of uSwitch Limited was then sold by uSwitch Digital 
Limited to ZPG Plc at the carrying value of assets and liabilities acquired. Subsequent to the transaction, Ulysses Enterprises Limited and its 
subsidiaries are dormant with strike off applications in progress. Intercompany loans including these due to the Company from subsidiaries 
were settled prior to the restructuring or were capitalised through the issuance of ordinary share capital. The restructuring led to a net 
increase in the investment of £9.4 million due to the capitalisation of existing intercompany loans.
During the year the Company recognised an increase in the investment in Zoopla Limited, uSwitch Limited and Hometrack.co.uk Limited in 
respect of the Group’s employee share schemes. Consistent with the Group accounting policies outlined in Note 1.20 to the consolidated 
financial statements, equity-settled share options granted directly to a subsidiary’s employees are treated as a capital contribution to the 
subsidiary. The capital contribution is measured by reference to the consolidated share-based payments charge and is recognised as an 
increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding credit to retained earnings.

As such, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown 
risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual 
results, performance or developments to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 
These factors include, but are not limited to: 
•  a change in the competition within the industry in which 

we operate; 

•  a change, due to various factors which may include the 
macroeconomic conditions in which we operate, in the 
level of transactions in the UK residential property market; 

•  a change in technological developments;
•  the loss of any of our important commercial relationships; and
•  any increase in litigation or disputes.
We caution that the foregoing list of factors may not contain all of 
the material factors that are important to you and you should not 
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which 
speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We undertake no 
obligation, and are not under any obligation, to update or keep
