Gender Pay GaP rePort 2017
Vines Ltd 

introdUCtion

Vines Ltd is required by law to annually publish our annual gender 
pay gap under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
Regulations 2017. 

It should not be confused with Equal Pay which relates to males and 
females being paid equally for the same or similar work.

We support the UK Government’s drive for companies to be more 
transparent on gender pay issues and confirm that the data reported 
is accurate and in line with The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017.

oUr BUsiness and PeoPLe

The Automotive industry is a historically male dominated 
environment, at Vines Ltd we employ circa 350 people across three 
centres in the South East aged from 16 – 77.  Of the circa 350 staff 
72% of the workforce are male vs 28% who are women.

We are committed to the principle of equal opportunities and 
equal treatment for all employees regardless of sex, race, religion 
or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, 
sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability. We have a 
clear policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent 
work, regardless of their sex (or any other characteristics set out 
above) As such, it;

•	 Carries out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals;
•	 Evaluates job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair 

structure

We are therefore confident that our gender pay gap does not stem 
from paying men and women differently for doing the same or 
equivalent work.

CLosinG tHe GaP

Vines Ltd gender pay gap is the result of the roles in which men and 
women work within the organisation and the salaries and bonuses 
that these roles attract. Our business has more males within the 
management, sales and technician teams and as such our average 
male salaries and bonuses (mean and median) are higher than our 
average females’ salaries and bonuses. 

•	 Vines Ltd are committed to helping all employees achieve their 

potential throughout their career

•	 We have processes in place to strive for equality through our 

recruitment and retention practices

•	 We are confident that all of our processes for pay and reward 
are fair, but we recognise that there is room for improvement, 
particularly with the imbalance of males to females in 
management, sales and technician roles.
