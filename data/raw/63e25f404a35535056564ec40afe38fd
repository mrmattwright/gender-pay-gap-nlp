We are  required to report our Gender Pay Gap, the difference in average earnings for male and female employees, for the period which includes 5 April 2017 and annually thereafter. The analysis also includes bonuses and similar awards paid in the preceding 12 months. In this analysis 64% were female and 36% were male.  Like many organisations, our initial gender pay report shows a mixed picture; there are aspects to be rightly proud of and preserve, and areas for attention.  We are very pleased that at Metropolitan, almost half of 334 colleagues in the top quartile pay bracket are women (49.4%).  Additionally, of the 333 colleagues in the median to upper quartile of pay, over 60% are women.  It’s also the case that our pay data does not show any material difference in pay between men and women doing the same job.  Our median gender pay gap between men and women is 14.8%, read the full report to find out more detail.
