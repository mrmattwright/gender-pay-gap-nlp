GENDER PAY REPORT 

 

The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the gross hourly earnings 
of  all  male  and  female  employees  â€“  part-time,  full-time  and  at  all  levels.  This  is 
different  from  equal  pay,  which  looks  at  the  earnings  of  men  and  women 
performing the same (or similar) work within an organisation. 
 
We are confident that our approach to pay supports equal pay for equal work. For 
all employees undertaking similar roles (regardless of gender) our approach to pay is 
to  ensure  there  is  fairness;  we  also  take  into  account  factors  such  as  market 
reference  points,  experience/skills,  location  and  performance  in  setting  individual 
pay.  
 
We  regularly  review  our  pay  levels  and  practices  as  part  of  an  annual  pay  review 
and benchmarking exercise and in response to the requirement of the gender pay 
gap  legislation  we  have  reviewed  all  roles,  at  all  levels,  across  our  business  to 
understand the full picture of our results. 
 
Our  analysis  (see  table  below)  indicates  a  mean  gender  pay  gap  is  15%,  however 
our median pay gap is just 2%.

Our mean bonus / commission gap bonus / commission gap is 33% and the median 
bonus/commission gap is 28%. This relates to the higher incidence of male to female 
employees  at  senior  levels  and  is  indicative  of  the  industry  sector  in  which  we 
operate.
