Gender Pay Gap 2016/2017

At Mulberry we are proud of our diverse workforce 
and believe fair and equal reward is vital to our 
success as an international luxury fashion business. 
We have a high degree of diversity across our team 
with a wide range of backgrounds, nationalities and 
ages employed across our different sites in the UK.

At a total level, the effect of a high proportion of 
women in manufacturing and retail roles has the 
effect of creating a male to female average pay gap. 
The company is committed to ensuring women 
progress to senior roles and maintaining equal pay for 
equivalent roles.

The team perform a variety of activities in the UK  
including design, manufacture, office and retail 
and are employed by two companies – Mulberry 
Company (Design) Limited and Mulberry Company 
(Sales) Limited. The majority of Mulberry’s team are 
female and we have a good representation of women 
in management positions across our business. We are 
confident that women and men are paid equally for 
doing equivalent jobs.

The gender pay gap analysis is based on data from 
April 2017 and, as required by the regulations, is split 
between our two main employing entities. Mulberry 
Company (Design) Limited employs 943 people and 
Mulberry Company (Sales) Limited employs 351 
people. 1,294 people in total.

I  confirm  that  the  figures  in  our  disclosure  are  accurate  and  
have  been  calculated  in  accordance  with  gender  pay  gap 
reporting  requirements  as  outlined  in  the  legislation  and 
accompanying guidance.
