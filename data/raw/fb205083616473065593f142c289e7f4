organisation employing 250 or more employees has to publicly report on its gender pay gap in six different ways: the mean and median gender pay gaps; the mean and median gender bonus gaps; the proportion of men and women who received bonuses, and the number of men and women according to quartile pay bands.  The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and women in an organisation. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees. The Gender Pay Gap is not the same as Equal Pay. Equal Pay is about differences in the actual earnings of men and women doing equal work. RINA Consulting Ltd. is an equal pay employer.
