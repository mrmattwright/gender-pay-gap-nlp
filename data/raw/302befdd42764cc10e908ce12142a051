The gender pay gap in flybmi is significantly influenced by the salaries and gender profile of our pilot and engineering teams, who make up 57% of its employees.  In common with the rest of the aviation industry, our pilots & engineers are predominately male and their salaries are high in relation to other flybmi employee groups.  This increases the gender pay gap at flybmi.                 BASIC SALARY AND VARIABLE PAY RATES OF OUR FEMALE PILOTS, CABIN CREW AND ENGINEERS IS  100%  Confirmed as accurate by Peter Simpson, Chief Executive – 29 March 2018    Notes:  Pay data for flybmi employees for the pay period including 05 April 2017 as specified by the UK regulations.  Pay calculations are based on FTE adjusted total pay received in the month of April 2017 and includes basic salary, allowances and sector pay net of salary sacrifice amounts that individual employees may elect to make through flybmi’s payroll, such as individual pension contributions.  Pay Calculations exclude overtime payments any benefits in kind.
