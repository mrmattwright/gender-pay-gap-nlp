Our history  UCC Coffee UK & Ireland has been operating in the UK coffee market for over 20 years, but we’ve not always been known by the same name.      In 2010, First Choice Coffee - the UK’s OOH coffee market leader - and Gala Coffee - the country’s largest retail own label roaster - merged to become United Coffee UK & Ireland and part of the United Coffee European Group.     Having operated independently, the combined strength of both businesses and ambitious growth plans, led to the transformation of United Coffee into the UK’s leading total coffee solution provider.     In 2012, United Coffee Group was acquired by UCC Holdings Co Ltd. (UCC) , to create one of the top five biggest independent coffee companies in the world. Following the acquisition, United Coffee retained its identity before rebranding as UCC Coffee UK & Ireland in 2014.     UCC is Japan’s largest producer of coffee and is responsible for £2bn annual sales turnover globally and 7,300 employees, including 30+ Q-graders and World Siphonist Champions. It supplies some of the world’s leading companies in retail, out of home and industrial markets and owns successful retail and out of home brands.  Tadeo Ueshima founded the Ueshima Coffee Company in 1933. UCC has a strong track record in innovation and has pioneered coffee culture in Japan for over 80 years.
Our European Head office is based in London with operations across 5 countries. Today, it’s a family-owned company with his grandson Mr. Gota Ueshima, Group CEO at the helm.  In the UK, we’re based in Milton Keynes with sites countrywide including one of Europe’s largest roasteries in Dartford, our niche roastery and training site in Corby and sites in Ireland and Huddersfield.                              Our partners   We work with some of the world’s leading equipment and product suppliers to deliver the Total Coffee Solution. Take a look for yourself.                                  Committed to ethical practices and keeping our planet green  We source certified sustainable coffees from farms and cooperatives across the world that are 100% traceable to origin. We offer a range of ethical credentials including Fairtrade , Rainforest Alliance and Soil Association and support UTZ and 4C certifications, making sure all our coffee is good for growers, the environment and our customers.  These aren’t just words, but a way of thinking that goes right across our business. We are dedicated to improving our resource efficiency through our entire supply chain. Our packaging is part of the Comply Direct compliance scheme, our machines are selected for their energy efficiency and we’re continually cutting carbon emissions from our fleet and roasteries.  We carefully select partners and suppliers who are as dedicated to the environment as we are. We even recycle all our water filters through our partner BRITA Professional,  that has recently achieved zero landfill status.  We are committed to ethical employment practices across our whole business and throughout our supply chain. Our annual statement, Modern Slavery Risk Analysis, Prevention and Control details our policies and procedures.                             Our community   We are totally committed to giving something back to the industry and the areas we operate in by supporting local charities and good causes.  Our ongoing support includes the Allegra Foundation, that provides clean drinking water and education to deprived communities in Africa through its Project Waterfall charity – our managing director is also a trustee.  Our Lyons Coffee brand has raised over £100,000 for The Royal British Legion since its re-launch in 2011, with a UCC team even cycling to Paris twice to raise even more. And we’ve recently donated packaging equipment to the Kyambura Women’s Coffee Cooperative in Uganda, which enables local women to improve their livelihoods by giving them ownership of over 1,500 coffee trees.  Our support doesn’t stop at coffee. UCC is represented on the Board of Governors of Ronald McDonald Birmingham House, that provides free ‘home away from home’ accommodation at hospitals across the UK. It’s close to our hearts, so we actively fundraise for the cause and other local charities through fun runs, tough man challenges and events.                             Be part of the team  Wherever you start your career with us, we’ll provide a great working environment, opportunities and experiences to help you progress. If you’ve only seen the coffee industry from inside a coffee shop, you might not be aware of the sheer number of roles we have available. This includes everything from engineers, call centre staff and sales, to baristas, trainers and coffee specialists.  We know people are the most important part of our business, so we really invest in them through up-skilling, training courses (we have over 650 of them available), internal moves and succession planning - all backed up with a range of rewards and benefits. And, while we know business is a serious issue, we understand that you need to have a bit of fun too.  We love our people and it shows - our team is one of the most engaged in the UK.
