Gender Pay Gap Reporting 

The Council is required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 and to 
publish the results on both the Council website and a Government website.  

The data captured is a snapshot based on information as at 5th April 2017.  All 
employers are required to publish information on their gender pay gap by 4 
April 2018 and thereafter the data will be updated and published each year.     

The data required relates to six calculations that show the difference between 
the average earnings of male and female employees.  It does not involve 
publishing individual employees data.   

The pay calculations are based on gross pay calculated before deductions at 
source.  “Pay” includes basic pay, paid leave, allowances, and shift pay.  It does 
not include any overtime pay, expenses, redundancy or any other termination 
pay.  

Gender Pay Reporting is established by capturing data from HR and payroll 
records from within the Council’s ResourceLink data system.  

The figures relate to centrally employed staff and do not include staff 
employed by schools.  Schools Governing bodies are required to publish their 
own data but only if they employ over 250 employees covered by the 
legislation. 

The duty to publish annual information relating to pay includes; 

  The difference in the mean and median pay of male and female 

employees; and 

  The numbers of male and female employees employed in quartile pay 

bands. 

In calculating the mean and median pay gap, employees who are not on full 
pay due to being on leave are excluded.   Leave includes maternity, paternity, 
adoption, parental and shared parental leave, sick leave, annual leave and 
special leave.  

Sefton’s figures relate to a total workforce of 3178 staff.  65% of which are 
females (2075) and 35% are males (1103).  In terms of employees holding 
multiple jobs each role performed would register separately.  Therefore in 

 

terms of one female employee with 2 distinct roles, the statistics would define 
two females with two distinct hourly rates of pay.     

SEFTON MEAN FIGURES 

The mean hourly rate is calculated by adding together all hourly rates and 
dividing by the number of employees 

Male Mean Hourly Rate = £ 13.71 

Female Mean Hourly Rate = £ 12.63 

Overall differential = £1.08.  The Mean gender pay gap is the overall 
differential represented as a percentage of the male mean hourly rate which 
equates to 7.88%. 

SEFTON MEDIAN FIGURES 

The median hourly rate represents is calculated by ranking all the various 
hourly rates from highest to lowest and simply selecting the mid figure.   

Male Median Hourly Rate = £ 11.58 

Female Median Hourly Rate = £ 10.29 

Overall differential = £1.29.  The Median gender pay gap is the overall 
differential represented as a percentage of the male median hourly rate 
which equates to 11.14%. 

Sefton’s pay gap figure of 7.88% mean and 11.14% median is acceptable 
when put in the context of the comparator figures of other employers and 
also taking into consideration that 65% of Sefton’s total workforce are 
female (totalling 2075) compared to 1103 male employees. 

Quartiles  

The statistics published rank employees into 4 quartiles from lowest hourly 
rate to highest hourly rate.  The quartiles are derived simply by dividing into 4 
sections each containing (so far as possible) an equal number of employees.  
The proportion of male and female employees in each quartile is published as 
a percentage.  Sefton’s figures are as follows;

SEFTON QUARTILE FIGURES 

  Of the top 50 highest earners in the Council as at 31.3.2017      26 were 

male and 24 were female. 

  There is a higher percentage of females than males in the Upper, Upper 

middle and Lower middle pay ranges. 

  There is a higher percentage of females than males in the lower pay 

range.  This group includes school crossing patrol employees and 
cleaners some of whom operate in multiple job roles.
