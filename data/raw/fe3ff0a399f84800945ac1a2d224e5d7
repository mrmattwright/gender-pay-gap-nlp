Charles Taylor UK Gender Pay Gap Report 2017       Gender pay gap report     Working to close the gender pay gap  Charles Taylor is a people business.  We recruit, retain and develop a broad range of highly skilled, technically excellent and highly motivated staff.  This year, in common with all UK businesses employing more than 250 people, we are reporting our gender pay gap figures.  Our gender pay gap is wider than we would like.  This is largely due to the high proportion of men historically employed in the insurance sector and the other industrial sectors from which Charles Taylor has typically recruited.  We believe that the transparency offered by publishing the gender pay gap is good; it informs our efforts to deliver our diversity and inclusion agenda.  Further, it supports our efforts to recruit, develop and retain the most talented staff, irrespective of age, gender, race or sexual orientation.
