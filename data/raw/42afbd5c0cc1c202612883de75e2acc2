AMG utilise an organisational Pay Rate system which covers all of our branches.  However, we have contracts within certain geographical areas that fall outside this where pay is enhanced.  We do find that we recruit males within these area’s ever so slightly better; whether due to the rate of pay or due to outside factors such as unemployment levels or the average pay of other sectors in the region.  This is the reason for both the slight variation in the Lower Middle and Upper Middle Quartiles and the Median Gender Pay Gap.  As stated above AMG is proud of the fact that females dominate all levels of management and as such a higher proportion of females are in position to receive a bonus.  However, the position attached to the largest bonus payment is currently occupied by a male incumbent.  This is the reason for the Mean Bonus Gender Pay Gap and therefore we do not feel that this is a gender issue.
