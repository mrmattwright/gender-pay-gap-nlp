Tullow is committed to improve the Group’s gender diversity especially at senior levels.  For example, our Inclusion and Diversity Plan is currently focussed on nationalities and gender with the intention to increase women and local Africans in senior technical and leadership roles across all Tullow locations. This is supported by good employee policies, benefits and recruitment practices.  Tullow continues to strive for an inclusive culture where everyone is treated fairly and equally. Tullow's Gender Pay Gap reporting can be found below, on the government website , and you can read more about it Tullow's Gender Pay Gap Report .  Pay & Bonus gaps       Women's hourly rate  Women's bonus pay     Lower (mean)  44%  53%    Lower (median)  49%  52%       Pay quartiles       Men  Women     Top quartile  90%  10%     Upper middle quartile  91%  9%     Lower middle quartile  65%  35%     Lower quartile  51%  49%      Response to the Davies Report  The Board currently consists of three Executive and six non-executive Directors. One of the six non-executive Directors is a woman but all of the Executive Directors are men, which translates to a low level of gender diversity.  The Board supports the aspirations set out in the 2011 Davies Report ‘Women on Boards’ that women should make up at least 25 per cent of board positions.
