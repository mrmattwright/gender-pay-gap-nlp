Therefore, we are required by the government to publish details of our gender pay gap - specifically the difference in average female and male earnings.    The data for Parkinson's UK is as follows:  Mean gender pay gap - 12.32%  Median gender pay gap - 5.99%  According to the Office of National Statistics, in October 2017 the current average pay gap is 17.4% across the whole economy.  Our gender pay gap is significantly lower than this and the sector average.  We are committed to eradicating it entirely over the coming years.  Our executive pay policy is overseen by our Nominations and Remuneration Committee and Board of Trustees, who conducted a thorough review of executive pay in 2016 using an external provider.  We are reviewing our benefits offering, and envisage a significant improvement in attracting candidates from a more diverse background, which will be seen in our quartile breakdown.  Parkinson's UK is committed to equality and diversity and we believe that it is an important part of creating a thriving and effective organisation.  All members of staff are recruited on merit, irrespective of gender or any other protected characteristics, and our benchmarked salary ranges are visible at the point of advertising.
