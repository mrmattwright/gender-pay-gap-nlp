We’ve grown from being a little town bakery, selling fresh bread to the people of Northwich, to a much bigger family bakery that feeds folk all across England and North Wales. Still based in Northwich, we now bake up around 3.5 million loaves every single week. You can see them rotating inside our brilliantly iconic, see-through cooling towers. If you’re in town, come and say hello!  Community has always been hugely important to us here at Roberts, and we try to support local causes in any way we can. From cooking lessons in schools to charitable grants, brass band fundraisers to huge charity bake-offs, we’re always up for new and exciting ways to get involved in our local community.            Charities we support  We provide ongoing support to three nominated charities every year, each chosen by the Roberts family. At least two of the charities selected are local, but we also welcome ad-hoc requests from other fundraisers and organisations. Our nominated charities for 2017 are:             The Children's Adventure Farm Trust  Based in Altrincham with facilities spread over 10 acres, CAFT brings a little light and fun into the lives of children who have known terrible hardships at such an early age.  Providing a variety of programmes for terminally ill, disabled and disadvantaged children, from all over the North West, each child who attends the Adventure Farm is treated as an individual with their own strengths, likes and dislikes, with disability never treated as a barrier to participation.   Find out more             Prevent Breast Cancer  The only UK charity entirely dedicated to the prediction and prevention of breast cancer, Prevent is committed to freeing the world from the disease altogether, making it avoidable for future generations, through focus on prevention rather than cure.  Through the promotion of early diagnosis, screening and advice on lifestyle changes, the charity also collaborates with others, such as the Manchester Breast Centre, to influence change in breast cancer services, and join up with the best experts in the field, which enables Prevent to remain at the forefront of the UK’s preventative research.   Find out more             St. Luke's Hospice  St Luke’s Hospice offers a wide range of services to support people living with life limiting illnesses in mid and south Cheshire. The focus is on caring, whether this be for symptom control, palliative care or through complementary therapies, individuals enter a positive environment, with professionals supporting the wide ranging needs of those visiting the centre, based in Winsford.  The charity also provides support for the families of patients, offering counselling, bereavement support and ‘time out’ activities.

We invite applications for food or small financial donations, from local organisations that fulfil the listed criteria. As a bakery, it’s always much easier for us to donate lots of lovely baked goodies, rather than offer financial support, so please bear that in mind. We only accept applications received through our website – we then look over all the requests on the first Monday of every month. Bear with us – we read every application very thoroughly, so please allow 4 weeks for your application to be processed.     Please read before you apply     Apply for charitable support  As a bakery based in the heart of a buzzing town, community has always been hugely important to us here at Roberts, and we try to support local causes in any way we can.
