Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

Reporting our gender pay gap

Reporting our gender pay gap

Introduction
Gender diversity has been a key priority for Standard Life 
plc and Aberdeen Asset Management plc over the last few 
years.  Both have strong foundations in place with actions 
supporting women at all career levels (early, mid, senior). In 
August 2017, we merged and became Standard Life Aberdeen, 
and have recommitted to improve gender diversity for our new 
organisation, setting new targets to accelerate this. 
Carrying out the gender pay gap analysis and understanding 
the reasons behind this has been critical for us.  We know our 
pay gap is primarily driven by the fact that we have more men 
than women in senior roles and certain parts of our business. 
We know that we have more to do to create opportunities for 
women to progress and to attract more women to or back to 
the industry.  And while we know this is something that many in 
our industry also experience, with an overall financial services 
gender pay gap of 35%1, we are determined to influence this 
across our company and industry.  
We are firmly committed to building on the work that we have 
already begun and accelerating the progress that we have 
made.  Achieving a more balanced workforce and so reducing 
our pay gap will take enduring commitment and focus.  We 
know we have more to do, and will continue to report regularly 
and transparently against these commitments. 

Methodology
Under the gender pay reporting regulations we are required 
to report data at a snapshot date of 5 April 2017 for each 
employing entity where we have more than 250 people. For 
us, this means five separate employing entities (you can find 
these on page 11).  At the snap shot date, Standard Life plc and 
Aberdeen Asset Management were two separate companies.  
We believe it is more meaningful to provide combined gender 
pay and bonus information for the reportable populations of 
Aberdeen Asset Management (Aberdeen Asset Management 
PLC and Aberdeen Asset Managers Ltd) and combined 
information for the reportable populations of the Standard 
Life Group (Standard Life Employee Services Ltd, Standard 
Life Investments Ltd and Elevate Portfolio Services Ltd). Our 
next gender pay report will provide a combined set of data for 
Standard Life Aberdeen, in this same way, reflecting our new 
company and continuing our commitment to transparency.

Under new legislation, 
UK companies with more 
than 250 employees have 
to report on their gender 
pay gap – the difference 
between the average 
amount that women and 
men are paid across the 
whole workforce.  The 
gender pay gap is not 
about equal pay for men 
and women doing the 
same job.  It’s a broad 
measure of gender 
equality in the workplace, 
or industry, or society.  
The gender pay gap can 
have many causes, such 
as low representation 
of women at senior 
levels or in certain roles.  
We believe increasing 
transparency is vital to 
start to close the gender 
pay gap and we welcome 
this legislation as a 
catalyst for change.

This means that 
as at April 2017, 
men were paid on 
average 34% more 
than women at 
Aberdeen and on 
average 42% more 
than women in the 
Standard Life group.

This highlights that our overall gender pay gap is driven mainly 
from the highest pay quartile, which is heavily male-dominated.  
Whereas in the other quartiles, which are more evenly gender 
balanced, pay gaps are 3% or less, or in favour of women.   
The unequal distribution of men and women through our 
business is the main driver of our gender pay gap.

Understanding our gender pay gap

1

Our industry
The Financial Services industry has the largest pay gap across all the UK’s 
industry sectors at 35%. There is a significant lack of women progressing 
through to senior roles which has a considerable impact on the gender 
pay gap for the industry. To achieve a balanced workforce at all levels 
in Financial Services and recognising the economic gains in closing the 
financial services gap, HM Treasury launched the Women in Finance Charter 
in 2016. At Standard Life Aberdeen we are committed to a better balanced 
workforce and believe in working across our industry to support actions 
that will address this. We were delighted to be among the first signatories 
to the Charter in 2016, pledging to increase gender balance in our senior 
management populations with specific targets, and so help reduce the 
gender pay gap across our company and industry.

Our analysis
We are confident our gender pay gap is not the result of a systemic equal 
pay issue, because our pay practices and design include regular gender 
checks and balances. We have carried out analysis to better understand 
the causes of our pay gap and inform the actions we take to tackle it. 
Our analysis of pay and bonus suggests any pay gap at different levels 
is predominantly driven by the structure of our workforce.  There are a 
number of things which influence our gender pay gap:
 ¬ a higher proportion of men in our senior roles and in certain parts of 

our business which attract higher market value 

 ¬ a higher proportion of women than men in our more junior roles 
We have pay gaps of 3% or less at the lower three pay quartiles, with larger 
gaps of 17 and 26 percent at the upper (highest paid) quartile. As these 
more granular pay gaps are much lower than the overall pay gap, we know 
that the unequal distribution of men and women is the main driver for our 
gender pay gap.
While we have 47% women across our total UK population, our 
representation at different levels decreases further up the organisation, and 
we have 27% women in our senior leadership roles.  
We have had targets in place for the representation of women in senior roles 
since 2016.  However our CEOs have now recommitted to new targets for 
Standard Life Aberdeen to accelerate our progress and focus.

Women in Finance 
Charter commitments

Gender bonus gap
Our mean and median bonus gaps are higher than our gender 
pay gaps. The structure of our workforce is also influencing our 
bonus gaps. The gap is affected by:
 ¬ our senior level roles or specific parts of our business have 
larger bonus opportunities, and these roles are mainly held 
by men

 ¬ the way the legislation sets out bonus pay gap calculations 
does not take into account the fact that we pro-rate bonus 
for our people who work reduced hours, the majority of 
whom are female

We have committed 

to increasing our 
representation of 
women at different 
levels, by June 2020.

Tackling our gender pay gap

Achieving a better gender balance at all levels (and 
therfore improving our gender pay gap), is a priority for our 
organisation. We believe this drives sustainable progress, and 
while this approach takes time, it is equitable and supports 
our commitment to long term careers.  This is about really 
understanding how organisational culture, expectations and 
practices in our sector impact on women and men. And it’s also 
about having the right actions in place to address this from 
different aspects, and holding our senior leaders to account to 
accelerate progress. For this reason, our CEOs own our gender 
diversity action plan, and our Nomination and Governance 
Committee formally oversee progress every 6 months.

Our actions are making a difference. 
Our strong gender balanced pipeline 
continues to grow; 44% of those in 
our talent pool who are considered 
capable of operating at Executive 
Committee level in the next three 
to five years are female and our 
2017 graduate intake is 54% 
female and from a broad range 
of universities.  

by 2020.

    In addition to Martin Gilbert 
and Keith Skeoch being 

executive sponsors of our Women 

In Finance Charter targets, they 
have signed up to the 30% Club 
pledge for FTSE 100 and 250 CEOs 
and have already set a higher than 
recommended target of 33% female 

representation in senior leadership  

The gender pay gap is a complex issue with a variety of 
overlapping causes, and so it’s unlikely to be successfully 
tackled by one initiative or activity.  We know this isn’t 
straightforward, and it won’t happen overnight, but we’re 
committed to keep pushing for change and championing 
this at all levels in our business.  Our CEO-owned actions are 
focused on addressing our gender balance from three  
different aspects.
