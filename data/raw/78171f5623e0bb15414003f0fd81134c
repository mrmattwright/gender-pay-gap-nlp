Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees and shows the difference in average pay and bonus between all men and women.  This is different to equal pay, Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, and more recently, the Equality Act 2010, it is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. At Vent-Axia there are no differences in pay rates for different genders occupying equivalent or similar roles.  Vent-Axia data  Vent-Axia is a division of Volution Group Plc and operates within the ventilation sector. The gender pay gap report is based on data as of the 5 th April 2017. At this date Vent-Axia employed 308 staff with 221 (72%) being male and 87 (28%) being female.  Pay and Bonus Gap  Mean*  Median**  Hourly Fixed Pay  29.6%  23.8%  Paid Bonus  81.2%  75.4%   * The mean is the average of a list of numbers. ** The median is the middle value in all of the numbers listed in numerical order.  What the data tells us?  Figures above show our gender pay gap as a snapshot at April 2017. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly pay of all women compared to men irrespective of their role or level in Vent-Axia. Our figures show that the median average pay of all of women in the UK is 23.8% lower than that of men. The hourly pay figure used to calculate the difference includes allowances and shift pay.  Our figures show that the median average pay of all of women in the UK is 23.8% lower than that of men.  Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile  The workforce is portioned into evenly sized quartiles based on ranking of all full-pay individuals from highest to lowest by hourly rate of pay. The following charts show the number of full-pay male and females in each quartile as a percentage of the total in the quartile.    Lower Quartile    Lower Middle    Upper Middle    Upper Quartile            There are no differences in pay rates for different genders occupying equivalent roles  Employees that work unsociable night shift hours are generally male, and this attracts a higher pay rate  Vent-Axia are actively seeking to address the discrepancy in male/female employees in the upper middle and upper quartile pay bands  We have a  pay gap relating to bonus payments. The majority of bonus payments in our business are sales commissions and currently a majority of our sales team is male.
