We also support working parents and parents getting back to work through flexible working.  Our team maintains a neutral position on gender and pay so when it comes to selection there is a fair outcome for everyone at all levels of the business.  In line with the regulations set out in the Gender Pay Gap reporting legislation we have calculated our figures which are outlined in this report . Compared to the UK’s median gender pay gap of 18.2%, the median gender pay gap at Apex Hotels is 2.5%.  This reflects the average paid to men and women across our business. It’s not a comparison of pay rates for men and women doing work of equal value.
