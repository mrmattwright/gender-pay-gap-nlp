London Business School | Inclusion and Diversity Annual Report January 2018Introduction

Inclusion and diversity have always been a 
cornerstone of London Business School’s (LBS) 
values and we pride ourselves on being an institution 
that welcomes people from all backgrounds, 
countries, cultures, identities and orientations.

The 150,000 individuals from 130 countries who have studied 
and worked at LBS over the years are members of a diverse 
global community that continues to flourish.

This report, our seventh since the introduction of the Public 
Sector Equality Duty of the Equality Act in 2010, celebrates 
our inclusive and diverse community.

It also highlights progress we have made in the past year 
and the continued efforts we are making to strengthen our 
diversity and inclusiveness. For example, we aim to address 
our gender pay gap – one largely based on horizontal and 
vertical job segregation – with concentrated recruitment 
efforts. 

We are appointing a Director of Inclusion and Diversity, a new 
role that will operate at the heart of our School, to support 
our ongoing efforts. Drawing on the strength of our eclectic, 
engaged and ambitious community, our aim is to have a 
profound impact on the way the world does business.

Values

●● Communal

Our values and vision
 
Our values are more than just words on a page – they reflect and embody 
the character, energy and spirit of our organisation. We take inspiration 
from London, a city famous for multi-culturalism and openness. We 
draw strength from the global mindset that comes from being a truly 
international community. Indeed, our values of Communal and Engaged 
are core to the principle of inclusiveness; our value Eclectic reflects our 
commitment to attracting the best people regardless of their sex, race, 
age, gender orientation or physical ability; and our inclusion and diversity 
goals reflect our value Ambitious, supporting our aim to be excellent.  
It is these qualities that we believe are vital to realising our vision: to have 
a profound impact on the way the world does business.

Inclusion and diversity activity

Inclusion and diversity activity

Below are some of the highlights against our goals.

The School has promoted improvements in areas affecting 
female staff, students and faculty. These include:

Race

The Dean of London Business School, François 
Ortalo-Magné, is prioritising inclusion and diversity. A new 
Director of Inclusion and Diversity, reporting to the Dean, will 
spearhead our activities.

Sex

Action has been taken to increase the proportion of 
applications from female faculty shortlisted for interview for 
tenure-track faculty positions. Our aim is that 25%–35% of 
the candidates invited for interview are female and we have 
exceeded this figure for the second year running. In addition, 
senior female hires have been made, enhancing the number 
of tenured female faculty at London Business School. A 
number of faculty have benefited from the new provisions 
put in place on the recommendation of the Family-Friendly 
Taskforce, to support early and mid-career faculty. 

Women applying to study at the School can choose to be 
directly connected with members of the Women in Business 
club. This initiative, introduced in 2016, is an effective way 
to encourage women to apply. The percentage of women 
entrants to the PhD programme in 2017 was the highest ever 
at 47%, enhancing the pipeline of future female academics.

In October 2011, we revealed our target to increase the 
number of women for each MBA intake to at least 30%. This 
aim was in line with the 30% Club’s goal to get more women 
onto UK corporate boards. This year, we have increased the 
percentage of women on the MBA to 37%.

●● providing family friendly facilities on campus and in the 

new Sammy Ofer Centre

●● enhancing scholarships for prospective female students

●● using classroom case studies with female protagonists

We are developing more effective recruitment monitoring 
systems and working to raise the profile of ethnic minority 
groups within the School. Faculty recruitment recommends 
positive action towards ethnic minority candidates in the 
shortlisting process. Intercultural awareness is embedded in 
student orientation and staff development.

●● teaching evaluations being broken down by sex 

Disability

●● covering equality and diversity in student orientation.

Sexual orientation and gender identity

The School supports its lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and 
transgender + (LGBTQ) community by fostering an 
environment where everyone is welcome. Two years ago, 
LBS became the first European business school to offer a 
Reaching Out Fellowship, a bursary to support those who 
help the LGBTQ community. The School is now proud to 
have two MBA scholars who are recipients of this award.

If they wish, applicants to the School can be connected with 
members of the Out in Business (OIB) club. Feedback shows 
that this approach has worked well. Members of the LGBTQ 
community have been recognised by the national press, with 
Nick Deakin, previous co-president of the Out in Business 
club, named in the top five of the Financial Times’s 2016 
OUTstanding LGBT + Future Leaders list. 

We continue to partner with 
DisabledGo, whose mission is to give 
disabled people more independence 
by providing building access 
information. 

Age

Age differences have been factored into staff recruitment 
and retention planning, using data to explore generational 
issues and develop policies for attracting a more age-diverse 
workforce.

London Business School | Inclusion and Diversity Annual Report January 2018The Diversity Working Group

The Diversity Working Group (DWG) drives initiatives 
to develop inclusion and diversity within London 
Business School. The DWG reports to Management 
Board, which is accountable for our diversity strategy 
and activities.

Students, staff and faculty are represented on 
the DWG.

Diversity Working Group

Activity in 2017 

Our focus in 2017 was on increasing the number of female 
applicants from prospective students and faculty (see p6 for 
details).

We placed more emphasis on communications, leading to 
an increase in inclusion and diversity issues featuring in the 
School’s internal and external communications. 

We celebrated United Nations International Women’s 
Day with a lecture for staff, faculty and students from 
Assistant Professor Eliot Sherman about how motherhood 
responsibilities contributed to gender inequality in the 
workplace.

Our goals

1  Increase the number of applications from female 

candidates, with the aim of boosting the proportion of 
female faculty and students on all programmes.

2  Promote an ethos where all are welcome whatever 

their sexual orientation and gender identity. Encourage 
applications from students, staff and faculty within the 
LGBTQ community.

3  Develop a more ethnically diverse workforce and 

student body and encourage further participation from 
ethnic minorities throughout the School community.

4  Build an understanding of disability within the School 

and identify areas for development.

5  Build understanding of generational differences and 
identify areas for development in order to attract and 
retain an age-diverse workforce.

 ■ Eliot Sherman, Assistant Professor of Organisational 

Behaviour: Gender inequality: where are all the men?

 ■ Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, Professor of Strategy and 
Entrepreneurship: Gender parity: the pipeline problem

Dr Sherman’s work finds that after advances in terms of 
women entering the workplace and the pay gap narrowing, 
progress seems to have stalled and gender parity is still a 
way off. Encouraging more men into the debate could help 
bring it closer. Social norms around male caregiving need to 
change. “Until more men leave the office early to collect their 
child, we are unlikely to see a meaningful shift in the number 
of women in executive roles,” Dr Sherman says.

 ■ Behind every successful woman 

In this short film – part of the Rethinking Leadership 
campaign – Dr Sherman explores the crucial role of men in 
overturning a system that stops women, especially at the 
top and bottom of the pay scale, from achieving their full 
potential at work.

Below: Gender inequality: where are all the men?  
Right: The 100-Year Life

On the path to gender parity we need to look beyond the 
top, says Professor Isabel Fernandez-Mateo. The term 
“glass-ceiling” was coined more than 30 years ago and 
it is often assumed that the barriers become higher the 
higher you go up the organisation. But work from Professor 
Fernandez-Mateo shows the glass ceiling starts much earlier 
in the chain. She says: “Top management is still a man’s 
business with women accounting for less than 16.9% of top 
executives and directors in Fortune 500 firms, and only 5.2% 
of CEOs, despite representing 40% of the workforce.” 

 ■ Lynda Gratton, Professor of Management Practice, 

and Andrew Scott, Professor of Economics:  
The 100-Year Life 

Professor Gratton’s work has examined practices in the 
workplace, such as flexible working in the context of gender 
and her latest project, The 100-Year Life with London 
Business School Professor of Economics, Andrew Scott, 
explores the impact of an ageing population on business. 

Faculty research

Faculty have built an impressive body of research 
that increases awareness and understanding of the 
benefits of inclusion and diversity in business – as 
well as identifying challenges that stop such benefits 
being realised.

There were 10 new pieces of research focusing on inclusion 
and diversity during the period covered by this annual report.

They increase the body of existing research by London 
Business School faculty: 17 faculty have produced 42 papers 
on the theme of gender equality. 

 ■ Aneeta Rattan, Assistant Professor of Organisational 

Behaviour: When stereotypes collide

What happens when two conflicting stereotypes come into 
play? Can a differential emphasis on aspects of the same 
person’s identity – such as being female and Asian – affect 
how much male evaluators discriminate in a hiring context? 
Astonishingly, the answer is yes according to Dr Aneeta 
Rattan. She says: “We socially categorise people almost 
the instant we come across them, often unconsciously and 
without even realising we’re doing it. Interpersonal perception 
can depend on which aspects of someone’s identity are 
salient.”

 ■ Raina Brands and Isabel Fernandez-Mateo:  

 ■ Selin Kesibir, Assistant Professor of Organisational 

Organisational Behaviour and Margaret Ormiston: 
Is leading a team of individuals an oxymoron?

Some assume that the best way to end discrimination is by 
ignoring differences and treating individuals as equally as 
possible, without regard to culture, ethnicity or race. In fact, 
recognising and cherishing people’s differences satisfies 
their individual needs far more than ignoring them, according 
to Dr Sivanathan and Dr Margaret Ormiston, Assistant 
Professor of Management at George Washington University. 
Managing diversity is less about turning a blind eye and 
more about embracing difference.

How to stop women leaning out 

Behaviour: She or he 

Two LBS experts investigate why women are less likely than 
men to put themselves forward for leadership roles. They 
find that women don’t scale back their goals and shy away 
from competing because, as has often been assumed, they 
are risk-averse or lacking in confidence. Rather, they are less 
likely to apply for these jobs if they have previously been 
rejected for a similar job.

Dr Kesebir’s research shows how our use of language 
reflects and influences perceptions of gender roles. 
Language can alter people’s viewpoints, she explains – if 
we choose our words with care. “By ordering words one 
way rather than the other, we conjure up a particular mental 
model in the minds of our audiences – either reinforcing an 
existing stereotype or slightly puncturing it.” 

 ■ Rajesh Chandy, Professor of Marketing:  

So hire me: how diversity of experience adds value 

 ■ Raina Brands, Assistant Professor of Organisational 

Behaviour: The gender pay gap: do women have a 
sporting chance? 

Professor Chandy states that in changing times, companies 
need to look beyond their present expertise and seek to hire 
team members with a diversity of experience. 

Dr Brands examines the continuing gender pay gap in sport 
and business and makes the case for organisational change.

Nick Deakin named LGBTQ leader and ally

Bespoke programme for senior women in banking launched

London Business School alumnus Nick Deakin was 
named in the Financial Times’ 2017 OUTstanding list 
for achieving career success and creating supportive 
workplaces for LGBTQ people. 

Deakin, Investment Banking Associate at Citi, was 

ranked 12th in the Top 50 Future Leaders, having also appeared in last 
year’s list. 

The FT list recognises aspiring leaders across the world who are a success 
in their own right, influential within their sector and who are role models for 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual (LGBTQ) community.

Before graduating with an MBA in 2017, Deakin was co-president of the 
School’s Out in Business Club, which organises EUROUT, Europe’s largest 
LGBTQ conference.

LBS Professor joins UN Women UK board

Randall S Peterson, Professor of Organisational 
Behaviour at London Business School, has joined the 
board of UN Women UK as a trustee. 

The organisation is the UK representative of a global 
association that champions gender equality and 

empowers women through advocacy, raising awareness and fundraising. 

Professor Peterson brings fresh perspectives on diversity in business to the 
organisation. He will help raise UN Women UK’s profile to appeal to a wider 
audience and assist with fundraising activities to help improve the lives of 
women and girls throughout the world. 

Katie Coates, client director in Executive Education at London Business School, 
explains the initiative:

“Executive Education worked with Deutsche Bank to create a Women Global Leaders 
programme designed for director-level women across the Bank. 50 women took part 
in the first cohort, with subsequent cohorts planned for 2018”.

Two Reaching Out MBA Fellowships awarded

The Reaching Out MBA Fellowship is a joint effort between Reaching Out and 
London Business School. Its aim is to empower lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
queer, and ally (LGBTQA) MBA students to become professionals who will lead the 
way to equality in business education, in the workplace and throughout society. The 
scholarship of £20,000 is open to all MBA admits.

Simon Ellis MBA2019 is the second recipient. He says: “I had lots of opportunities to engage with 
London Business School before I was admitted and I knew I wanted to come here from the start. 
There’s a really good balance between study, career and other opportunities, and London is where I 
want to work after the MBA. 

“Diversity is front and centre of how London Business School positions itself to students. It really does 
make a difference in class to have so many perspectives and people with varied experiences taking part 
in the discussion. 

“The fellowship sends out a strong message – this is something we recognise, something we are 
committed to. LBS is one of only two schools outside the US that offers it. For the School to go out of 
its way to become part of this wider network, showing it’s an institution that appreciates and promotes 
diversity, really mattered to me. Personally, the financial assistance that comes with the fellowship is the 
difference between an uncomfortable level of debt to fund the MBA and something more manageable. 
And it is about more than the money. You gain access to a wide network of highly motivated and 
talented peers, mainly in the US. There’s also an optional mentor scheme, which has allowed me to talk 
to someone outside the LBS bubble about issues related to coming out at work. The fellowship puts us 
in the club of schools pushing this inclusive agenda and I am really proud to be part of it.”

Our scholarships have helped raise the number of women on all LBS programmes. 
Scholarships for women include the School’s 50th Anniversary Scholarship for Women, the 
Forte Foundation Fellowships, and the Nestle Emerging Market Scholarships for Women. We 
also offer the Monica and Navin Valrani Scholarship to support exceptionally talented Indian 
women and the Muna Al Gurg Scholarship for female candidates from the Middle East. 

Recent scholarships for all include the Reaching Out MBA Fellowship, which aims to 
champion equality in business education, in the workplace and throughout society by offering 
financial support to LGBTQ candidates and to those who support the LGBTQ community. 

The Student Association, which represents LBS community members’ 
interests and concerns, provides more than 75 student clubs and 
bodies that act as a vital support network to students from around 
the world. Meanwhile, our student ambassadors help potential and 
new students understand what life is like at LBS. The LBS Families 
Initiative has recently been set up to connect students from different 
countries and backgrounds who have common interests. To date more 
than 260 students from across all programmes have signed up. The School also provides a 
comprehensive careers service, guidance on moving to London, a club for people’s partners 
and formal counselling and support services. 

There are several international scholarships such as the African Scholarship, the LIFE 
Scholarship for residents of Lebanon and the LBS Latin America Scholarship. 

Counselling

We offer free, confidential services to help students with any personal or professional 
problems. The School employs a confidential counsellor who is available to talk through 
any issues.  

Disabilities

The School’s disability officer continues to provide a dedicated service for students with a 
range of disabilities. Students with long-term medical conditions that impact their studies can 
contact our disability support for information, advice and support. By disability we mean any 
impairment, medical condition, mental health issue or specific learning difficulty that affects 
someone’s ability to study, or any other aspect of their student life.

Accessibility 

We continue to partner with DisabledGo, whose mission is to maximise independence and 
choice for disabled people by publishing access information. Providing access for disabled 
people is specifically factored into the Estates Policy, and has been a priority within the 
recent development of our campus and opening of Sammy Ofer Centre.

Access and support

Support for staff and faculty

Our aim is to make our working environment as welcoming and inclusive as possible. To that 
end we invest in providing support to staff, faculty and students, as well as ensuring we can 
be as accessible as possible.

Employee assistance scheme

The School offers free counselling services and practical support to 
staff and faculty through Workplace Wellness, our external Employee 
Assistance Programme. The School offers staff and faculty a wide 
range of benefits including generous maternity leave, shared parental 
and paternity leave and childcare vouchers. Time off for volunteering, a generous holiday 
entitlement and flexible working scheme are also provided to help employees strike a 
healthy work-life balance. 

Support has been offered to staff and faculty in respect of their physical, mental and 
financial wellbeing throughout the year with regular articles in Life@LBS and engagement 
activities such as the LBS Employee Benefits Fair, promotion of engagement days such as 
Mental Health Awareness Day, and regular workshops to promote wellbeing across these 
three key areas.

The Student Association

Out In Business Club

London Business School is a place full 
of vibrant diversity, intellectual curiosity 
and amazing people, says Joshua 
Chakravarty, President of the School’s 
Student Association. 

“This definitely played a role in my 
decision to come here and that is true 
for many others. There are almost 70 different nationalities 
represented in my class, meaning we’re exposed to a wealth 
of different influences both inside and outside the classroom. 
The diversity is part of the global learning experience here. 

“The 21 regional clubs are very important in making all this 
accessible and – unlike at many other business schools – 
they are all free to join and open to all students. We are very 
proud to welcome everyone into our clubs and share our 
experiences. 

“We also place a lot of focus on our Women in Business 
club – our largest club on campus – and the Out in Business 
club – which hosts Europe’s largest conference for LGBTQ 
MBAs and allies. Of course, all of this inclusivity extends to 
our partners and families.”

A dual national of Australia and New Zealand with 
Bangladeshi heritage, Joshua says: “I’ve grown up in a 
world that’s more global than ever and I want to keep 
learning and exploring so that we develop and strengthen 
our understanding across cultures. LBS gives us that Global 
mindset.”

Out In Business Club, the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender and Queer 
network at London Business 

School, celebrated its 20th anniversary last year and now 
has a record 900+ members. It was nominated for the 
European Diversity Awards 2017 Community Project of the 
Year. The first Coming Out Day was held in autumn 2017, 
when club members shared stories in the classroom of 
why they were actively engaged in building inclusive and 
welcoming environments in their communities. Classmates 
were encouraged to come out as allies by using stickers, 
nameplates and LGBTQ ally cards, which were also displayed 
in the new Sammy Ofer Centre lounge. Having been involved 
in the launch of the first European MBA LGBTQ scholarship 
at LBS, the Out in Business Club has welcomed two 
Fellowship holders to the MBA programme (see News p10).

EUROUT

EUROUT’s annual conference, 
the largest event of its kind in 
Europe, is also breaking records. 

“We are positioned as the most inclusive business school in 
the world as a consequence of the EUROUT Conference,” 
says Albert Saniger, MBA2018 and chair of this year’s event.

“I went to Chicago and met the presidents of LGBTQ 
clubs from 50 of the top business schools and we shared 
information about best practices, our activities, the 
percentages of people who identify as LGBTQ and so on and 
LBS is ahead in all these areas. 

“I started doing some 
research and EUROUT is 
the main reason why we’re 
seen as leaders. The US 
equivalent is ROMBA, which 
was started 20 years ago by 
Harvard and Yale. Now it’s 
an incorporated identity with 
full-time staff and around 
1,600 people show up from 
all over the world – LGBTQ 
MBAs who want to work in 
the US. ROMBA is supported by 10 business schools. We 
invite LGBTQ MBAs from business schools around the world, 
but its widely known as the event organised by LBS students. 
This positions the School as the strongest supporter of 
inclusion and diversity in the workplace. 

“It was a deciding factor in my choosing LBS. I knew 
because of EUROUT I could really add value. We raised 
a record amount in 2017 (double that of 2016) from sponsors 
and tickets. There were fantastic speakers, 50 companies 
represented and 400 people who came from around the 
world. People recognise that a key aspect of LBS is that it is 
diverse and inclusive.”

The line-up for the 2017 EUROUT Conference, Bridging 
the Gap, included keynote speakers such as Sue Y Nabi, 
Founder of Orveda and former President of L’Oreal and 
Lancôme; Deborah Sherry, Chief Commercial Officer of GE 
Digital; and Andy Maguire, Group MD and Group COO at 
HSBC. The event included panel discussions on careers 
in finance, technology and consulting, a women’s lunch 
sponsored by McKinsey, and a careers fair showcasing more 
than 50 worldwide employers.

Regional clubs

The Women in 
Business (WIB) club 
is one of the biggest 
clubs on campus, 
covering everything 

All 21 regional clubs encourage students to engage with 
their activities to promote understanding and enjoyment of 
the many cultures represented at London Business School. 
The clubs are free to join and welcome a multicultural 
member base for students and alumni. 

Student Association president Josh Chakravarty MBA2019 
says: “As a student here you might start the week hearing 
from a prominent Russian CEO and end the week at a US 
Thanksgiving dinner! All of these events culminate in Tattoo 
when we bring together national performances and foods in 
a celebration of our diversity. Last year the Africa club won 
the dance competition and it was fantastic to see a truly 
multicultural team share this cultural learning experience.”

There are about 1,500 events planned for the 2017–18 
academic year.

to be an inspiring and engaging event, helping attendees 
grow their networks and raising awareness of potential 
role models, mentors and sponsors across a large range of 
industries. 

Keynote speakers included Vivian Hunt, Head of UKI for 
McKinsey; Joanna Cound, Head of Government Relations

CMO for Farfetch; and Helen Watson, CEO for Rothschild 
Wealth Management UK. 

WIB wants to engage and involve everyone in helping to 
improve gender diversity – both in the workplace and on 
campus. Men now make up 40% of the WIB executive 
committee so that the wider LBS community’s views are 
represented and to develop effective partnerships and 
ambassadors.

The Community Action Group

The School Plan emphasises the importance of the Community 
Action Group (CAG), which continues to co-ordinate 
volunteering activity in the local community. Our focus is on 
Church Street Ward. This is a very diverse area in terms of 
language, race, religion and economic status. It is one of 
the poorest wards in the country, with significant levels of 
deprivation. The CAG has supported the local community in the 
past year by:

●● providing paid internships and mentoring the unemployed 

and teenagers

●● teaching financial literacy to children and adults and teaching 

children about enterprise

●● hosting the Youth Enrichment Programme: a series of faculty-

led lectures for sixth formers from four local academies

●● organising interactive/social workshops for vulnerable women

●● establishing a reading improvement programme for primary-

school children

●● holding social activities for senior citizens at risk of isolation 

and loneliness

●● working on renovation and gardening projects for local 

estates

●● organising an annual toy drive for local hospitals and children 

in need of support.

Training and development  
opportunities for staff

We are clear that we draw strength and ideas 
from our cultural diversity and we’re committed to 
ensuring all new members of our community share 
our values. We explain and promote this to new 
staff, faculty and students as part of their orientation 
training soon after they join us. 

More than 140 members of staff attended orientation in the 
2016–17 academic year.

Staff and faculty receive e-learning inclusion and diversity 
training during their inductions. The training has a high 
uptake and receives positive feedback from participants. 
More than 550 staff members have completed the diversity 
in the workplace module.

Diversity is also embedded within the School’s management 
development activities for staff.

has been completed by more than 60 people since it was 
introduced in 2015. The course helps participants to develop 
the intercultural awareness needed to uphold professional 
standards of behaviour and engage with customers, 
stakeholders and colleagues from different cultures.

The Executive Education Customer Experience team 
has introduced an online resource that provides practical 
information on some 85 countries and develops people’s 
cultural intelligence on those nations.

Appendix 1: background to the report and remit of monitoring

This report is written in accordance with the Public 
Sector Equality Duty of the Equality Act 2010. 

The report provides data on our key constituencies: faculty, 
staff, students and participants from our Executive Education 
open programmes. It also illustrates our progress and 
achievements since January 2017.

Remit of monitoring

Notes on the data

The equality monitoring information in Appendix 3 includes 
available statistical data on staff, faculty, students and 
participants who have attended Executive Education open 
programmes.

We collect data that covers the following protected 
characteristics where possible:
 ■ sex
●■ race
●■ disability 
●■ age

This data demonstrates our position as of 1 October 2017. 
The monitoring of equality characteristics is likely to be 
extended to cover other protected qualities in next year’s 
report, leading to a more detailed analysis of our workforce 
and student body. 

●● We are pleased to have data from the recruitment and 
selection process for staff and faculty for the second 
consecutive year.

●● An integrated central HR solution was introduced last 

year, helping us to collect more detailed and higher quality 
data on a range of issues.

●● We have again reported on the profile of participants 

from Executive Education open programmes. This area 
is outside the remit of the Higher Education Statistics 
Agency (HESA) and, as in last year’s report, only 
information about age and gender has been collected.

●● Due to the relatively small size of the School, some 

information has not been published in this report 
to protect the identity of some individuals. HESA 
recommendations have been followed to avoid disclosing 
any individual’s personal information. Numbers have 
therefore been rounded to the nearest multiple of five. 
This methodology should be taken into account when 
examining the statistics provided in Appendix 3.

Commentary

The data in Appendix 3 
reflects the information 
available for the School 
population as of 1 October 
2017, and covers students, 
staff and faculty. HESA 
categories and terminology 
have been used. Data shown 
for Executive Education 
refers to open programme 
participants.

Recruitment statistics are also 
included for staff and faculty. 
Analysis of the data allows 
the School to gain a deeper 
understanding of how effective 
recruitment practices are at 
encouraging diversity, and 
identifies any areas for further work 
and development.

We have made some progress in 
increasing diversity since the last 
annual report and we hope that as 
we increase our focus further, we’ll 
have an even greater impact in the 
future.

Sex

 ■ Progress has been made over 
the last year in increasing the 
proportion of female students, 
which has risen from 32% to 
34%. The percentage of female 
students has increased every 
year since this report started to 
be published seven years ago.

 ■ There is significant variation 

in the student gender split 
between programmes. The 
Masters in Management (MiM), 
MBA, EMBA Global Asia and 
PhD programmes have relatively 
high proportions of female 
students with the MiM reaching 
46%, whereas the Sloan 
programme stands at 21%.
 ■ The proportion of female to 

male staff has fallen slightly to 
67% female, 33% male. The 
proportion of female staff is 
still higher than the sector as a 
whole, where 62.7% of staff are 
female.

 ■ The proportion of men is higher 

at the application stage, at 
39%, and the same percentage 
of male candidates reached 
interview and 29% received 
offers.

 ■ Although there are now 

 ■ 49% of students are black and 

 ■ 53% of applicants for faculty 

Race

positions are BME, and 60% of 
interviewees were from a BME 
background, giving a strong 
indication that subject areas are 
using positive action to diversify 
the interview pool (up from 50% 
the previous year).

significantly fewer female staff 
at level 1 (from 33% to 9%) 
there are also fewer female 
members of staff at the highest 
level (from 60% to 52%).

 ■ There are significantly more 
male staff members working 
part time than in the previous 
year. This appears to reflect 
the changing nature of work 
and how we, as an inclusive 
employer, can be accessible 
and meet employees’ needs. 

 ■ The proportion of female faculty 
has remained the same at 24%. 
This remains higher than a 
number of other top business 
schools, both nationally and 
internationally2.

 ■ As a result of internal 

promotions and the hiring 
of key senior appointments, 
the proportion of female full 
professors has increased from 
11% to 20%.

minority ethnic (BME). This 
remains significantly higher 
than the sector average, which 
was 23.6% for those with 
Taught Higher Degrees (HESA 
2015–16).

 ■ BME staff numbers have 

slightly increased from 26% to 
27% of the overall population, 
compared to a sector average 
of 8.9%.

 ■ Despite a drop in the number 

of BME applicants for staff 
positions, the number of BME 
candidates interviewed has 
gone up from 43% to 46%. The 
number offered a position has 
increased from 31% to 35%.

 ■ 20% of faculty are BME, 

with the largest ethnic group 
comprising of Asian or Asian 
British-Indian who account for 
10% of the faculty population.

Disability

Age

 ■ 3% of students have declared 
a disability. It is hoped that the 
introduction of a more targeted 
disability advice service may 
see this figure move closer to 
the sector norm in forthcoming 
years.

 ■ 2% of staff have declared a 
disability. This figure reflects 
the applicant pool of which 2% 
of applicants for staff positions 
declared a disability.

 ■ After rounding, 100% of faculty 

have declared no known 
disability. The applicant pool 
again reflects this statistic.

 ■ 65% of students are aged 

25–34. The age split between 
programmes reflects, as 
expected, the career stage of 
students, although PhD and 
Sloan students are slightly 
younger than in previous years.

 ■ The staff population remains 
young, with the proportion of 
staff in the 25–34 age range 
accounting for 45% of full-time 
staff.

 ■ 45% of applicants for staff roles 
fell in this age group, indicating 
that the applicant pool is closely 
aligned with the current staff 
make-up.

 ■ 57% of faculty are aged 30 to 

44 and 15% of faculty are aged 
over 60. 2% of staff are aged 
over 60.

What is the gender pay gap?

Staff gender pay gap

Faculty gender pay gap

All-employee gender pay gap

Progress in 2017 

The gender pay gap is defined 
as the difference in the average 
earnings of men and women over 
a standard time period. We’re 
required to provide data calculated 
in line with the Equality Act 2010 
methodology. The figures represent 
hourly pay rates and we have to 
report our two distinct employee 
groups (staff and faculty) together. 

The staff gender pay gap is 7.2%, 
against a national average of 18.4% 
(Office for National Statistics). Our 
pay gap reflects:

1  The high proportion of women 
(67%) distributed across all job 
levels within the organisation but 
with more men at senior levels.

2  The high proportion of women 

(86%) in the ‘Administrative 
Operations’ job category that 
represents one-third of job roles 
and have lower rates of pay than 
other professional or technical 
roles. 

The faculty gender pay gap is 
14.2%. This reflects:

1  The high proportion of men 
in senior ranks: 80% of full 
professors are men. This is 
similar to other top business 
schools.

2  The small number of women 

entering academia in the higher 
paid subject areas.

The overall pay gap is 23.3%. This 
is higher than both staff and faculty 
pay gaps for two key reasons.

1  Faculty pay is much higher than 

staff pay. 

2  We have a higher proportion of 
women among our staff (67%) 
relative to women among our 
faculty (24%).

 

●● The Career Framework to 

identify skills, behaviours and 
values for progression to more 
senior and/or technical roles has 
been drawn up.

●● Two of the four tenured faculty 

appointed were women.

How the gender pay gap is 
calculated

What is the median? 

What is the mean? 

What is equal pay? 

The gender pay gap is the 
difference between the hourly rate 
of pay of male employees and 
female employees (as set out in 
the regulations), expressed as a 
percentage of the hourly pay rate 
of the male employees. The gender 
pay gap is reported on both a 
mean (average) and median (mid-
point on a distribution) basis.

The median shows the middle-
most salary of a sample. It is 
commonly used in analysing both 
internal pay tendency and external 
market norms, because it looks at 
the central tendency of the market 
or sample. It is calculated by listing 
all the salaries in order, from lowest 
to highest, and picking the salary 
at the mid-point.

The mean is the overall average 
of the whole sample. It can be 
skewed by any extremely high or 
low salaries at the top or bottom 
of the sample. It is calculated by 
adding up all the salaries and 
dividing this value by the number 
of salaries.

The gender pay gap is not the 
same as equal pay. UK law has, 
since the 1970s, prohibited paying 
different amounts to men and 
women who are doing ‘like work’, 
‘work of equal value’ or ‘work rated 
as equivalent’ unless there is a 
‘genuine material factor’ for the 
difference.

These complementary metrics 
show different aspects of the 
distribution of pay across an 
organisation.

From April 2017, all organisations that employ more than 250 employees are required to 
report annually on their gender pay gap. For London Business School, this means reporting 
on the pay of all employees – faculty and staff – together.

The gender pay gap is defined as the differences in the average earnings of men and women 
over a standard time period. The above figures have been calculated using the required 
methodology set out in the Equality Act 2010 and represent hourly pay rates.

What is the gender pay gap? See commentary on p20.
