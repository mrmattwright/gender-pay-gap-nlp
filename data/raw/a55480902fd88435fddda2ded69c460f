We are committed to addressing the gender pay gap and in particular enabling and improving the progression of women into more senior roles,  so that there is a more balanced gender profile throughout the organisation.  Below is Just Group plc’s Pay Gap Report for 2017.  You can also download the report as a PDF here .      We want to ensure that Just is a great place to work with a culture built on diversity and inclusion. We’ve started work to address our gender pay gap, but it’s clear that we still have more to do. We are committed to making this change happen and being Just.  Understanding the pay gap regulations  It is important to understand the distinction between the gender pay gap and equal pay. While the gender pay gap is the difference in the average pay of men and women across the organisation, equal pay shows the difference in pay between men and women doing like‑for-like or similar work. It is unlawful to discriminate directly or indirectly in all aspects of employment including recruitment, promotion, opportunities for training, pay and benefits.  What are the typical causes of the gender pay gap in the UK?*   A higher proportion of women choose occupations that offer less financial reward and many high-paying sectors are disproportionately male  A higher proportion of women work part-time, and part-time workers earn less than their full-time counterparts on average  Women are still less likely to progress up the career ladder into senior roles             GENDER PAY & BONUS GAP     Difference between men and women  Mean  Median      Gender Pay gap  45.8%  37.8%    Gender Bonus gap  58.5%  50.0%       Proportion of Employees Receiving a 2016 Bonus       Pay Quartiles Across Uk Employees            Being Just   The data shows that our gender pay gap is not an equal pay for equal roles issue, but is due to the lack of females in senior roles within the organisation  There is no bias in our recruitment or promotion process  As an employee at our company, the percentage of males and females receiving bonuses is very balanced  It is clear that we must consider and address the many other varied causes of the gender gap         We are required to report our figures for the businesses that make up Just Group plc – Just Retirement Management Services Ltd and Partnership Services Ltd  Just Retirement management services Ltd (JRMSL)      GENDER PAY & BONUS GAP     Difference between men and women  Mean  Median      Gender Pay gap  48.4%  36.8%    Gender Bonus gap  67.3%  62.5%       PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVING A 2016 BONUS       PAY QUARTILES ACROSS UK EMPLOYEES (JRMSL)              Partnership SERVICES Ltd (PSL)      GENDER PAY & BONUS GAP     Difference between men and women  Mean  Median      Gender Pay gap  38.6%  38.5%    Gender Bonus gap  45.4%  24.3%       PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVING A 2016 BONUS       PAY QUARTILES ACROSS UK EMPLOYEES (PSL)              Declaration  We confirm that Just Group plc’s pay gap calculations are accurate and meet the requirements of the regulations.
