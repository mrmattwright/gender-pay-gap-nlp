To do this and deliver a new and innovative service to our Clients, we had to select and recruit hand-picked personnel, effectively specialists, their role is far more than the traditional “meet and greet” function – instead they become highly proficient and dynamic team members who have:   Outstanding interpersonal skills   Natural Initiative   A Professional Image   A “can do” approach  These same Concierge Receptionists provide us with not only the “face” at Reception, but also with one of the most vital ingredients – the Elite Team who support the front of house in the event of any form of absence, thereby allowing for the delivery of a seamless Service of the highest quality with demonstrable consistency.
