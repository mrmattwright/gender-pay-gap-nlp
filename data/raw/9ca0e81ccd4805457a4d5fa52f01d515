Gender Pay Gap reporting is not to be confused with Equal Pay; as an organisation Seetec has always been committed to ensuring they do not pay men and women differently for doing the same or equivalent work.   The Gender Pay Gap is as a result of the roles which men and women are employed in and the salaries these roles attract.  Our report illustrates a mean gender pay gap of 18.31% and a median gap of 10.80%.  These figures are representative of an employee base where 41.5% are male and 58.5% are female.   Our figures are in line with the national average and it is clear from the data that our gender imbalance is within the top quartile of our business.
