We are absolutely committed to equality and diversity in the workplace as this reflects the customers and communities we exist to serve. We also passionately believe that embedding equality in everything that we do enables our colleagues to be at their best, to realise their potential and to deliver outstanding service to our customers.  "We are proud to have been voted the 33rd best company (large employer) to work for in the Great Place To Work survey. In addition we’ve been recognised in Stonewall’s Top 100 employers (2017), reflecting the effort we put in to promote diversity. We very much welcome the legislative reporting requirement for organisations to publish details of their gender pay gap on an annual basis and we feel that it supports our ongoing work to promote equality.  "Our results show some progress; our gender pay gap is below the UK national average and we have a greater proportion of females to males in our organisation, unlike many other firms. However, we recognise that there is much more we can and will do. We fully intend to use these results to drive further improvements, helping us to reduce the gender pay gap and to provide continued support and investment to develop all of our colleagues, regardless of which gender they identify as.  "As Chief Executive of Home Group I can confirm that the information contained in this statement is accurate."  Mark Henderson, Home Group CEO  Find out what we're doing about about the gender pay gap .   What is the gender pay gap and how is it calculated?  The gender pay gap looks at the difference in the average pay of men and women. Because different jobs pay differently and the number of males and females performing these jobs varies, a gender pay gap is likely to exist in any organisation.    It is important to understand that there is a fundamental difference between ‘Gender Pay Gap’ and ‘Equal Pay’ - the latter is focused on whether males or females are paid the same for doing the same tpe of work .    A key outcome for the reporting requirements is for organisations to take accountability for looking at their own gap, to understand the reasons behind it and to work out how best to address these. It is also accepted that this is not an issue which can be solved overnight.    All organisations who are required to report (i.e. those employing over 250 employees) are required to calculate the gender pay gap in the same way and use the same terminology. The calculations are based on ‘median’ and ‘mean’ gaps and are reported in pay ‘quartiles’.   Median - The ‘median’ gender pay gap is the difference in pay between female employee in the middle of their line and the male employee in the middle of their line  Mean - The mean gender pay gap is simply the difference in average hourly rate of pay between men and women  Pay quartiles - The salaries for all employees, male and female, are sorted by size and divided into equal quarters. The report shows the percentage of male and female employees in each quarter   Bonus payments are considered in the same way and are calculated independently from base salaries.  The Home Group results were taken as at 5 April 2017.   All colleagues who were identified as being ‘relevant’ were included in the analysis, however contractors were not as the majority were not in scope according the reporting requirements and/or there was insufficient data available.       What are we doing about it?  We pride ourselves on being an inclusive and flexible organisation. The results of the gender pay gap help to demonstrate that there is more we can do to make progress towards an objective to develop an even stronger culture and which includes an active focus on gender equality. The foundation we already have will form the basis of our future plans which will see us build on the following:    The active promotion of inclusive and flexible working practices designed to promote equality and diversity and to enable employees to get the work-life balance right for them.  A strategic career development framework which promotes the growth and development of in-house skills and talent wherever possible.  The ‘Brilliant Recruiter’ training programme which ensures all managers are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively implement our fair and transparent recruitment policy.  A coaching resource dedicated to supporting career development across the organisation.  The commitment to our equality and diversity policy and which will include ongoing analysis of the gender pay gap report to identify potential barriers (with solutions) our colleagues may have in reaching their full potential.  A commitment to explore and develop a new programme designed especially for female employees who want to develop and have the potential to develop into senior executives.  Consult with colleagues on the potential for improving our return to work process with a new buddy/mentor system designed to support the career aspirations of women returning after maternity leave.
