Everyone has the right to expect an exciting, engaging and relevant education, regardless of who they are, or where they live. ” Sir Rod Aldridge OBE, Founder  Lives transformed through entrepreneurial education  Welcome to Aldridge Education. We are a charitable trust whose entrepreneurial community schools help young people to reach their potential. We support our schools’ Principals and teachers in rapidly improving the quality of education on offer at primary, secondary and sixth-form levels in order to transform the life-chances of our students.  Aldridge Education was established as a national multi-academy trust by the Aldridge Foundation in 2016, taking over responsibility from the Foundation for its family of non-selective academy schools and colleges , some of which are part of the MAT whilst others are currently Single Academy Trusts sponsored by Aldridge Education.   Sir Rod Aldridge launched the Aldridge Foundation in 2006 after retiring from Capita Plc, the business he set up and which became one of this country’s most successful companies. Our shared belief is that by introducing young people to, and helping develop in them, the core attributes of entrepreneurship, we can provide context and relevance to their learning, foster creativity, passion, determination, risk taking, problem solving and teamwork. These characteristics help our students achieve in their education and acquire further vital skills for adult life.   OUR GOAL is that, by the age of 25, all Aldridge graduates will have experienced an outstanding and enjoyable education and be able to sustain the life of their choice.  They will be independent, thriving economically and making a real, positive contribution to their communities.
