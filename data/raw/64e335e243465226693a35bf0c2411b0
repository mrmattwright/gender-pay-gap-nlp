GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 
Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017, 
and as an employer with over 250 employees, Wellsway Multi-Academy Trust is 
required to measure and report on the gender pay gap in the organisation.  
This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average 
earnings of men and women in our organisation as set out below. We are required to 
publish the results on our own website and a government website within once calendar 
year of 5 April 2017. 
Under the Regulations we are required to report on the following 6 measures 

1.  The difference in the mean pay of full pay men and women expressed as a 

percentage 

2.  The difference in median pay of full pay men and women expressed as a 

5.  The proportion of men and women who received bonus pay and 
6.  The proportion of full pay men and women in each of four quartile bands 
In relation to the other areas the data is based on 537 staff paid on the data capture 
date of 31 March 2017: 158 male and 379 female. The results for the statutory 
calculations are as follows; 
1.  Mean Gender Pay Gap (hourly rate) 

Male 
Female 

£19.47 
£15.19 

The mean gender pay gap – The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay that 
male and female full –time equivalent employees receive is therefore 22%.  
2.  Median Gender Pay Gap 

Male 
Female 

£19.57 
£12.81 

The median gender pay gap - The difference between the median hourly rate of pay 
that male and female full –time equivalent employees receive is therefore is  35%. 
The Trust has not paid any bonus payments over the period 1 April 2016 
to 31 March 2017 and therefore there is no requirement to report on 
measure 3, 4 and 5 above.

Supporting Statement and Narrative 
Wellsway Multi Academy Trust, at the data capture date of 31 March 2017, 
comprised of: 

-  2 secondary academies 
-  2 studio schools 

-  1 special school  
-  2 primary schools and 

-  Central trust offices 

Wellsway Multi Academy Trust operates as an equal opportunities employer, and 
takes appropriate steps to ensure that it does not discriminate in any way (as 
defined by the Equalities Act 2010 and other relevant legislation), regarding 
recruitment, performance management and employee career development 
opportunities. 
The Trust recruits to oppose gender specific roles and has employees in roles that 
nationally are considered gender biased, for example the Chief Executive Officer is 
female. 

 

 

The majority of support staff roles in the trust are part – time, either aligning closely 
with the hours of attendance of pupils or for part of that time. This not only includes 
the number of hours per week but also the number of weeks worked each year. 
Whilst this will impact on the average salaries, it is also a factor that influences the 
decision of applicants and the continuation of employment with the Trust from staff.  
78% of the Trust’s support roles are filled by female staff. 
It is common in the Education sector for a high proportion of the workforce to be 
female. The Trust has a 29.4% male workforce and 70.6% female. Over 90% of staff 
within the Trust have joined via TUPE processes.  
The overall published UK gender pay gap is 18.1%. 
The Trust will monitor this data on an ongoing basis as growth and change within the 
Trust may alter the data by the next reporting date. It is recognised that under TUPE 
processes the Trust has no control over the staffing complement where Academies 
join the Trust.  
The Trust is also looking to implement leadership development programmes for 
those aspiring to middle and senior leadership and career development / 
progression utilising the apprenticeship levy, to support and enable equal access 
to all staff. 
This initial report and its data provides a baseline for the Trust to compare to in future 
years to identify any trends and consider progress made on reducing the gender pay 
gap.
