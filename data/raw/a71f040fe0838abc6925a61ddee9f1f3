As demonstrated in our published report, Radius has carried out the six statutory calculations which I can confirm are based on accurate data.  At 30.0%, our mean gender pay gap is currently smaller than the indicative average for the financial services industry in which we operate (34%) but greater than the indicative average for the UK as a whole (17%). The results of the quartile pay band calculations indicate that the pay gap is primarily an issue in the top quartile of employees which includes the board of directors and a number of significant shareholders. The proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees across the first three quartile pay bands are very well balanced with more women employed in quartiles 2 and 3.  We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. Our main challenge therefore in closing the mean gender pay gap will involve increasing the number of female employees in very senior positions in the Group. We are committed to achieving this and will continue to support a number of initiatives designed to afford all staff an equal chance to progress in the business. These include our flexible working request process, child care vouchers, mixed gender recruitment panels and a transparent application process for our Graduate Management Programme and internal Leadership Development Programme.

Comparing these results will indicate the distribution of full-pay relevant male and female employees in the quartile. Comparing results between the quartiles will indicate the distribution of full-pay relevant male and female employees across the organisation Quartile 1 Total employees 245 Findings: Of the 245 employees in the lower quartile, 119 are male and 126 are female. This means 48.6% are male and 51.4% are female. Quartile 2 Total employees 245 Findings: Of the 245 employees in the lower middle quartile, 115 are male and 130 are female. This means 46.9% are male and 53.1% are female. Quartile 3 Total employees 245 Findings: Of the 245 employees in the upper middle quartile, 126 are male and 119 are female. This means 51.4% are male and 48.6% are female. Quartile 4 Total employees 245 Findings: Of the 245 employees in the upper quartile, 179 are male and 66 are female. This means 73.1% are male and 26.9% are female.
