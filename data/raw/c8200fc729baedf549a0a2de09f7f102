"We  are  very  proud  of  our  incredibly  talented  people  and  the 
impact they have on our business.  At Explore, we are committed to 
providing  our  employees  with  the  same  opportunities  for 
development and progression irrespective of their gender. 
 
I  am  proud  to  publish  our  ﬁrst  gender  pay  gap  report  and  I  can 
conﬁrm  that  the  data  in  this  report  is  accurate  in  meeting 
Government regulations.  I am delighted that our median gender 
pay  gap  is  0%  and  that  this  is  substantially  lower  than  the  UK 
average which stands at 18.4%. I feel that this is a real reﬂection of 
our family culture at Explore where we aim to create a welcoming 
place  for  employees  and  children  of  all  backgrounds.    We 
acknowledge our mean gap of 4.6% which, as stated, reﬂects the 
composition of our current Senior Leadership Team.
 
We place great value on shaping our business based on feedback 
from our employees. Back in early 2017, we introduced our ﬁrst pay 
spines  to  promote  transparency  of  pay.  This  mechanism  ensures 
than men and women are paid equally for the jobs they complete 
removing any opportunities for bias. Our annual pay reviews across 
the  business  based  upon  these  spines    reward  our  employees 
according  to  performance  and  length  of  service  regardless  of 
gender. 

 
The  company  has  an  ethos  of  promoting  from  within 
which means our core vision and values are embedded 
at every level. I began my journey with Explore as a tutor 
back  in  2002  and  have  directly  beneﬁted  from  the 
fantastic culture of nurturing homegrown talent. I count 
myself  lucky  to  work  for  such  a  forward-thinking 
business  that  champions  internal  development  where 
promotion is irrelevant of gender. 
 
 
Our  journey  doesn't  stop  here!  Our  gender  pay  gap  of 
0% gives us a social responsibility to lead the way as an 
organisation  championing  equality  in  pay.  We  will 
continue  to  work  on    promoting  diversity  within  our 
talent pool to ensure our workforce reﬂects the diversity 
of  the  customers  we  serve.    We  remain  committed  to 
improving  our  ﬂexibility  and  providing  opportunities 
throughout  the  organisation  for  those  returning  from 
family leave. "
