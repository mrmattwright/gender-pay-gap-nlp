Gender Pay Gap legislation requires all employers of 250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap as at 31st March. The attached data is based on a snapshot date of 31st March 2017. The information is sourced from the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) system, which holds our employee data. The information has also been submitted to the Governments Gender Pay Gap reporting portal.  Gender Pay Gap Report  Creating Positive Cultures and supporting individual aspirations - During the development and analysis of our gender pay gap data, we spoke with a number of senior females in our organisation who have shared their experiences of being a female in the NHS - click here for more information .  Dean Royles, Director of Human Resources and Organisational Development, has written this article regarding Gender Pay Gap reporting in the NHS.
