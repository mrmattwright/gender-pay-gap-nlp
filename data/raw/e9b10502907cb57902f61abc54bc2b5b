wholeheartedly to reduce our gender pay gap.

women than for men.

The average bonus paid was

STEPS WE ARE TAKING TO REDUCE OUR GENDER PAY GAP

We are committed to reducing our gender pay gap with these proposed actions:

Reviewing our succession planning and 
our female talent pipeline

Introducing mandatory “unconscious 
bias” training

Ensuring our interviewer panels for  
senior positions include  
female members

Ensuring all shortlists for senior 
 positions include female contenders 
wherever possible

Revisiting our recruitment process to 
try to attract more female  candidates 
for senior roles, with specific 
 recommendations put in place

Revisiting our internal career 
 development process to encourage 
more female candidates within senior 
positions – such as enabling more 
part-time or flexible working

I confirm that the data given above are accurate and that the calculations have been carried out in accordance 
with the  regulations given.
