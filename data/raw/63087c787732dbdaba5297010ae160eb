Holdsworth Gender Pay Gap Report

Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish
statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and
female employees.

Our declared figures are as follows:

•             Women’s hourly rate is 2.9% lower (mean) and 4.7% lower (median)
•             Top salary quartile has 84% men and 16% women
•             Upper middle salary quartile has 87.2% men and 12.8% women
•             Lower middle salary quartile has 90.4% men and 9.6% women
•             Lower salary quartile has 73.4% men and 26.6% women
•             Women’s bonus pay is 47.5% lower (mean) and 68.6% lower (median)*
•             87.3% of men and 66.2% of women received bonus pay

*The gender gap in bonus payments is largely due to the fact that the roles in which performance
bonuses are used are manual, male dominated (HGV Driving/Warehouse order picking) roles.

Holdsworth is a diverse organisation which requires a range of different skills from its employees. 
We are committed to reducing the gender pay gap between men and women but the operational
nature of the business means that unless there is an equal number of men and women available
in the UK workforce for these roles there will inevitably be some overall inbalance in our results.

We are pleased to report that our gender pay gap is significantly lower than the national average.
The 2.9% difference is explained by the fact that senior, higher paid roles in the company have
a higher number of men than women.

I confirm that the pay gap data reported is accurate and has been collated in accordance with
the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
