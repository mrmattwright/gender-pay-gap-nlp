UNDERSTANDING THE GENDER PAY GAP

WHAT DOES THE GENDER PAY GAP MEASURE? 
The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in average pay of men and women, regardless of the nature of their work.
This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings, e.g. women earn x% less than men. A negative percentage indicates that 
women earn more than men.
The gender pay gap does not measure equal pay, which relates to the amount that men and women are paid for the same or 
similar jobs.

HOW ARE THE MEDIAN AND MEAN PAY AND BONUS GAPS CALCULATED?
The mean pay gap is a comparison of the average pay for a woman and the average pay for a man.
The median pay gap is a comparison of the hourly rate of pay for the woman in the middle of the line if all our female employees 
stood next to each other in order of lowest hourly rate of pay to highest, and the hourly rate of pay for the man in the middle of 
the line if all our male employees did the same. 
Mean and median calculations are also carried out when comparing bonus pay over a twelve month period. The proportion of 
men and women awarded any bonus pay over that period is reported.

HOW ARE THE PAY QUARTILES CALCULATED?
We also report the percentage of men and women in each pay quartile. Quartiles are calculated by listing the rates of pay for 
each employee across the business from lowest to highest, before allocating that list into four equal sized groups of men and 
women and calculating the percentage of men and women in each of these groups.
The median and mean pay gap and quartile pay bandings are based on data from April 2017 only.
The bonus gap calculations required by the UK regulations are based on the bonus payments made in the 12 months to 5 April 
2017 and are not full time equivalent adjusted. 

OUR EMPLOYEES

Our employees are integral to achieving our business objectives and the Company actively takes steps to attract, inspire and 
retain the right people to work at every level throughout NEXT. For example, our architect designed and purpose built, state of 
the art Head Office child care nursery called ‘NEXT Steps’ is part of our on-going commitment to supporting our employees with 
their pre-school childcare arrangements.
NEXT endeavours to ensure that salary differentials between individuals in the business are fair and justifiable. Most roles within 
the business have an associated salary grid with differentials within the same role being determined by competency, regardless 
of gender. Differences in salary between individuals in the same role must be justified by levels of performance in that role.

PAY GAP & PAY QUARTILES – NEXT RETAIL LIMITED

DETAILS BEHIND THE GENDER PAY NUMBERS AT NEXT RETAIL LIMITED
We have found no inconsistencies with the pay for men and women doing equivalent jobs across our business and we are 
confident that the men and women who work for us are being paid equally for equivalent jobs.
The details behind our gender pay numbers:
•  Over 70% of our employees are women, with over 85% of these women working in our stores which is consistent with the 

demographics in the Retail sector. Looking just at this group of employees, the mean gender pay gap was 1.8%

•  As with many retail organisations, when we look across the NEXT workforce our gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the 

fact that such a high percentage of our colleagues in stores are women and therefore overall we have a significantly larger 
proportion of women than men in our lower paid roles

•  If we calculate the mean hourly pay gap within each quartile detailed in the table below (to get closer to a like for like 

comparison of roles), this also shows a much narrower pay gap than the overall pay gap. In fact within the lower quartile, 
women earn on average 1.0% more than males

•  27% of male employees compared to 14% of female employees work in our head office. Head office pay rates are typically 

higher than our stores due to the more technical nature of the roles. The majority of our head office employees fall within the 
upper quartile in the table below

•  We have good female representation in our most senior roles and on our Board. Women currently make up 50% of our 

executive directors, 44% of our total Board, and 47% of our senior leadership team. NEXT was ranked first in the 2017 
Hampton-Alexander Review ‘FTSE100 for Women on Boards and in Leadership’

PROPORTION OF MEN AND WOMEN EMPLOYEES WHO RECEIVED BONUS PAY
All employees are eligible to participate in bonus arrangements and we operate several bonus schemes which are designed to be 
relevant for the specific area of the business to which they relate.

We are confident that males and females have an equal opportunity to participate in and earn a bonus.

DETAILS BEHIND THE BONUS PAY GAP NUMBERS AT NEXT RETAIL LIMITED
Our bonus pay gap is strongly influenced by the balance of men and women across job roles. We have a significantly larger 
proportion of women than men who work in our stores, therefore we have a larger proportion of women than men in our lower 
paid roles and some bonus structures are closely linked to seniority.
Other factors behind our gender bonus numbers:
•  We have a much higher proportion of women working part-time versus men and therefore receiving pro-rated bonuses and 

longer-term incentive awards. We estimate that around 74% of our workforce worked an average of 30 hours or less each 
week

•  The regulations require the gender bonus gap to be calculated using actual bonus payments made in the 12 months to 5 April 
2017 and are not therefore full time equivalent adjusted. We have estimated that restatement of our gender bonus gap based 
on bonus pay per hour worked, would reduce our mean gender bonus gap to around 28% (shown in the table below*)
