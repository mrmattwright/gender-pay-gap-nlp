Central to this is being an inclusive organisation. Our Gender Pay Gap Report is the result of an important piece of legislation which requires all companies with more than 250 employees in the UK to publish their gender pay gap figures on the Government website and also on the their own website every year. The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average pay and bonus for men and women across all roles and levels within a business.
