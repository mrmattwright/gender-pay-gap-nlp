Gender Pay Gap – Statistics 

As an employer for more than 250 staff, Young Epilepsy has undertaken Gender Pay 

Gap reporting as required by the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 

Regulations 2017.  For all organisations, other than the public sector, the date to be 

used for data collection was set as 5 April 2017. 

The gender pay gap in an organisation is the difference in pay levels between male 

and female employees.  Young Epilepsy’s pay approach supports the fair treatment 

and reward of all staff irrespective of gender. 

Our workforce is predominantly female, with women making up 74% of our staff. 

We are confident that men and women are paid fairly and equally for the same or 

similar roles. 

 

Young Epilepsy Gender Pay Gap 

 

We are pleased to report that Young Epilepsy has a negative median pay gap of -

4.3% and a small mean pay gap of 5.9%.  This means that median hourly pay for 

women employed by Young Epilepsy is on average higher than for men while mean 

hourly pay is higher for men than women. These figures are considerably below the 

national average of an 18% pay gap.

Next Steps 

Young Epilepsy are committed to fair pay irrespective of gender and will continue to 

build on actions and initiatives including:

with Line Managers and development opportunities 

  Supporting women to move from operational management to senior
