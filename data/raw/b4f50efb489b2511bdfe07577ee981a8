This ethos is reflected in our College Values. All students and staff benefit from an inclusive college community which appreciates and celebrates our different backgrounds and cultures.  Aims  The College aims to:  Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act 2010 Advance equality of opportunity between people of different groups Foster good relations between people from different groups The above aims are in accordance with those outlined in the general duty of the Act.  College Strategy  The college has clearly established structures, policies and procedures and monitoring arrangements in place with regard to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI). An Action Plan is in place and monitored regularly by the EDI Coordinator and the EDI steering Group.  The college was awarded Leaders in Diversity accreditation in August 2016 by the National Centre for Diversity. As part of this the college's senior management and governors have worked together to ensure that EDI is embedded in their practices. The EDI Coordinator was also awarded FE Sector EDI Lead of the Year for her work with the College in ensuring EDI is full embedded by students and staff.  As part of the Leaders in Diversity Action Plan, The EDI Coordinator has worked with the Procurement Team to ensure that all our suppliers and contractors understand what is expected from them with regard to EDI in their workplaces.  Every supplier has been required to either have their own EDI policy or use ours.  In addition we have stated in our paperwork that we will not knowingly do business with  any company that uses Modern Day Slavery or trafficking in its supply chain.  Our College values are:  Integrity We speak and act truthfully, admit our mistakes & honour our commitment Respect We value learners and colleagues as individuals, celebrating and accommodating both differences and similarities and encouraging diversity, originality and innovation Fairness We treat students and colleagues fairly, provide opportunities for individual success, apply rules with equity and expect the same in return Openness We share information, ideas and feelings; listen carefully, speak forthrightly, respect diverse views and participate productively in dialogue Enjoyment We take our learning and work seriously and ourselves lightly High Expectations We have high expectations of ourselves, our learners, our colleagues and our partners and support each other to meet them Take a look at a film produced by our PGCE students and staff to celebrate equality and diversity:    Click on the link to see the Festival of Cultures film which was organised by our ESOL students...
