The purpose of sharing this information is to highlight the difference between the average pay of men and women, and to encourage companies to put plans in place to get rid of any gaps that they have.  Gender pay reporting measures the difference in the average pay of men and women (regardless of the role they do) across the whole company. It is different to Equal Pay, which is about men and women being paid the same when they do the same job.  Our report was compiled from a snapshot of our data from 5th April 2017 , when we had 584 team members.      Please click here to read the report.
