Gender Pay Report 2017

Elior UK Gender Pay Report 2017Introduction

From April 2017, companies with more than 250 colleagues are legally required to calculate their Gender Pay Gap 
Statistics. Elior UK and our specialist brands Lexington, Caterplus, Taylor Shaw and Edwards & Blake welcome this 
within our business, the increased transparency will help to influence positive change, not just within the Company, 
but nationally. We are committed to accelerating the rate of change and taking further action to develop and support 
our diverse and inclusive workforce. An activity which supports and underpins the Elior Group’s corporate social 
responsibility strategy and commitments on gender equality and the stand against discrimination.

This is an activity that I am personally committed to; celebrating and rewarding the vital contribution and success of our 
female colleagues. I want to help women within the Company achieve their full potential and, by doing this, I believe 
that not only will the individual benefit but so will the wider business.  

The Leadership Team knows that all aspects of diversity and inclusion are central to the success of our business; we have 
developed an inclusive and supportive culture. We are committed to continuing to drive change and look forward to a 
future where there is equality for all. By creating a strategic focus, delivering tangible actions and working alongside our 
colleagues, I am sure the whole business will embrace this challenge and together we can close the gap.

I confirm that 
all data in this 
report is accurate 
and has been 
calculated in 
accordance with 
the regulations.

Elior UK Gender Pay Report 2017Understanding Our Gap
What is our Gender Pay Gap?
We have calculated that our gender pay gap is 18.7%, which is slightly above the national figure of 18.4% reported by 
the ONS(1). 

Reasons for the Pay Gap
Our workforce is predominantly female (68.7%) and the main reason behind our gap is because these colleagues are 
not evenly distributed across all four quartiles. Essentially, there is a higher concentration of women working in the 
lower quartiles, where a lot of the roles typically offer a greater degree of flexibility, such as working part time, term 
time or both. 

As we move to the top two quartiles, the proportion of female colleagues decreases, as does the number of part time and 
term time roles. This correlation is significant because it is well established that one of the main barriers for women in 
the workplace is childcare commitments. 

Many of our female colleagues are working within the education and care sectors. These roles provide more flexible part 
time/term time working hours that can be very convenient for many families with young children. However, as many of 
these roles are in the lower quartiles, this has contributed significantly to our Gender Pay Gap.

Reasons for the Bonus Gap
In order to ensure we are rewarding all colleagues fairly for their achievements, bonuses are paid on a percentage of 
salary basis. As we have a lot more women than men working part time hours, this is also contributing to a bonus gap. 
By encouraging our female colleagues to develop their careers with us, we will also be working to close our bonus pay 
gap; it is the roles within those top two quartiles that tend to be eligible bonus payments.

How will we address the Gender Pay Gap?
The challenge for us is to even out the distribution of our female colleagues and encourage them to progress into the top 
two quartiles. To influence this change, we firstly have to understand the reasons behind our statistics and will address 
this further in our commitments to close the gap.

Our Commitments

It is important to us that we support all our colleagues to reach their full potential and we have made the following 
commitments which will address closing the gap:

1.  Continue to reinforce our internal initiative, Celebrate Equality, which promotes awareness of equality, diversity 

and inclusion within our workplace and recruitment practices.

We have always promoted a culture of equality and inclusion within our business and we will continue to do this in 
all areas.

2.  Commitment to increase the percentage of female delegates attending our learning and development programmes.

In our most recent reporting cycle, 63% of colleagues attending our training courses were female. We want to move 
this towards 69%, which is aligned with the proportion of female colleagues in our business.

Elior UK Gender Pay Report 20173.  We have made the commitment to increase the number of women attending our Chef Academies, to help breakdown 

some of the stereotypes associated with the role of a chef.

This programme is designed to develop colleagues working in our kitchens, who aspire to become chefs. They are 
taught a wide range of skills to help kick-start their career progression. 

4.  Explore the causes of the Gender Pay Gap by engaging with colleague representatives to identify future focus 

areas for career progression.

The only way we can fully close the gap is by understanding all the reasons behind it. While we can speculatively 
identify many of the causes ourselves, it’s important that we listen to ensure we focus our attention in the right 
areas.

5.  Ensure that our Gender Pay Gap and our commitments are shared across the business at all levels to create 

awareness, challenge attitudes and drive change.

This level of change is not something that can be done by a few; we want all our colleagues working together to 
close the gap.

Elior UK Gender Pay Report 2017Our People

We provide many opportunities for colleagues to progress their careers with us in an environment which supports 
flexibility and professional development.

Here are two examples of female colleagues who have taken up some of these opportunities.

Kal Abate – Chef de Partie, Elior at Schroders and winner of LexChef 
Culinary Competition 2017
Kal has been working with Elior for 2 years and has gone from strength to strength 
during this time, most recently winning our prestigious LexChef competition in 
2017. 

LexChef is a culinary competition open to all chefs across the Elior UK London 
business  and  is  a  great  opportunity  for  colleagues  to  showcase  their  talents. 
Kal competed against some of the most experienced and well-renowned Chefs 
within the business, taking victory with her Ethiopian-inspired menu. She is one 
of our many talented and ambitious female chefs, thriving in a traditionally male-
dominated working environment.  

What do you enjoy most about working for Elior?
“In catering environments, a Monday to Friday role can be hard to come by so the work life balance, the location and 
working in a small, friendly team is really great. Although there are challenges every day as a chef, there is never a dull 
moment and this is what I enjoy, along with the prospect of career progression within the Company.”

How confident did you feel in your ability to win LexChef?
“I entered LexChef because I wanted to prove a point to me and to others. I think I don’t always have a lot of self-
confidence but this has proved to me and my colleagues that I have confidence and that I can achieve a lot, work hard 
and keep going.”

How has the competition furthered your development?
“It was hard, really hard, but it shouldn’t be easy and there was tough competition. It made me think outside the box 
and realise my own potential. I am now confident that I can achieve and I can oversee projects. The next step for me 
would be to become a Sous Chef, but I really aspire to become a Head Chef eventually. 

I would like to keep learning and Elior will support me to develop the skills I need. They are supportive of what I have 
done so far, and I want to use their help to progress.”

Elior UK Gender Pay Report 2017Trisha Hewitt – Operations Manager for Taylor Shaw
With years of experience within the Education catering sector, Trisha originally started 
back of house and has since progressed into an operational role, changing hours and 
responsibilities to fit around her family and to ensure the correct work / life balance.  

How did you manage to find the right work / life balance?
“Working part time (16 hours a week) and term time meant that I could drop off and pick 
up my children when they were smaller. This was something that was really important to 
me as a Mum but also meant that I didn’t have to worry about additional childcare costs. 
The term time weeks allowed me to spend all the school holidays with them, rather than juggling my holidays and kids 
clubs as so many parents do. As they got older and more independent they were able to walk themselves to and from 
school and I was provided with the flexibility to increase my hours to 24 hours per week.  I was still working term time, 
so I still had all school holidays to enjoy being a Mum.”

How did your career progress?
“I was offered the opportunity to move into a full time, Catering Manager role when my kids were more independent. 
As my kids no longer needed the same level of support and structure from me, I felt the time was right to concentrate 
on my career. 

I kept to term time for a while as I enjoyed spending the holidays with my children but when an opportunity arose to 
take on an Operations Manager role the timing was right for me and my family. It is a busy role that has me travelling a 
lot and while I really enjoy the challenge and variety, I appreciate that I had the time with my children when I needed it.”
