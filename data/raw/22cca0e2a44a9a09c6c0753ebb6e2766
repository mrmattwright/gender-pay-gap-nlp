Understanding gender pay gap reporting 

What is the di(cid:31)erence between equal pay and a 
gender pay gap?

A gender pay gap is di(cid:30)erent from equal pay.

Equal pay

Equal pay is paying males and females equally for like work,
work of equal value and work rated as equivalent. There has
been legislation outlining equal pay obligations in the UK for
nearly 50 years.

Gender pay gap

A gender pay gap looks at the di(cid:30)erences in pay between
genders across groups of employees irrespective of the work
they perform.

One of the main reasons for the gender pay gap in our society is

that men are statistically more likely to be in senior roles.

Understanding gender pay gap reporting 

How are the median and mean 
gaps calculated?

The median is the middle point of a range 
of numbers and the mean is the average of 
a range of numbers. How do we calculate 
this for gender pay gap reporting?

Median  pay  gap  – 
If  all  our  male 
colleagues  stood  in  a  line  in  order  of 
lowest  hourly  rate  earned  to  highest  and 
females did the same, the median pay gap 
(as a percentage) is the di(cid:30)erence in pay 
between the middle colleague on the male 
line  and  the  middle  colleague  on  the 
female line. 

Median pay gap

Mean pay gap – If we add together all the 
hourly  rates  of  male  colleagues  and 
calculate the  average  and  do  the same 
for  female  colleagues,  the  mean  pay  gap 
(as a percentage) is the di(cid:30)erence in pay 
between  the  average  male  and  female 
hourly rate.

Mean pay gap

Sum of the male rates 

How is the bonus gap
calculated?

The  mean  and  median  bonus  gap  are 
calculated in the same way as the gender 
pay  gaps.  However,  this  time  we  use  the 
actual  bonus  paid  to  the  colleagues.  We 
also report the number of male and female 
colleagues 
a 
percentage  of  the  total  male  and  female 
population).

How are the pay quartiles 
calculated?

Pay quartiles are calculated by dividing all 
hourly rates paid across the business, from 
lowest  to  highest,  into  four  equal  sized 
groups  of  colleagues  and  calculating  the 
percentage of males and females in each.

Reasons behind our gender pay gap

WBASL  is  comprised  of  corporate  functions  supporting 
the Pharmaceutical Wholesale Division and International 
Retail  business  of  Walgreens  Boots  Alliance, 
Inc. 
(NASDAQ:  WBA).  We  have  approximately  350 
employees. Our senior population is predominantly male 
and, therefore, the overall gender pay gap appears large, 
as it compares the lowest paid employees alongside the 
highest. When comparing like for like roles, we can see 
that the gender pay gap, when looking at each quartile, 
particularly the ﬁrst three (lower quartile, second quartile 
and third quartile) is far smaller. 

We  have  relatively  low  attrition  at  senior  levels,  with 
average length of service being approximately 10 years. 
This has provided us with limited opportunities for new 
appointments,  regardless  of  gender  at  a  senior  level. 
While  we  have  certainly  promoted  female  employees 
into senior roles, we have a higher percentage of male 
applicants,  both  internally  and  externally.  Within  the 
external market for Pharmaceutical Wholesale, we have 
found that many senior positions are occupied by males, 
who  comprise  the  talent  pool  from  which  we  are 
recruiting.
