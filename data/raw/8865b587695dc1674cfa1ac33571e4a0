UK Power Networks Gender Pay Report

What is Gender Pay Reporting? 
The UK Government has introduced new legislation (Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017) which means that from April 
2018, some of the UK Power Networks legal entities are required to report on their Gender Pay Gap. This will need to be calculated and published on an 
annual basis.  

It is important to explain that this is not the same as Equal Pay as the statistics are not comparing males and females who are doing equal work but 
rather looks more broadly at all males and females at all levels within in the organisation and their distribution. 

What does UK Power Networks overall Gender Pay look like? 
This report details the overall Gender Pay positon for all of the UK Power Networks employing entities - namely [UK PN (Operations) Ltd, UK PN (South 
East Services), UKPN (Transport Ltd), UKPNS (Commercial) Ltd, and UKPNS (Contracting) Ltd].  These have been calculated in line with the mechanisms 
which are set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation.

Why does our Gender Pay Gap look like this? 
UK Power Networks' overall Mean Gender Pay Gap is 17.28%. While this is lower than the UK’s national gender pay gap of 18.1%, the Company would 
like to see this reduced over a period of time. UK Power Networks operates in the electricity sector,which by the very nature of the type of work 
undertaken, has historically attracted a high percentage of male recruits. 

Only 18% of the workforce is made up of females. The analysis shows that there are significantly fewer women in the professional, engineering and 
senior management levels of the organisation. It is also widely acknowledged that there is a shortage of female students progressing into STEM 
subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Manufacturing) through the formal education system, both schools and universities/colleges.

How we are closing the Gap 
UK Power Networks offers a number of career development opportunities for technical/operational roles. This includes Foundation Apprenticeships for school leavers 
and apprentice opportunities for more experienced staff, an Engineering Development Programme and Graduate Programme. UK Power Networks also offers a 
number of Leadership training programmes – Future Leaders, Aspiring Leaders and New Leader courses. 

UK Power Networks acknowledge that more needs to be done to encourage women to join the organisation. Work is being done through both School and University 
engagement which include career events, 1 to 1 presentations, employer workshops and career advice. There has been an active focus for UK Power Networks to 
promote and recruit more females into these training programmes. This is having a positive effect which can be demonstrated by the 2017 Graduate intake, with 
the proportion of female graduates appointed from 2016 increasing by 21%. 

UK Power Networks is also doing more to increase employees’ awareness of the Company’s diversity ambitions, ‘Everyone Matters’. UK Power Networks are 
currently looking to achieve the National Equality Standard Accreditation. An initial assessment has been undertaken by the registered assessors operating on behalf 
of National Equality Standard and an action plan has been developed with a view to obtaining formal accreditation during 2018. Those involved in taking recruitment 
and promotion decisions are being provided with specific, additional training and support to reduce the chances of any potential unconscious (gender) bias and 
ensure that decisions are based purely on the 'best candidate for the job'.
