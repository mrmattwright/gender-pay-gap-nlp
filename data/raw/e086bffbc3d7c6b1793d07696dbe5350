Gender Pay Gap Report: Snap Shot 2017

1.

Introduction

Since the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011 (SDR) came into 
force on 10 September 2011, there has been a duty for public bodies with 150 or 
more employees to publish information on the diversity of their workforce. Although 
the SDR did not require mandatory Gender Pay Gap (GPG) reporting, the 
Government Equalities Office (GEO) and the Equality and Human Rights 
Commission (EHRC) provided guidance that made it clear that employers should 
consider including GPG information in the data they already publish. It was evident 
that not all employers did this, so the government made GPG reporting mandatory 
by amending the SDR so that all public sector employers with more than 250 
employees have to measure and publish their gender pay gaps from 2017-18 
onward.

For the first year, the data will be a snapshot of the pay period including 31 March 
20171, which needs to be uploaded to the Government website and published on the 
Trust website by 31 March 2018. The results must remain on the organisation's 
website for three years. Subsequent Gender Pay Gap reports will be amalgamated 
into the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) reports from 2018 onwards.

The legal requirement for employers is to:

 Calculate the hourly rate of ordinary pay relating to the pay period in which the 

snapshot day falls.

 Calculate the difference between the mean hourly rate of ordinary pay of male 
and female employees, and the difference between the median hourly rate of 
ordinary pay of male and female employees.

 Calculate the difference between the mean (and median) bonus pay paid to 

male and female employees.

 Calculate the proportions of male and female employees who were paid a 

bonus.

 Calculate the proportions of male and female employees in the lower, lower 
middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands by number of employees 
rather than rate of pay.

Further guidance around the Gender Pay Report can be found on the NHS 
Employers website below, which has links to advice from Capsticks and ACAS which 
we have referred to in compiling this report:

The majority of salaries at HRCH are determined through a job evaluation scheme 
called Agenda for Change (AFC); this accounts for 97.9% of the workforce. Job 
evaluation measures the job and not the post holder. It makes no reference to 
gender of existing or potential job holders.

1 The relevant pay period means the pay period within which the snapshot date falls, which for monthly-paid 
staff would be the month in which the date is included.

Pay is predominately based on salary and/or service prior to or upon joining the 
Trust. Pay on promotion and progression in pay scale is based on the relevant 
national terms and conditions of service. 

The data is derived from the specifically designed report in the Business Intelligence 
(BI) reporting element of the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) and records the following 
number of staff in each group.

The table above splits the overall Trust figure into Agenda for Change and Medical/ 
Other pay bands/ scales. The table shows that for staff on Agenda for Change pay 
scales, female workers have for each pay band a higher average hourly pay rate 
than male counterparts.

The Medical/ Other category includes doctors of all grades, VSM staff and NEDs. 
This category is the only one that shows on average males being paid a higher 
hourly rate  than females. It should be noted that this data is based on 6 male staff 

3 VSM pay rates apply to staff governed by NHS Improvement’s ‘Guidance on Pay for very senior managers in 
NHS trusts and foundation trusts’. 

4 Non-Executive Director (NED) remuneration scales are set nationally

Page 3 of 5

and 19 females. , The combination of a few male staff in the category, prescribed 
salary scales for particular VSM Director roles with relative high hourly rates and 
differences in years of service led to a higher average than their female counterparts. 

The 19 females in the Medical/ Other category contained more consultant medical 
staff but the majority of these staff have fewer years’ service as a consultant and the 
consultant’s pay scale increments are based on years’ service in accordance with 
medical and dental terms and conditions. It should be noted that two female workers 
in this group had the highest hourly rate in the Trust.

The 6 males in higher hourly rate roles also have a significant influence on the 
overall Trust mean hourly rate (Table 2) constituting 3.82% of the male workforce; 
whereas 19 females only constitute 1.81% of the total female workforce.

As with the mean table the median table shows that for staff on Agenda for Change 
pay scales the female median is higher than the male median except for the Medical/ 
Other category has a higher median for males than females. The reason for this is 
the same as for the mean.

Table 5 was produced by listing the hourly rates in order and splitting the table into 
quartiles by number of employees Quartile 1 includes those staff with the lowest 
hourly rate while Quartile 4 includes those staff with the highest hourly rates.

Bonus Payments

In the current reporting year one bonus payment (Clinical Excellence Award) was 
paid as part of Medical and Dental remuneration package to a male doctor. The 
Clinical Excellence Award is an historical award which predates the current 
organisation.  

This means that 0.64% of males received a bonus and 0% of females. There is no 
difference between the mean or median bonus paid to males and females as the 
bonus relates to only one member of staff.

Conclusion

The Trust employs a predominantly female workforce and follows national pay 
guidance across all grades of staff regardless of gender. Across all Agenda for 
Change pay scales, females are paid more than their male counterparts on average. 
In the category Medical/Other males are paid more than females. This difference is 
influenced by the salary scales for particular VSM Director roles and years of service 
for Medical staff rather than gender difference.

Actions 

 The Gender Pay Gap report has been shared with the Trust’s Executive 

Committee, Trust Board, Trust Equality and Diversity Committee and 
recognised trade unions via our Joint Negotiating and Consultative Committee 
(JNCC)

 The information generated by the Gender Pay Gap review will be monitored 
closely by the Trust Equality and Diversity Committee to ensure that there is 
no evidence of gender discrimination developing

 The Trust will publish gender pay gap information annually and monitor its 

situation internally and in relation to other NHS Trust benchmarks.
