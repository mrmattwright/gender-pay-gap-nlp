This involves carrying out calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation.  The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay. Equal pay at Encirc ensures that men and women receive the same pay for carrying out the same jobs. The gender pay gap is an average figure for all employees at Encirc, regardless of seniority.  The container glass manufacturing industry has traditionally been one that has been very much male-dominated. This is no different at Encirc, and while we are addressing this, our gender balance remains uneven and that is reflected in the below gender pay gap information.  The gender pay gap is an area that will take time to resolve across our industry. Encirc is being proactive at addressing its gap and has launched a number of initiatives to eliminate the gender pay gap in the long term. Part of the way to achieve this is to recruit more women into our workplace, and it is extremely positive that almost 19% of our workforce are female. This is significantly higher than the average in our industry. During the last 18 months we have introduced a fairer and more robust recruitment system, and recently launched a working group to address all aspects of Diversity within the workplace.  We are also firmly focused on becoming an employer of choice by providing our employees with a workplace that prioritises wellbeing and inclusion, and this was recognised in 2017 when our Northern Ireland business became “Core accredited” by Business in the Community.  We will continue to leave no stone unturned in creating a diverse business that is a great place to work for all.
