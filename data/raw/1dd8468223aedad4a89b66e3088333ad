Ahead of the April 2018 deadline set by the government, Secure Trust Bank has published its gender pay gap statistics.  Our people are our most important asset and it is vital that we reward them properly and appropriately for their service to the Bank. Having a fair and equitable approach to pay is central to how we do business at Secure Trust Bank and there is no disparity in pay within specific roles – all employees doing a particular job are paid equally, regardless of gender.  There is, however, a difference between the average and median pay of men and women within the organisation when you look at it as a whole. This is predominantly due to the higher number of men in senior roles at the Bank.  This position is common within our industry but exacerbated in our case by the size of our overall workforce when compared to larger firms and the fact that we have diversified into new markets which currently have a relatively small, predominantly male talent pool.  This also applies to the bonus gap in the organisation, which is additionally impacted by the greater number of women working part time (whose bonuses are calculated pro rata).  Encouraging progress  We recognise the benefits of having more women in senior roles. It is an area we have been focused on for some time and where we are making encouraging progress.  In the past 18 months, for example, we have appointed two female non-executive directors and promoted from within to key positions such as Head of Change and Director of Operations and Service Solutions.  We have also launched a range of initiatives focused on encouraging and supporting women in their career progression, including:   appointment of an executive committee member responsible and accountable for driving our diversity agenda  introduction of a women’s network  mentoring and development programmes  leadership training   We are also in the process of implementing a more transparent reward structure and enhanced maternity and paternity pay in addition to a recent significant increase in entry level pay. We continue to support flexible working arrangements - in 2017, 94% of all requests were approved.  Everywoman partnership  To make sure we keep improving we have partnered with Everywoman , an organisation that helps businesses close the gender pay gap and enhances the potential of female talent, and will continue to work closely with them.  Whilst we have achieved a lot in a short space of time, we know there is more progress to be made which will require sustained focus and investment in training and development.  We are committed to reducing the gender pay gap in our organisation, and are confident that we will achieve significant progress over time.  What is the gender pay gap?    Equal pay  Is men and women being paid the same for the same work.     The gender pay gap  Is the difference between total hourly earnings for all men when compared to the total hourly earnings of all women within an organisation.   Nationally, one of the main reasons for the gender pay gap is that men are more likely to be in senior roles. As with other Financial Services companies this is the case at STB.    How is it calculated?    The STB median gender pay gap is 58%   The STB average gender pay gap is 52.6%   The average gender pay gap for financial services is circa 51%*  Secure Trust Bank Group results    Hourly pay   Gender pay gap mean 52.6%  Gender pay gap median 58%    Bonus pay   82.1% men received bonus  85% women received bonus    Bonus pay gap   Mean bonus gap 92.2%  Median bonus gap 51.5%      Gender representation by pay quartiles       * Source: Gov.uk - figures accurate as of November 2017          Website Terms Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Modern Slavery Statement Customer Charter Careers Newsroom   Terms & Conditions  Privacy Statement  Website Terms  Cookie Policy  Modern Slavery Statement  Careers  Customer Charter  Take Five to Stop Fraud  Newsroom             Secure Trust Bank PLC.
