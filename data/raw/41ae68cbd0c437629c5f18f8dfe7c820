It is widely recognised throughout these industries that there is a low representation of women in these sectors and it is inherently difficult to breakdown perception barriers, attract a gender balanced workforce and to recruit.  The pattern from the industry is reflected in the composition of Dyer & Butler's workforce. Women represent 18% of the Dyer & Butler monthly workforce total and whilst this is comparable to the transport and logistics industry level of 18%, the roles held by women are mainly at the lower end of the organisational structure undertaking administrative roles. Whilst in comparison the majority of management and technical roles which attract higher salaries are held by men.  Download our Gender Pay Gap Report for 2017.
