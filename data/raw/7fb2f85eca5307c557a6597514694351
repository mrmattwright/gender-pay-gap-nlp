We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business.  Observations:  The personal choice our colleagues make around their working patterns is a key driver in our gender pay gap – e.g. more of our male colleagues work according to a non typical work pattern which is reflected in their pay.  Engineering and Mixing represent two of our higher paid functions, both of which are male dominated sectors across UK manufacturing.  The remaining pay gap is largely attributed to the fact that more male colleagues are working in our senior roles.  With regard to bonus pay, a slightly higher % of our female colleagues actually received bonus pay in the reference period than our male colleagues.  All employees regardless of gender are included in our scheme.  In saying this, our mean gender pay gap in bonus pay was 28.4% due to our senior roles being male dominated.  Going forward  Whilst our pay gap is lower than the UK average, which would indicate that our current approach contains some positive elements, we are committed to reducing it further.  We will:-   work with local education colleges and schools to try and break down the perception that manufacturing offers careers for men only e.g. when recruiting engineering apprentices, we will seek to provide an environment that will encourage female applicants.  continue to communicate and where possible extend our flexible working patterns to enable/encourage female colleagues who want to remain in work after having children, to be able to do so.
