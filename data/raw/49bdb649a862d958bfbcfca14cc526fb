 

Background  

Gender Pay Gap Reporting 
 
1. 
 
In accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 
2017,  employers  with  250  or  more  employees  are  required  to  publish  statutory 
calculations no later than 30th March each year; commencing 2017/18.  
 
The information aims to establish the pay gap between male and female employees 
as at 31 March the previous year. For example, 31 March 2017 pay information must 
be published by 30 March 2018 on the employer's website. 
 
The  Equality  and  Human  Rights  Commission  defines  the  difference  between  equal 
pay and the gender pay gap as follows: 
 
1.  Equal  pay  means  that  men  and  women  in  the  same  employment  performing 

equal work must receive equal pay, as set out in the Equality Act 2010. 
 

2.  The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s 
average earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is expressed as 
a percentage of men’s earnings. 

 
Salaries at the Trust are determined through a national NHS job evaluation scheme 
called Agenda for Change (AFC). Job evaluation evaluates the job and not the post 
holder.  It  makes  no  reference  to  gender  or  any  other  personal  characteristics  of 
existing  or  potential  job  holders.  Therefore,  the  Trust  is  confident  it  is  paying  the 
same salary to roles of equal value. 
 
The legislation requires an employer to publish six calculations:  
 

•  Average gender pay gap as a mean average  
•  Average gender pay gap as a median average  
•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average  
•  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average  
•  Proportion  of  males  receiving  a  bonus  payment  and  proportion  of  females 

receiving a bonus payment  

•  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from 

lowest to highest pay. 

 
A  summary  breakdown  of  the  workforce  by  gender  and  pay  banding  as  at  March 
2017 can be found at the end of the report

Key Points: 
 
The  mean average  and median  hourly rate of pay is calculated from a specific pay 
period, in this case it is March 2017. The hourly rate is calculated for each employee 
based on 'ordinary pay' which includes basic pay, allowances and shift premium pay.  
 
The median rate is calculated by selecting the average hourly rate at the mid-point 
for each gender group.  
 
The  percentage  variance  for  the  average  hourly  rate  of  pay  is  just  over  31%.  This 
calculation  is  based  on  the  average  hourly  rate  of  3,704  female  staff  compared  to 
854  male  staff;  because  the  average  is  calculated  over  different  numbers  of  staff 
(there  are  four  times  more  female  staff),  some  variance  is  to  be  expected.  This  is 
also exacerbated by the fact that there is generally a significantly higher percentage 
of  male  staff  in  the  higher  paid  bands  or  professions,  such  as  doctors  and  senior 
managers. 
 
The  percentage  variance  for  the  median  hourly  rate  of  pay  is  16.6%.  For  our 
organisation  this  is  more  indicative  than  the  average  hourly  rate  of  pay  as  it  is 
impacted  less  by  the  female  to  male  ratio.  When  looking  at  the  variance  some 
consideration will need to be given to the variety of roles within the organisation.

Key Points: 
 
As an NHS organisation the only pay elements we have that fall under the bonus pay 
criteria  are  distinction  award  (Staff  grade  and  associate  specialist)  and  clinical 
excellence  awards  (consultants)  which  are  only  applicable  to  certain  groups  of 
medical staff.  
 
As  with  the  median  hourly  rate  of  pay,  this  is  based  on  the  mid-point  of  all  staff 
receiving bonus pay.

Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean and median average 

The  percentage  variance  for  the  bonus  hourly  rate  of  pay  is  10.4%.  However,  the 
percentage variance for the median bonus hourly rate of pay is 50%.  The difference 
may reflect the cumulative nature of the bonus which has some alignment to length 
of service as a medical consultant. The staff group identified in this section has 438 
staff, not all of whom are eligible for bonus pay. 60% of staff in this group are male. 
The  pay  elements  that  are  used  in  this  calculation  are  awarded  as  a  result  of 
recognition of excellent practice over and above contractual requirements, according 
to specific criteria and have no gender bias.

Key Points: 
 
This calculation expresses the number of staff receiving bonus pay as a percentage 
of the total number of staff in each gender group.  
 
Only certain medical staff receive pay that is classified as bonus pay. This group has 
a  significantly  different  gender  split  when  compared  to  the  Trust  as  a  whole.  The 
relevance  of  this  indicator  for  our  organisation  is  less  significant  as  bonus  pay 
applies to less than 7% percent of all staff employed.

Key Points:  
 
In  order  to  create  the  quartile  information  all  staff  are  sorted  by  their  hourly  rate  of 
pay, this list is then split into four equal parts (where possible).  
 
When reviewing the quartile information it is important to take into account the types 
of  roles  available  within  the  organisation  and  the  different  gender  splits  that  occur 
within specific roles.  
 
The highest variances for the quartiles when compared to the overall Trust value are 
in the lower, lower middle and upper middle quartiles. It is these quartiles which have 
the most pronounced gender split, where female staff are the predominant majority.

This is driving the mean and median pay differences. Included in the lower quartiles 
for instance are administrative & ancillary staff groups, such as Health Care Support 
Workers that traditionally have attracted a higher proportion of female staff.  
 
The  upper  quartile  has  a  lower  proportion  of  female  staff  than  the  other  three 
quartiles. The variance in this quartile is mainly due to significantly different gender 
splits in medical staffing and senior managerial roles in the Trust.

Actions 

a)  Further analysis of the gender split into the application for and award of bonus 

payments relating to consultant medical staff 
 

b)  Gender  analysis  undertaken  in  relation  to  the  Trusts  leadership  talent 

management work 
 

c)  Further analysis of the mean and median average pay gaps with the omission 
of  medical  staff  from  the  results  as  there  are  indications  that  it  is  this  staff 
group which has the most significant impact on the gender pay gap.
