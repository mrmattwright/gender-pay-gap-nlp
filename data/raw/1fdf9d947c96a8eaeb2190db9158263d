Message from our Management Team

At Lindt, our purpose is to make people feel special. A big part 
of this is about providing an open culture which impresses 
transparency, diversity and inclusivity. We have worked hard to 
provide a supportive environment where everyone can thrive.

Left to right:
James Waller Sales Director
Jenny Lawrence HR Director
Jan Boyle Shopper Marketing Director
Matt Austin CEO 
Faythe King Retail Director 
Adrian Mewse Chief Financial Officer
Annabelle Delorme Marketing Director

We welcome the government introduction of gender pay gap reporting, 
as this is in harmony with our belief that our people should be treated 
equally and fairly. Lindt UK is a sales and marketing organisation with 
a 69% female workforce and with 52% of employees in retail / retail 
merchandising sector positions.

We’re proud to be a top 30 Great Place to Work as rated by our people, 
with 94% proud to work for Lindt. We have a policy of equal pay 
for equivalent roles across our business regardless of age, gender or 
ethnicity. We manage this through evaluating each role in the market 
and ensuring we pay competitively. There is however a gap driven by 
our organisational structure. 

In recent years we have developed our practices as we have quickly 
grown from a small to medium-size company. Our progressive company 
philosophies provide opportunities for all, empowering people to make 
decisions that help them balance their lives in a way that works for them.

We will continue to implement actions that are guided by our purpose 
and values. This agenda to continually do better is embedded in our 
culture, and driven and fully supported by our Management Team, with 
progress discussed at our meetings throughout the year.

We confirm that the information in this report is accurate and meets 
the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Information) 
Regulations 2017. 
 

Matt Austin, CEO

What is the Gender Pay Gap?

The gender pay gap is a measure of 
labour market or workplace disadvantage, 
expressed in terms of a comparison 
between men’s and women’s average 
hourly rates of pay. 

It differs from equal pay, which is the 
right for men and women to be paid at 
the same rate of pay for work that is of 
equivalent value. So a company may  
have a gender pay gap if a majority of 
men are in senior roles, despite paying 
male and female employees the same 
amount for similar roles. 

What is the median? 

The median involves listing all the 
numbers in numerical order. The  
median is the middle number. We 
calculate the median for both men’s  
and women’s hourly pay and report  
the percentage difference.

What is the mean?

The mean average involves adding up  
all the numbers and dividing the result  
by the number of values in the list.  
We calculate the mean average for  
both men’s and women’s hourly pay  
and report the percentage difference. 

What’s included in our hourly pay 
calculation? 

Hourly pay includes basic pay, car 
allowance and London weighting 
allowance. Excluded are payments for 
overtime, pension, redundancy and 
benefits-in-kind (such as company  
car and private healthcare) along with 
employees on family or sick leave.  
This figure also includes a 1/12 bonus  
for Directors, which is paid in April  
and therefore taken into account as  
per the reporting requirements.

Gender pay is a complex issue and differs from equal pay, which is the right for men and 
women to be paid at the same rate of pay at equivalent value. We are confident that our men 
 Jenny Lawrence, HR Director
and women are paid equally for the same role.

Understanding Lindt’s pay gap

In this report we are providing our data across two distinct 
industry sectors – retail / retail merchandising and FMCG –  
as at 5 April 2017. 

In Head Office, whilst the majority of employees are female, 
the statistics are skewed by a small number of the most senior 
commercial positions mainly held by male employees. If we  
were to calculate the gender pay gap based on removing these 
few senior positions as at the snapshot date there would be a 
median pay gap of -5.5% and a mean pay gap of -3.3% across 
Lindt. We are however pleased to have balanced our Senior 
Management team, where 4 out of 7 in the team are female. 

In our retail stores, 76% of our employees are female. The  
gender pay gap in retail is 5.9%, which is significantly below  
the UK and company average. As at the snapshot date, we  
have more women store managers than men. We also have the 
majority of retail roles filled by women, which is typical of the 
occupational segregation in retail. We believe the chocolate 
advisor roles are particularly appealing to female applicants, in 
part due to the flexibility in work patterns. For the same role, 
regardless of gender, all our hourly paid colleagues are paid the 
same hourly rate and therefore the median is 0% for retail.

What’s our bonus gap?

The gender bonus gap is the 
difference between the average 
bonus received by men and 
women across Lindt UK  
during 2016/17.

pay between men and women:

Who received a bonus in 2016?

75%

Everyone employed between 1st January 2016 and 
commencing work before 30th September in the bonus 
year of 2016 is entitled to a share of our profits through 
our bonus scheme. This company and individual 
performance bonus is designed to reward our employees 
with a stake in our performance during the year. 

In Head Office, the number of employees receiving a 
bonus rises to 89% for female and 85% for men. In retail 
merchandising this is 95% for female and 86% for men. 

In our retail store environment, due to the number of 
females taking on flexible roles, they were not eligible 
for our bonus scheme under a zero hour contract 
arrangement. We have since offered permanent 
contracts to all applicable employees, who are now 
eligible to receive our bonus scheme. 

We recognise there is more work to be done in this area 
and we are working on a plan to address this.

In Head Office, 89% women and 85% men received a bonus. In retail merchandising this rose to 95% women and 86% men.

How pay is distributed

The distribution of men and women is shown in pay quartiles. These 
are calculated by splitting the whole workforce into four equal sized 
bands based on hourly pay, from highest paid to lowest paid. The 
percentage of men and women is calculated for each band. 

The proportion of women employed across Lindt UK is 69% which 
is broadly reflected in the top three quartiles. The lower quartile are 
not representative of our wider gender split, primarily due to the 
relatively high number of women employed within our retail division.

Our future and our growth rely on us providing the right 
environment for our employees to flourish where our 
engaged people can perform at their best. Our Great 
Place to Work engagement survey, undertaken annually 
and adjudicated externally, enables us to understand our 
organisation in greater depth and address development 
areas. We regularly review our scores against the top 
performing companies, and put plans in place each year  
to create a healthier and more engaged workforce.

Our commitment now and in future

Reward

We regularly review our total reward philosophy 
and have developed a model that drives 
consistency and fairness across our business. 

•  We have created a transparent and simple structure that 

rewards performance through evaluating each job and 
comparing this to an external benchmark.

•  We pay consistently and fairly when compared 

•  We continually evolve our reward policy through 

to market rates.

employee surveys.

•  In our retail stores we have moved away from zero 

hour contracts and now offer permanent roles enabling 
employees to have a share of our bonus. We are also 
working on a plan to address our retail pay philosophy.

Being at our best, both personally and professionally,  
is vital for our business and our wellbeing 

Flexible working

We are helping employees achieve a better work/ life balance, by improving the communication 
of all the opportunities employees can take advantage of depending on what life stage they’re at. 
Everyone has the opportunity to request to work flexibly and research shows that flexible working 
helps support those with caring responsibilities. We have recently included a review of all family 
friendly policies such as maternity and parental leave. Our recent maternity buddy scheme now 
provides greater confidence to new mothers returning to work. In recent years, we have had much 
success with our agile working scheme, providing greater flexibility for our people with initiatives 
such as core working hours, summer working hours and working from home.

Career Progression

Just some highlights include the launch 
of a bespoke career pathing tool, to help 
people map out their careers and achieve 
their ambitions. Coaching has also been 
introduced to encourage beneficial 
conversations with line managers. In 
addition, each function holds two people 
days per year dedicated to focusing on 
their people’s performance and their 
career ambitions, ensuring plans are in 
place to help them succeed. 

Learning & development 

Being at our best, both personally and 
professionally, is vital for our business 
and our wellbeing. We have focused on 
a number of significant learning projects 
over the last year, all with the aim of 
developing our capabilities, skills, talent 
and competencies, ensuring we create a 
sustainable and successful organisation  
at all levels in our organisation.
