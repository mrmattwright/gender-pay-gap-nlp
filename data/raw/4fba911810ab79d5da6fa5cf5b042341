The largest factor driving Onecomâ€™s gender pay gap is that a greater proportion of men (81%) are employed at 
a senior level, or in higher paid technical roles. These roles subsequently fall into the upper pay quartile. The fact 
that there are a greater proportion of men in the upper pay quartile has a significant impact on our gender pay 
gap. Within the lower middle and upper middle pay quartiles there is a near-on equal distribution of male and 
female employees. On average, Onecom employs the same proportion of both men and women in its middle 
pay quartiles.

Onecom employs a higher percentage of males in the lower paid quartile (65%), compared to women. Staff 
employed in our telesales teams have lower basic salaries, and the majority of staff within these teams are male. 
The lower salaries here are reflective of the fact that these employees have the opportunity to earn uncapped 
commission and bonuses.

Onecom will continue to appoint the best candidate for a position, regardless of their gender or other protected 
characteristics (defined by the Equality Act 2010).
