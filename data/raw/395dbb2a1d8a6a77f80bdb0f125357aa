 

Gender Pay Gap Report 

March 2018 

 

 

   

 

Introduction 

 

Regulations came into effect in 2017 that require organisations employing over 250 staff to 

carry out gender pay gap reporting. The two sets of Regulations introduced impose mandatory 

gender pay gap reporting on employers; the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public 

Authorities) Regulations 2017 and the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Reporting) 

Regulations 2017.  Both sets of Regulations are similar, however the Equality Act 2010 (Specific 

Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 apply to public sector employers, including fire 

authorities.   

Gender pay gap information must be published within ‘the period of 12 months beginning with 

the snapshot date’ (Regulation 2(2)). The snapshot date for public sector employers is 31 March 

each year. 

 

 

What is the gender pay gap? 

 

The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average earnings of males and females, 

expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings, e.g. females earn 10% less than men. The gender 

pay gap is reported on both the mean (average) and median (mid-point) basis. 

In the UK today, females earn on average 18% less than men (Source: CIPD Gender Pay Gap, 

closing it together 2017). There are a number of causes to the gender pay gap: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A higher proportion of males working in senior positions 

A higher proportion of females working in part-time roles (therefore normally earning less 

than their full-time colleagues) 

Skills gap, lack of training and development opportunities 

Lack of role models 

Family, childcare and caring commitments 

Lack of opportunities for flexible working 

Attitude and culture 

Confidence

 What is the gender pay gap? cont. 

 

It is expected that most organisations will have a gender pay gap in year one, however the next step is to 

take action to address the gap, therefore ensuring year on year the gap is reduced and eventually 

eliminated.  With organisations being required to publish their gender pay gap information in the public 

domain, this will allow greater comparison with other organisations and the Office of National Statistics 

(ONS) figures.  Greater transparency in pay will help to attract and retain talent and will provide the 

information to allow organisations to improve workplace practices, policies and procedures that will 

promote gender equality and ensure any remedial action is prioritised. 

 

 

How to explain the gender pay gap 

The gender pay gap is most commonly expressed as a mean average, which begins by scrutinising two 

sets of salaries to calculate the average remuneration for each gender.

magazine February 2018 

This expression of the gender pay gap does not imply (or rule out) unequal pay, which occurs when two 

people performing the same role are paid differently.  It more likely means there is an uneven distribution 

of genders at different levels—which may be a problem in itself.

Different to equal pay reporting 

 

Whilst both gender pay and equal pay deal with the disparity of pay females receive within the workplace, 

it is important to note that the gender pay gap is different to equal pay. 

The principle of equal pay is that males and females who carry out the same job, similar jobs or work 

of equal value, as set out in the Equality Act 2010, should receive equal pay 

Gender pay gap examines the difference in the average pay gap between males and females 

expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings and is not unlawful 

 

 

 

Organisations which are fully compliant with the Equality Act 2010 can still have a gender pay gap. This is 

often due to having more males in senior and highly paid positions and females in lower paid and part-

time roles.  The gender pay gap is a mechanism by which organisations can examine this data and take 

positive action to reduce the gender pay gap. 

 

 

What information must be reported? 

 

The gender pay gap calculations are drawn from specific data each year and based on full-pay relevant 

employees.  To be included as a full-pay relevant employee, the employee must be: 

Employed on the snapshot date; 31 March each year 

Paid their usual full pay in the pay period ending on the snapshot date  

 

 

 

Below details the standard information to be disclosed by organisations as part of the gender pay gap 

reporting as detailed in Schedule 1 of the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) 

Regulations 2017. 

 

Pay:  

This is the ordinary pay received by each full-pay relevant employee in the pay period at the snapshot 

date.  Ordinary pay includes basic pay, allowances, pay for leave and shift premium pay and calculated 

before deductions are made at source.  This data examines: 

 

 

 

 
 

The difference in the mean hourly pay between male and female relevant employees as a percentage 

of male pay (paragraph 8)  

The difference in the median hourly pay between male and female relevant employees as a 

percentage of male pay (paragraph 9)

 

The proportion of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower, lower middle, upper 

middle and upper quartile pay bands (paragraph 13) 

 

Ordinary pay does not include overtime, expenses, benefits in kind, arrears of pay, salary sacrifice schemes 

(such as childcare), tax credits or redundancy pay. 

 

Bonus:   

Bonuses paid to full-pay relevant employees in the 12 month period ending on the snapshot date (31 

March).  This data examines: 

The difference in the mean bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female 

relevant employees in the 12 months before the snapshot date (paragraph 10) 

The difference in the median bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female 

relevant employees in the 12 months before the snapshot date (paragraph 11)  

The proportion of male relevant employees who were paid bonus pay and that paid to female 

relevant employees in the 12 months before the snapshot date (paragraph 12)

BFRS Data 

 

Gender pay gap calculations for the Service as at 31 March 2017 are: 

Full Pay Relevant Employees  — Total 472 

This is the number of employees who received their normal full pay within the snapshot date.  This informs 

the mean and median hourly pay gap calculations and the proportion of employees within the Quartile 

Pay Bands. 

Relevant Employees — Total 488 

This is the number of staff employed by the Service on the snapshot date.  This informs the mean and 

median bonus pay gap calculations. The difference in number between relevant and full pay relevant 

employees is due to 16 employees not receiving their usual full pay within the pay period. 

 

 

Staffing numbers for the core employee groups  

The following information provides an overview of the decline in numbers for four core employee groups 

within the Service: Wholetime, Support Services, On-call and Control.

Since 2012/13 the Service has seen a decline in staffing numbers, including the transfer of Control Room 

staff to the Berkshire based Thames Valley Fire Control Service (TVFCS) in 2015/16.  

 

Since 2012, focus has been on transforming the Service. Whilst operating with considerably reduced 

funding following the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010, the Service has adapted to the 

changing circumstances.  Although there has been a significant reduction in staffing numbers, we have 

continued to operate without compromising the level of service provided to the community. This has 

also be managed without resulting in any compulsory firefighter redundancies or the loss of any fire 

stations or fire engines.

As detailed in Figure 4 (below) when analysing the data broken down by gender, there has been a 

greater reduction in the number of male employees. However, as this is the larger staffing group, this is 

to be expected. The reduction in females during the same period is largely due to the transfer of Control 

Room staff to TVFCS.

BFRS Reportable Data 

 

In accordance with the Regulations, the Service is required to annually publish six pieces of prescribed 

data about the pay and bonuses of males and females within the organisation:  

 

1. Mean hourly gender pay gap (paragraph 8) 

The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay for male and female full-pay relevant employees: 

Staff group 

Male hourly pay £  Female hourly pay 

Pay gap £  Pay gap % 

All staff 

18.10 

£ 

14.59 

3.51 

19% 

 

 

 

The mean (average) gender pay gap is 19%.  This means that male employees earn £3.51 per hour more 

than females and therefore, on average, females earn 81% when compared to male earnings. 

 

 2. Median hourly gender pay gap (paragraph 9) 

The difference between the median hourly rate of pay for male and female full-pay relevant employees:

All staff 

15.74

The median gender pay gap is 10.61% or £1.67 per hour. This means that on average, females earn 89% 

when compared to male earnings. 

 

3. Mean bonus gap (paragraph 10) 

The difference between the mean bonus paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female 

relevant employees.

* Negative pay gaps occur when females earn more on average, positive pay gaps are used when males 

earn more on average 

The mean bonus gap is -53.89%. This means that female employees received on average a bonus greater 

than £123.97 than males.  Although more male employees received a bonus, a higher proportion of 

females received a bonus than males.  The proportion is higher due to the fact that there are fewer 

females within the organisation.

4. Median bonus gap (paragraph 11) 

The difference between the median bonus paid to male relevant employees and that paid to female 

relevant employees.

All staff 

500

The median bonus gap is 100% or £500.  This means that female employees received a bonus equating to 

£500 more than male employees.  Although more male employees received a bonus payment,  75% of 

these received less than the median bonus pay amount for females (£1000), compared to 40% of females. 

In comparison 25% of male employees who received a bonus payment received more than the median 

bonus pay amount for females (£1000) compared to 60% of females. 

 

 

5. Bonus Proportions (paragraph 12) 

The proportion of male and female employees who were paid a bonus during the relevant pay 12 month 

pay period:

6. Quartile Pay Bands (paragraph 3) 

The proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower (L), lower middle (LM), upper 

middle (UM) and upper (U) quartile equally distributed pay bands are shown in the table below. 

To determine quartiles, employees were ranked in order of their hourly rate, from highest to lowest and 

divided into four equal groups, according to the guidelines.

When examining the structure of the organisation by role type i.e. senior management, middle manage-

ment, supervisory management and non-management, females are more evenly represented in each cate-

gory.  In the middle management category, 25% of the total group are female. 

 

The highest number of males and females are within the non-management role type category with num-

bers decreasing evenly for both males and females as you progress up each level of role type to the senior 

management level, which you would expect.

The role type categories are not reflective of the data within the quartile pay bands as non-management 

and supervisory management employees appear in each of the quartiles due to earning potential, i.e. addi-

tional roles, allowances and bank shifts.

Comparisons to other Fire & Rescue Services 

 

In year one of the gender pay gap reporting, full comparison data is not provided. However, before 30 

March 2018 there is a statutory obligation to publish gender pay gap information.  In subsequent reports 

benchmark analysis can be provided. 

Conclusion 

 

The results of the gender pay gap reporting for the Service as at 31 March 2017 finds that the mean 

gender pay gap is 19% when compared against the National UK gender pay gaps of 18% for 2017.  A 

recent CIPD study (Source: CIPD People Management magazine February 2018) analysed the gender pay 

gap figures from the first 570 organisations from both public and private sectors to report so far, which 

demonstrated a broad spread of mean averages of pay ranging from 64.8% to –12.9%, with the majority 

clustering between 25% and 0.   

 

Whilst there is no benchmarking data for year one, the fact that our gender pay gap is higher than the 

national average is a concern that requires immediate consideration. Our aim is to prioritise ways to lower 

the gender pay gap to below the national UK gender pay gap of 18% and to reduce it further. 

 

Gender pay gap reporting will help to raise the profile of gender issues within all organisations. The 

Service will strive to increase gender diversity in all areas of the organisation.  A particular priority for this 

Service is attracting and retaining a more diverse workforce and have better representation of males and 

females at all levels across the Service.
