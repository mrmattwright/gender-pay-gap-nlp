When your order is despatched, you will receive an email notification which will include a tracking reference and link.  This tracking link is clickable and will direct you to the tracking status with the courier.  Please note that tracking will not update until 12 hours from the despatch of your order.    Why have I been charged an additional charge on my delivery?

What is your ethical policy?    Whittard of Chelsea was established in 1886 with the principle of 'buying the best' and this still remains the cornerstone of the business today.  Our approach is to develop long-term relationships with suppliers. We only work with tea, coffee and hot chocolate specialists who take a responsible approach to their growers and working conditions.  We aim to source responsibly by using different certifications such as organic, fairtrade and RFA (Rainforest alliance) for different products. In addition we are continuously reviewing and improving our recycling policies so as to minimise our environmental impact.  We’re also a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), which aims to create a more sustainable industry by offering free training and support programmes to farmers, as well as tackling significant industry issues to help safeguard workers’ livelihoods.    What is the Whittard Gender Pay Gap?    At Whittard we aim to be a great place to work and want our employees to be happy and proud to work for us. Under government regulations all UK businesses with more than 250 employees are required to publish their gender pay gap. You can download the Whittard Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 here .    Why does my coffee have a short best-before date?    Whittard of Chelsea offers its customers premium coffee and tea; the best-before date on our fresh roasted and ground coffee is an advisory date for when the coffee is at its utmost freshest and best tasting.  Our coffee is dispatched to our Home Shopping Department within 7 days of roasting.  We have strict rules of rotation of the coffee to ensure our freshest coffee is being sold at any time.  Please be informed that this date does not mean the coffee is not usable after this time, as coffee does not go off, but rather loses its quality in flavour.  We offer a Taste Guarantee Policy, which means that if anything fails to meet your expectations you can return for an exchange or full refund.  Find out more about the Taste Guarantee policy here .  Please contact our Customer Service Team here should you have any concerns.    Does Instant Tea contain caffeine?
