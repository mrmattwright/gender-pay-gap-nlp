The gender pay gap is very different from equal pay, which is about equal pay for equal work. 
Whole Foods Market provides equal pay for equal work as required by UK law. At Whole Foods Market, 
we will continue to focus on improving our gender representation in senior levels and across our business.

The table above shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as the 
snapshot date (i.e. 5 April 2017). It also captures the mean and median difference between bonuses paid to 
men and women at Whole Foods Market in the year up to 5 April 2017. 

 

These figures are a measure of the difference in the average pay / bonus of men and women across the entire 
organisation; regardless of the nature of their work or level.  A positive figure is in favour of men and a negative 
figure is in favour of women.

The above image illustrates the gender distribution at Whole Foods Market across four equally sized quartiles. 
We will focus on improving our gender representation, particularly in the Upper Middle and Top Quartiles,     
and will continue to provide equal pay for equal work irrespective of gender, whilst fostering greater diversity.
I confirm the data reported is accurate.
