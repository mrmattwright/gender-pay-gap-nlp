Introduction 

 
 

 
Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council as a Public Sector organisation with over 250 employees is required by 
Gender Pay Gap legislation introduced in April 2017, to publish statutory calculations every year showing how 
large the pay gap is between their male and female employees i.e. the difference between the average (mean 
and median) hourly earnings of men and women who work here. 

This report provides details of the Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council’s workforce who are within the scope of 
the legislation as of 31 March 2017 and the gender pay gap calculations as required by the legislation.   

Our Workforce Profile 

 
 
 
 
 
For the purpose of Gender Pay reporting, relevant employees are all employees employed by the Council on 
the snapshot date – 31 March 2017.  This includes permanent and temporary employees employed as at 31 
March 2017, as well as those on casual contracts that were paid during the pay period ending 31 March 2017. 
 
Under  the  regulations,  the  workforce  of  our  maintained  Schools  are  excluded  as  the  governing  body  of  a 
maintained school is treated as the employer and required to publish their own calculations if applicable. 
 
Over the last 6 years there has been a significant reduction in the total number of SBC Employees.  It has 
reduced by over 25%, from 4,260 as at 31 March 2011 to 3,183 as at 31 March 2017. 
 
 
Gender Breakdown 
 
The Council has always had a predominately female workforce.   

 

As at 31 March 2017, 71% of the workforce was female which has remained unchanged year on year.  
This can in part be attributed to a greater number of female part-time workers across all areas of the 
Council and the flexible / family friendly working policies available.

The  greater  number  of  females  in  part  time  roles  can  in  part  be  attributed  to  the  variety  of  family  friendly 
policies available to our employees but also the greater number of female employees employed in jobs which 
are  not  required  full  time,  in  areas  such  as  Catering,  Cleaning,  School  Crossing  Patrol  and  Community 
Transport.

Gender Pay Gap 31st March 2017 

 

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly pay received by men and women across the 
Council as at 31 March 2017.  
 
We are required to calculate and report the following gender pay gap data:  

1.  Mean gender pay gap: The difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant 

employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees  

2.  Median gender pay gap: The difference between the median hourly rate of pay of male full pay relevant 

employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees  

3.  Mean bonus gap: The difference between the mean bonus paid to male relevant employees and that 

4.  Median bonus gap: The difference between the median bonus paid to male relevant employees and 

5.  Bonus proportions: The proportions of male and female relevant employees who were paid bonus pay 

paid to female relevant employees  

that paid to female relevant employees  

during the relevant period  

6.  Quartile  pay  bands:  The  proportions  of  male  and  female  full-pay  relevant  employees  in  the  lower, 

lower-middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands  

 
Please note that as the Council does not pay bonuses there are no figures to report for items 3, 4 & 5.

What is causing our Gender Pay Gap? 

The Council’s Corporate Management Team has a gender split of 33% Female 66% Male. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Council is committed to equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees.  Equal Pay legislation 
requires  for  men  and  women  to  receive  equal  pay  for;  the  same  or  broadly  similar  work,  work  rated  as 
equivalent under a job evaluation scheme, or work of equal value.  In line with this we have established pay and 
grading structures, founded on evaluation of job roles using job evaluation, which ensures a fair and transparent 
approach to pay and the same grading of jobs which are rated as equivalent work, regardless of their sex or any 
other characteristic.

Actions taken to reduce our Gender Pay Gap 

 
We are confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and women differently for the same 
or  equivalent  work.    Rather  it  is  as  a  result  of  the  type  of  roles  in  which  men  and  women  work  within  the 
organisation undertake and the salaries that these roles attract.  
Our positive gender pay gap shows that on average the hourly rate of pay for women is less than the average 
rate of pay for men.  This is partly due to the Council employing a large number of female workers undertaking 
lower  paid  roles  within  Services  including;  Cleaning,  Catering,  School  Crossing  Patrol,  Administration  and 
Community Transport.  In the majority of cases these roles are also part-time in nature which accounts for a 
greater number of female part time workers.  This is shown by the higher proportion of women employed in the 
Lower quartile of paid employment, compared to the Lower Middle, Upper Middle and Upper quartiles. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Council has already taken a number steps which will contribute towards reductions in our Gender Pay Gap 
including our continuing work to support the development of women in the organisation, a move towards the 
Living  Wage,  increasing  apprenticeship  rates  of  pay,  and  implementation  of  NJC  pay  awards.    We  are  also 
looking  at  the  utilisation  of  the  apprenticeship  levy  to  support  staff  development  opportunities  and  more 
smarter/flexible ways of working through our Smarter Working in Stockton programme.  We expect the changes 
to begin to impact over the next two to four years. 
 
 
Move towards the Living Wage: 
The  Council  are  committed  towards  paying  our  lowest  paid  employees  (excluding  apprentices)  the  National 
Living Wage.  As part of our commitment to move towards the Living Wage the Council agreed to delete the 
lowest  two  spinal  column  points  (SCP  8  &  9)  with  effect  from  1st  April  2016.    Our  lowest  paid  employees 
(excluding apprenticeships) are now paid at the bottom of our pay scale which starts at Grade C, spinal column 
point 10 at £7.89 per hour (1st April 2016).  This increased to £8.09 per hour from 1st April 2017. 
 
 
Pay Awards:   
In 2016, the Local Government representatives agreed a two year pay deal with trade unions effective from April 
2016.  For the lowest paid (those on spinal points 6-17) this meant a pay rise of between 6.6% and 1.01% in the 
first  year  (from  April  2016),  and  between  3.4%  and  1.3%  in  the  second  (from  April  2017).    Those  on  spinal 
points 18-49 received 1% in year one and the same again the following year.   
 
This pay deal will have a positive impact on the reduction of our gender pay gap data for 31 March 2018 with 
the second pay award having been implemented 1st April 2017.  
 
The proposed NJC pay awards for April 2018 & 2019 have yet to be finalised, but the current proposals would 
see higher increases on the lower pay points (SCP10 – 19) in order to continue to close the gap with the 
National Living Wage (NLW) and a 2% rise on SCP 20 and above.  The Council’s lowest pay point (SCP 
10) would under the current proposals increase from £8.09 per hour (April 17) to £8.74 per hour (April 18) 
and to £9.36 per hour (in April 19). 
 
Should this pay award be accepted by Trade Unions, the pay award will have a positive impact on the Council’s 
gender pay gap.  
 
 
Apprenticeship rates of pay: 
From 1st April 2016 the salaries attributable to apprentices within the Council are paid at the National Minimum 
Wage relating to age instead of the National Apprentice Wage.  The different rates of pay are outlined below:

Apprenticeship Levy: 
Legislation contained in the Finance Act 2016 introduced an apprenticeship levy payable by employers with pay 
bills over £3 million.  The levy came into effect from 6th  April 2017 and is paid at a rate of 0.5% of the Council’s 
pay bill.  The levy is being used to fund the cost of apprenticeship training for either new or existing employees.  
 
The  Council  will  utilise  the  apprenticeship  levy  to  support  training  opportunities  and  succession  planning 
opportunities for existing lower paid employees across the Council which will also contribute to our continuing 
work to support the development of women in the organisation. 
 
 
Smarter Working in Stockton (SWiS): 
Smarter Working  in  Stockton,  is  helping  the  Council  meet  the  key  challenges  of  budget  pressures,  reducing 
workforce  and  increased  demand for  services  that  it  is facing  in  the future.   It  provides  methods for meeting 
these challenges through the modernisation of working practices and improvement of work environments and 
benefits for employees.  There are many different ways in which an employee can work smarter; this will differ 
between job roles and services.   
 
SWiS is a way of working in which the Council empowers its Employees to work with maximum flexibility and 
minimum constraints in order to optimise their performance and deliver efficiencies.  It is based on the concept 
that work is an activity we do, rather than a place we go or in some cases a time it is carried out.  With the 
technology available to modern business, there are numerous tools to help us work in new and different ways, 
to meet customer needs, reduce costs, increase productivity and improve sustainability. We believe our SWiS 
programme will have a positive impact on recruitment and retention of our workforce and create greater work life 
balance options for employees.
