Select    Our people strategy and approach Diversity and inclusion Gender pay reporting for the UK Health and safety Human rights STEM Employee engagement Employee development                       Our people strategy and approach  We are committed to creating an environment where every employee can reach his or her full potential, by encouraging diversity, wellbeing and development.         Our people strategy and approach  We are committed to creating an environment where every employee can reach his or her full potential, by encouraging diversity, wellbeing and development.   We continue to develop our employee base, ensuring we have the right skills for our business today and the right capabilities for the future.  Our people strategy focuses on three key areas:  Enabling business transformation – Embedding a simpler organisation to introduce greater performance enablement, helping our people achieve their potential every day.  Building strategic capabilities – Developing key organisational, leadership, technical and functional capabilities for future performance and growth.  Creating a lean, agile, high performance culture – Achieving our strategic goals requires that we have the right cultural elements that support our workforce to be enabled, engaged and energised to drive performance and growth.                      A diverse and inclusive workforce  We continue to incorporate diversity and inclusion into everything we do. Diversity is critical to achieving a high performance culture and is a key enabler of innovation. We seek to embed diversity and inclusion in our employee training, communications and cultural change programme.               Global demand for Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) qualified employees continues to grow. Our need to recruit and retain locally based diverse leaders intensifies as our global footprint develops.    Our global Diversity and Inclusion strategy has four key phases: awareness, understanding, application and commitment.  Our goals are to:   Increase awareness and understanding of all employees of the value of diversity and inclusion  Build diversity and inclusion into the way we work  Drive commitment to diversity and inclusion   These ensure all employees are dedicated to making Rolls-Royce a place where all talent can thrive and succeed.      We continue to incorporate diversity and inclusion into everything we do. To support this, we have made three public pledges to diversity campaigns in the UK: Your Life Campaign – dedicated to encouraging more females to enter engineering and technology career paths  WISE 10 Step Plan – committed to improving the pipeline of women in to STEM The 5% Club – committed that 5% of our UK population is made up of young people on formal Early Career Development programmes We continue to see increased levels of diversity in our Early Career Development programmes, with females making up 23% of our graduate intake in 2016. Our general population is 15% female.  At a Board level we continue to participate in the FTSE 100 Cross-Company Mentoring Programme which aims to increase the number of eligible female candidates for Board positions. Females make up 23% of our Board profile.  We give full and fair consideration to all applications for employment made by people with disabilities and support disabled employees, helping them to make the best use of their skills and potential.                         Gender pay reporting for the UK   We’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive place to work where our people can be themselves and be at their best. We welcome the UK Government’s requirement for large companies to be more transparent on gender pay and in line with UK legislation we have published our gender pay data for our UK subsidiaries with 250 or more employees. We also show the total picture for Rolls-Royce in the UK regardless of employing entity.    UK Gender pay report 2017                  Health and safety  We regard the health and safety of our employees and those working on our premises, or on our behalf, as paramount. We are dedicated to providing a safe place of work for all our employees, contractors and visitors to our facilities.   Select Tabs   Our approach  Health and wellbeing  Employee and contractor safety   View all   Our approach  Health and wellbeing  Employee and contractor safety         Health and safety     Our approach  Health and wellbeing  Employee and contractor safety         Our vision and goals for health and safety and how we commit to achieve them are set out in our global HS&E policy.  We focus on three key areas:  Capability and culture To instil HS&E at the heart of everything we do, we need consistent, visible leadership and commitment from managers at all levels. We must also engage effectively on HS&E with all our employees.  Systems and processes As we continue to grow there is an even greater need for robust HS&E management. We continually strengthen our HS&E management system, running effective assurance programmes and sharing what we learn from incidents.  Risk-based improvement programmes We implement prioritised work programmes focused on key areas of risk. Recent examples include electrical safety, control of contractors and process safety.   A robust health and safety governance framework helps us to monitor and direct improvements in management and performance.  A main Board director has responsibility for HS&E; and the Board receives regular reports on progress. We have forums that range from local team meetings right through to strategic committees, involving members of the Executive Leadership team. A Board Safety and Ethics Committee oversees the operation of all HS&E;, Product Safety and Security policies, practices and procedures for the Group.  We are committed to full compliance with all relevant legal requirements and we continually monitor performance in all our businesses. Our HS&E management standards set out mandatory requirements for the evaluation of legal compliance. This forms a key aspect of our management system framework that meets the requirements of the Health and Safety management systems standard OHSAS 18001.  We have global certification to OHSAS 18001 for each of our businesses.              A healthy, resilient workforce is the cornerstone of a high performance organisation.  Our Occupational Health Strategy focuses on three areas:   Compliance – Managing occupation health risks  Developing resilience  Promoting wellbeing in a healthy workplace   The nature of our work has the potential to expose us to conditions that could harm our health. From noise and vibration to ergonomics and lifting, we continually invest in programmes and controls that mitigate these risks. Our occupational health providers conduct a full range of statutory surveillance medicals to look for any early signs of occupational disease.  The leading causes of illness are noise induced hearing loss, work-related upper limb disorders and stress. This reflects our global risk profile and provides the focus for our health improvement activities.  We have an internal health worksite scheme we call LiveWell. This award programme recognises sites that have taken steps towards creating supportive work environments where healthy choices are encouraged and rewarded. Sites are required to meet a stringent set of requirements to be accredited.               We are dedicated to providing a safe place of work for all our employees, contractors and visitors to our facilities.  We continue to analyse high-potential incidents and each of them is investigated at business level. Lessons learnt are shared across the Group. We develop our improvement programmes on high consequence activities in accordance with our risk profile. The number of high-potential incidents has declined slightly from previous years and the number of "near miss" reporting has significantly increased. This reflects our greater risk awareness, overall proactive reporting, risk based investigation and other improvements.  In 2016 our Total Reportable Injury (TRI) rate for employees was 0.60 TRIs per 100 employees, compared to 0.64 in 2014. There were no fatalities in the Group in 2016.  We require all contractors engaged by Rolls-Royce to acquire third-party prequalification before undertaking work. Prequalification of contractors is a small but important part of assuring ourselves that our contractors are competent to undertake the work activities we request of them.                     Human rights  We are committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards.              We are committed to maintaining and improving global policies and processes to avoid any potential complicity in human rights violations related to our operations or supply chain.    We have taken an integrated approach to minimising the risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place in our supply chain or any part of our business.  Our commitment to human rights, including our position on forced labour, involuntary labour, child labour, and human trafficking, is outlined in our Global Code of Conduct, Global Supplier Code of Conduct and Global Human Rights policy. Our principles related to human rights include:   We are committed to protecting and preserving the rights of our employees, those employed in our supply chain, and those affected by our operations;  We believe that all employment should be freely chosen and commit to refrain from any form of forced or involuntary labour;  We are opposed to the use of any form of child labour or practices that inhibit the development of children.       Human rights policy  Global Code of Conduct  Global Supplier Code of Conduct  2016 Anti-slavery statement                      Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM)  A strong future pipeline of well-qualified scientists and engineers is critical to the future success of our business.        Reaching 6 million people  We’ve set a global target to reach 6 million people through Rolls-Royce STEM education programmes and activities by 2020.     Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM)  A strong future pipeline of well-qualified scientists and engineers is critical to the future success of our business.   We hope that our STEM education programmes will inspire people to study the STEM subjects and show them the life-long opportunities that STEM careers can offer. Opportunities that might even include a career at Rolls-Royce.  By investing in STEM education we hope to widen the talent pool from which we – and our customers and suppliers - will recruit in the future, ensuring that we have the best people with the right skills to help fulfil our future responsibilities.  Globally we have around 1,400 Rolls-Royce STEM ambassadors who are actively involved in education programmes and activities.  More information on our STEM outreach target                             Employee engagement   An engaged and empowered workforce is critical to our success. Our managers have an important part to play in engaging their teams. We support their development to ensure they have the management and leadership skills they need. We encourage collaboration and use a variety of channels to communicate with our employees.
