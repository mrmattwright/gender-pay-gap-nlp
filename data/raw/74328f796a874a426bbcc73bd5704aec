Through our extensive training programme, we aim to equip our employees with the technical, leadership and management skills they require to be successful in the future.  A particular focus on the development of our workforce continues to be on promoting diversity and opportunity to ensure the company is a great place to work for all.  As an equal opportunies employer, we respect and value everyone’s contribution.          Read our gender pay gap report   We are committed to providing an environment that supports and encourages the many skills, interests, backgrounds and experiences that people from different social groups can bring.  We strive to provide a workplace which is free from discrimination, harassment and bullying, and where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.   86%  of staff rated us as a good company to work for and 77% rated us a great place to work, according to a staff survey in 2017.  Diversity  We value the differences that a diverse workforce brings and are committed to creating an inclusive workplace for all employees and others who work with us as suppliers, contractors, consultants or customers.  Promoting diversity and inclusion continues to be a key focus and we have implemented a range of diversity initiatives including:   policies on hearing loss  hosting a Women in Sustainability networking event to promote and encourage membership within our company  being an active member of the Business Disability Forum.   In 2017, there were 2,177 employees.  21%  of our employees are women; 79% are men. In terms of leadership, 18% of those role are held by women. There are three women and 10 men on our board of directors.  In common with many businesses with a predominance of STEM skills, such as engineering, the water industry has been male dominated.  We recognise that diversity is a strength and are working to create an inclusive environment to improve the representation of women within the industry and our own business.  When it comes to pay, we're confident that our approach is not influenced by gender. You can find out more in our Gender pay report 2017.
