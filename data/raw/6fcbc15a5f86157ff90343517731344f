At Two Counties Cleaning Services Ltd, we ensure that all employees are paid fairly and have the same opportunities regardless of whether they are male or female.  The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average earnings of men and women. It is now a legal requirement by the UK government for all employers with 250 or more employees to publish this data by April 2018. The snapshot date for the data that has been collated is April 2017.  The data to the right has been compiled by Trevor Jackson, Managing Director.  The mean gender pay gap is 2.2% which is significantly lower than the UK average. Our median pay gap is 0% which means that there is no median pay gap. We work in a female dominated industry where operatives are on the same wage regardless of their gender. The only influence on rates of pay is the location of the site that an employee works. If an employee works in a remote location where it is difficult to recruit then we offer a higher hourly wage.  Due to the minimal gender pay gap, there is no action that will be taken at this time.
