The gender pay gap shows the difference in earnings between all male and female employees in an organisation as at 5th April 2017.    At 5 th April 2017, Gary Gabriel Associates was wholly owned by Fairhurst and the combined organisation employed over 250 employees.    We are required to report in six different ways;   Mean gender pay gap in hourly pay  Median gender pay gap in hourly pay  Mean gender bonus gap  Median gender bonus gap  Proportion of men and women who received bonuses  Number of men and women in each quartile pay band     The results for Gary Gabriel Associates are as follows:  .                                         Mean    Median  Gender Pay Gap               40.6%    34.3%  Bonus Pay Gap                  n/a         n/a  A positive percentage figure means that overall, female employees have lower pay or bonuses than male colleagues. A negative figure means that overall male employees have lower pay or bonuses than female colleagues. The roles and responsibilities  of individual employees does not feature in the calculation of the percentage comparisons.    Proportion of male employees receiving a bonus:              6.7%  Proportion of female employees receiving a bonus:          0.0%    The proportions of males and females in each quartile band are as follows:  Band      Males    Females               Quartile  A             44.4%    55.6%                     Lower  B             80.0%    20.0%                    Lower-Middle  C             90.0%    10.0%                    Upper-Middle  D             100.0%  0.0%                      Upper    The former Gary Gabriel Associates staff transferred to Fairhurst on 1 st November 2017. These employees will form part of Fairhurst’s gender pay gap data going forward.    While Fairhurst operates in a historically male-dominated industry, we are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our firm.    The narrowing gap in proportions of male and female employees in the Lower quartile demonstrates the progressive change away from the historically male-dominated industry.    Principles of non-discrimination are enshrined in Fairhurst’s recruitment and promotion procedures. All recruitment and promotion decisions are made on merit.    I confirm that data contained in this report is accurate.
