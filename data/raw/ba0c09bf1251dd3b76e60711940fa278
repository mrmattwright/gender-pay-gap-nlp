GENDER PAY REPORT

1

INTRODUCTION

Styles&Wood Ltd is a leading property 
services provider.  With 328 UK 
employees, across 3 regional centres, 
Manchester, Nottingham and London, we 
are committed to ensuring Styles&Wood 
Ltd is a place for all, by celebrating and 
supporting diversity and inclusion. We are 
keen to ensure that all of our opportunities 
for employment, progression, and career 
development are fair and this is reflected in 
all of our policies and procedures. 

Like any business operating in the 
traditionally male-dominated construction 
industry, we face the challenge of 
increasing the representation of women in 
senior roles within our company. This is an 
area in which we’re already making good 
progress and in this document you’ll see 
our action plan for how we plan to close 
our gender pay gap.

GENDER PAY 
REPORTING 

REQUIREMENTS

As of April 2017, all UK organisations 
which employ over 250 employees are 
required to report annually on their 
gender pay gap* and Styles&Wood Ltd 
has published the following data on the 
required six metrics;

•  The difference between the mean hourly 

rate of pay of relevant male full-pay 
employees and that of relevant female full 
pay employees (‘the mean gender pay 
gap’)

•  The difference between the median hourly 

rate of pay of relevant male full-pay 
employees and that of relevant female full 
pay employees (‘the median gender pay 
gap’)

•  The difference between the mean bonus 

pay paid to relevant male employees and 
that of relevant female employees (‘the 
mean gender bonus gap’)

•  The difference between the median bonus 
pay paid to relevant male employees and 
that of relevant female employees (‘the 
median gender bonus gap’)

•  The proportions of relevant male and 

female employees paid bonus pay (‘the 
proportions of men and women getting a 
bonus’) 

•  The proportions of relevant male and 
female employees in the lower, lower 
middle, upper middle and upper quartile 
pay band (‘the proportion of men and 
women in each of four pay quartiles’)

*The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. Equal pay relates to men and women being paid 
the same amount for the same role, and is a legal requirement.

INFLUENCING THE 
GENDER PAY GAP

Styles&Wood Ltd operates in the 
construction industry, which has 
traditionally been male dominated. As 
of March 2017, 13% of the industry’s 
workforce was female.*  Female 
representation in our workforce is 
comparatively favourable at 29%, although 
we recognise the need to increase this 
proportion, and are working to do so 
with female-focussed apprenticeship 
and training schemes.  We have seen 
success with this approach and female 
representation has increased from 18% in 
2015.

The above data indicates our gender 
pay gap, not equal pay. A significant 
driver to our gender pay gap is the 
representation of women in senior roles 
within our business. We are committed to 
providing a variety of training schemes 
and progression opportunities to ensure 

that our future gender pay gap aligns with 
the success we’ve had in increasing our 
gender representation. In conjunction with 
a local school we undertake the SHE girls 
club whose aim is to support and develop 
confidence in girls aged 13 up to 16 and 
make them aware of the possibilities of a 
career in property services.  We ensure 
apprenticeships and graduate opportunities 
are actively promoted to women through 
our school and university networks. 

We have introduced flexible working 
for all staff including compressed hours, 
home working and flexible start and finish 
times, allowing both men and women in 
our organisation to work around family 
commitments and ensuring that we can hire 
based on talent rather than peoples’ ability 
to work to a rigid working schedule.  Skype 
for Business has also been rolled out across 
the business and a Techsave scheme is 

available to support employees purchasing 
IT equipment.

We are pleased that the proportion of 
females in our upper quartile is the same as 
the upper middle as we have been focussed 
on attracting females to senior roles in our 
business which is having a positive impact.  
We aspire for this to increase to 30% by 
2020.

Bonus schemes are available to Senior 
Managers relating to Business Unit 
performance and Project based staff 
relating to the outcome of specific projects. 
In these senior roles, bonuses are a larger 
part of remuneration.

PAY SYSTEMS

We have a robust grading system that is 
applied across the organisation and ensure 
that this is used to set fair levels of pay for 
all employees regardless of gender.

We acknowledge the gap and, through 
the leadership team’s continued emphasis 
on equal pay at the compensation review, 
we will continue to analyse pay and bonus 
outcomes to ensure that pay decisions are 
fair.

I confirm that this statement is true to the 
best of my knowledge and belief
