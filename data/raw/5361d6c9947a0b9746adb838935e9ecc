There are several factors within our business that affect our overall Gender Pay Gap.  

The majority of our roles are within our Merchandising Division and these roles are part-time 
working anything from 1 hour per week to 18 hours and a high percentage of these roles are 

occupied by women. 

Within Merchandising there are two set pay scales, we have a standard rate of pay and a London 

Weighting Rate of Pay (this is payable depending upon the postcode of the store where the 

contracted hours are worked) and all employees who occupy the role of Merchandiser or Team 

Controller are all paid equally.

Bonus Pay

Our Commitment

As you will see below, more females receive bonus payment, the 
overall figures are impacted due to the overall female versus male 
headcount. We have a large majority of employees employed as part 
time merchandisers who are predominately women and this is 
reflected in the figures shown.

We are confident that our Gender Pay Gap is not as a result of men 
and women being paid differently to do the same job but is driven by 
the structure of how our workforce is made up. Whilst it is our overall 
aim to reduce the Gender Pay Gap this is not always possible due to 
the structure of our business.

We care about our people and aim to ensure that our pay system is 
free of bias. Fairness and equality across gender, age, race, disability, 
sexual orientation, marital status, religion or belief are part of the values 
of UK Greetings and enforced by our Equality and Diversity policy. 

In order to ensure equal pay within UK Greetings, we will continue to:

   Review and analyse current job roles and current pay
   to identify where gender bias may occur.

   Agree and apply solutions to remedy any areas of concern.

Carry out regular monitoring of pay statistics, reviewing the
impact of pay policies and practices taking appropriate remedial 
action to resolve any issues identified.
