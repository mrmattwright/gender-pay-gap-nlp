This includes the mean gap, the median gap and the proportion of female and male employees in each quartile band.  Organisations must also publish data on bonuses, however Victim Support does not pay any employee a bonus, so this is not relevant.  What is a gender pay gap?  The term gender pay gap refers to the difference between what is paid to male and female employees when analysed collectively.  Mean, median and quartile bands  The mean is the average of a set of figures. The median is the middle number of a set of figures when they have been ranked by size.  Quartile bands divide data organised by size into four equal parts, with the first quartile showing 0-25% of the data — the lowest numbers — and so on.  Victim Support data  Victim Support does have a gender pay gap. For the financial year 2017/2018, women’s mean pay is 17.6% lower than men’s, while women’s median pay is 6.8% lower than men’s. As mentioned above, no employee receives a bonus at Victim Support.  The distribution of employees across quartile bands is:    Female  Male  Quartile 1 (lowest pay)  88%  12%  Quartile 2  88%  12%  Quartile 3  85%  15%  Quartile 4 (highest pay)  74%  26%  Why does Victim Support have a pay gap?  The Victim Support workforce is predominantly female, with 922 women (84%) and 182 men (16%). This means that women have roles which span from the lowest to the highest paid positions.  There is no evidence that our gender pay gap is caused by differences in pay for men and women working in the same role or position.  The gap arises because the ratio of women to men at Victim Support decreases at higher levels of the organisation — meaning there is a higher percentage of men in managerial positions when we compare this to the percentage of men and women in more junior roles. This influences both the mean and median gaps.  Changes since 5 April 2017  It is worth noting that the figures above represent a snapshot of the data taken on 5 April 2017.  Changes to the National Support Centre, the Senior Management Team and the recent appointment of Victim Support’s new Chief Officer, Diana Fawcett , reduces the mean gender pay gap down to around 14% and the median pay gap to 6.7%.  What action is Victim Support taking?  Victim Support is an equal opportunities employer.  Our policy is to ensure that no victim, witness, employee, volunteer, trustee, or job applicant receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, ethnicity, religion/faith, age, gender identity, pregnancy or maternity, marital status, sexual orientation or disability, or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements which cannot be shown as justifiable.  In our regular reviews of our selection criteria and procedures we will be assessing our appointment processes to find out if there is any evidence of systematic gender bias which could be contributing to this pay gap. If any evidence is found we will act swiftly and robustly to address this - both in policy and in practice.      back to top   back to top       Crime info What is a crime?
