GENDER PAY GAP
REPORT 2017

Greene King is committed to fairness, inclusion and equality.  
We are confident that we have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that men and women are 
paid fairly for the roles that they perform. However we do employ more women in lower paid roles, 
particularly in customer facing pub based roles, with fewer in management positions and this is  
reflected in some of the figures.

Greene King employees are employed by one of two companies:

Greene King Retail  
Services Limited

GK Retail

This comprises primarily of  
pub based employees below 

management level.

Greene King Services Limited

GK Services

This includes employees in our brewery  
and distribution centres, most of our pub  
based management and support services  
including head office and operational support.

This report provides information for both employing companies and the combined entity.

Our mean gender pay gap is minimal in the core part of our business where most people are  
employed, but higher in GK Services due to the larger number of men in senior management roles. 

Our mean gender bonus gap is negative in GK Retail - ie women received higher bonuses than men, 
though it is worth noting that relatively few employees are eligible for a bonus in this population, 
while in GK Services the higher number of men in senior management roles meant that the average 
bonus of men was higher.
