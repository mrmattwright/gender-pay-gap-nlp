In 2018, for the first time UK Companies with over 250 employees have to report on their gender pay gap.  WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?  The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean or median) earnings of men & women regardless of the nature of their work - It looks across the entire company. It can be influenced by the different number of men and women across all roles.  Gender and Bonus Pay Gap  The median pay gap is calculated by listing all male employees hourly pay rates and taking the rate in the middle of the list. The same is done for female employees & then the median gender pay gap is the difference in pay between these two rates.  The other measure is the mean gender pay gap which shows the difference in the average hourly rate of pay between men & women.  Our Results – Pay – Hourly Rate       Day Lewis  UK*    Median Pay gap  5.2%  18.4%    Mean pay Gap  22.3%  17.4%      Based on estimates from the National Office of Statistics Survey 2017   BONUS PAYMENTS  A similar calculation to the one carried out for pay- hourly rates is done for bonus payments. The results are as follows –        29.7%                                 40.3%  Median                               Mean         The proportion of men and women employed who received a bonus         80.9%                                 79.6%  Men                                    Women        PAY QUARTILES  This is the proportion of Male and Female colleagues in each pay quartile.           Lower Quartile  27.3%  72.7%    Lower Middle Quartile  23.4%  76.6%    Upper Middle Quartile  25.8%  74.2%    Upper Quartile  43.6%  56.4%       UNDERSTANDING THE GENDER PAY GAP  The main driver between Gender Pay Gap is that at Day Lewis Plc we have a higher representation of females (> 70%) in pharmacy in roles such as pharmacy technicians, dispensers and counter assistants. We employ around 330 pharmacists with an equal number of men and women.  As a female Executive Director at Day Lewis Plc I am proud to champion equality and diversity with our business. We remain committed to identifying talent and developing all our colleagues both male and female. Day Lewis continues to be an employer of choice for females wanting to work in the pharmacy sector and many of our employees have been rewarded for long service and loyalty.  I confirm that the information contained within this report is accurate.
