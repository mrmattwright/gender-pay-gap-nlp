Proudly  British & Independent         Our History  Humble Beginnings         AMT was created in 1992 by the three McCallum-Toppin brothers. When Alistair arrived in Oxford from Seattle in 1992, one of the first things he noticed was that his craving for real espresso coffee was no where to be found. Therefore, Alistair asked his two brothers Angus and Allan to join him in creating a new, unique, top quality coffee company which they would name after their initials.
