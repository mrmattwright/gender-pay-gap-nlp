The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings. For example, ‘men earn 15% more than women per hour’.  Employers must both:   publish their gender pay gap data and a written statement on their public-facing website    report their data to government online - using the gender pay gap reporting service .   If your organisation has fewer than 250 employees, it can publish and report voluntarily but is not obliged to do so. For more information on the requirements please click here .

As the contractors are legally classified as our employees, we are required include their details within our Gender Pay Gap Reporting. However, it is worth noting that the arrangement that a compliant umbrella company operate for tax and employment purposes means that every contractor is paid a basic wage of the National Living Wage plus a bonus to make the figure up to the daily or hour contract rate agreed for their services. As such our figures may distort the projection that the Government Equalities Office were looking to achieve.  As you will see, the contracting market is quite heavily male dominated with only 1 in 2.65 contractors being female (down from 1 in 3 in 2016/17), this may be due to circumstances of females returning to work post families. We also tend to see that at the higher end of the quartile there are fewer females entering into this profession because of the lack of security with regards to consistent income. Working as a contractor in the UK can mean that you may be in a position whereby there are times within an annual period whereby no work is available, or not required, therefore we tend to see higher rates of pay to cover this and the niche skill set available to end clients, this may limit the number of contractors who would feel comfortable to engage in this type of working. Some males or females may not feel comfortable with the uncertainty of roles available.  As most of the contractors' source their work either on their own or via a recruitment agency, ContractorUmbrella has little involvement in the rates that are agreed prior to commencing their employment with us and as such are reliant on the recruiters understanding current market requirements and the appropriate rates available to contractors.  This statement confirms that the published information is accurate as at the time of publishing and is signed by Lucy Smith, Managing Director.  March 2017 - Updated in line with Government Equalities Office guidance to amend the quartile figures.  April 2018 - Updated figures for 2017/2018         Why Choose ContractorUmbrella?
