At Warburtons, our people 

make the difference. 

our success has, and 

will continue to be 

made possible by the 

contribution our people 

make every day.

We are the only food manufacturer to have appeared in The Sunday 
Times Best Big Companies to Work for List for three years running. 
This demonstrates our efforts in creating a positive and values based 
culture where our people feel fairly treated, engaged and valued. 

However, we recognise that we need to ensure our business offers 
ways of working to suit all people and lifestyles, which in turn will 
help us to attract more women to join our business. To support this, 
we have implemented significant change across our manufacturing 
sites, ‘Agile Operations’, this included a landmark deal with the 
Bakers union that gives us potential access to a wider talent pool. 

Attracting and retaining top talent through fair and equitable talent 
management processes is an important focus at Warburtons as 
we believe our people give us the competitive advantage. We 
also have a specific focus on encouraging and supporting women 
leaders in business, both in our own organisation and by connecting 
with others through our Regional Women in Leadership network.

We strive to be a fair and progressive employer, that allows 
everyone to reach their full potential regardless of gender, age or 
background and are committed to building a diverse and inclusive 
workplace with people at its heart.
 
 

Susan Yell,
HR Director

contribution they make. To do this we are 
continually looking at the way  we operate 
to ensure that we can make working 
at Warburtons an option for everyone, 
regardless of their gender,  
age or background.

What is the gender pay gap?

The gender pay gap is the difference between the average pay of men and women. Various factors influence the gap such as the types of 
roles women undertake and the demographics of the people at the company. This is the first time, all UK companies employing 250 people 
or more are required to report on their gender pay gap by 4th April 2018. Having a gender pay gap is not unlawful however it is important 
that businesses become more focussed on bridging the pay gap that exists in the UK today.

THE GENDER PAY GAP IS DIFFERENT 
FROM EQUAL PAY

‘Equal Pay’ is where men and women are paid different rates of pay for performing the same role,  
a similar role or a role which is of equal value.

What do we have to report on? 
The regulations require organisations to report on the mean and median gender pay gap, the mean and median bonus gap, confirm the percentage of men and 
women who received a bonus and also provide details on the gender balance of our work force based upon quartiles.

Mean PAY GAP

The mean gender pay gap 
is the difference between 
the average pay of men and 
women in a company.

MeDIAN PAY GAP
A median is the midpoint of a population. So simply, if you created two 
lines arranged according to the pay received – one with all the women 
in a company, and the other with all the men, the median pay gap is the 
difference in pay between the middle person in each line.

Proportion of men and women paid a bonus 
Rewarding our people is important to us 
and around 90% of employees receive a 
bonus, primarily through our Profit Share 
scheme. The Warburtons Profit Share is 
designed to reward loyalty and therefore 
includes an element based on length of 
service, and as we have a higher proportion 
of longer serving men, this drives their 
profit share up and creates the gap.
