Gender Pay Gap Reporting  Under new legislation, UK companies with more than 250 employees are required to report on their gender pay gap – the difference between the average amount per hour that women and men are paid across the whole workforce. The gender pay gap is not about equal pay for men and women doing the same job.  It’s a broad measure of gender equality in the workplace.  As a socially responsible employer we actively welcome the opportunity to publish our gender pay gap data in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
