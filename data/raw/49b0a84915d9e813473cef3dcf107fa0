The gender pay gap gives a snapshot of the gender balance within an organisation. It measures the difference between the earnings of male and female employees, irrespective of their role or seniority.  It is distinct from equal pay, which is about ensuring that men and women are paid the same for carrying out equal work.  The gender pay gap data is a valuable tool to help understand why our own business and our industry are missing out on female talent. Gender pay gap reporting is a critical step in our plans to attract, retain and develop a diverse talent population.  Six calculations are required:  • Mean gender pay gap  • Median gender pay gap  • Mean bonus gender pay gap  • Median bonus gender pay gap  • Proportion of males and proportion of females paid a bonus payment  • Proportion of males and females in each pay quartile  The gender pay gap data is calculated using the hourly rates of pay, earned by each relevant employee during their relevant pay period, that includes the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.  The bonus pay gap data is calculated using the bonuses paid to relevant employees during the period 6 April 2016 to 5 April 2017 inclusive.  Our ‘gender pay gap’ is shown below. This is a snapshot of the difference between the hourly pay levels of women compared to men, irrespective of their role or level in the organisation, expressed as a percentage of male earnings.  Our figures show that the median pay of our women in the UK is 23.1 per cent lower than that for our men.  For comparison, the UK’s national median gender pay gap is 18.4 per cent.     Our gender pay gap is driven by two key things:  – Women are less well represented in the top and middle pay quartiles and this is a result of us having fewer women in senior leadership roles which sit in these quartiles  – Almost half of our organisation consists of engineering roles. Engineering UK’s 2017 report stated that only 15 per cent of students entering a first degree in engineering and technology were female. This means we have a relatively small pool of female talent from which to recruit.  THE POSITIVE ACTIONS WE’RE TAKING…   We will work to ensure our recruitment; training, development and career progression plans are free from gender bias  We are thoughtful about our branding and media to ensure that we appeal to as diverse an audience as possible  We have already taken steps to ensure that our recruitment and promotions processes are free from gender bias  We are committed to increasing year on year, the number of women recruited for our graduate and apprenticeship programmes  We are undertaking to play a key role in the STEM Ambassador outreach Programme, working with local schools in the South Wales and Hastings areas to help local school children understand more about careers in STEM and promote female role models  Improve the development and support of entry level and junior female engineers  We have introduced a requirement that for all leadership roles in non-engineering functions across the organisation we will have gender-balanced shortlists as a prerequisite to moving forward to interview stage  By the end of 2018, all our employees will have undertaken unconscious bias training  We will continue to promote our current culture of embracing flexible working.
