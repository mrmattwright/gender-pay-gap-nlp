Come and be part of something amazing. As the North East of Scotland’s largest social care charity we employ more than 500 people across Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. As our services develop and change to meet the ever increasing need for social care provision in our local communities so does our need for exceptional staff. We often have a range of exciting and well rewarded employment opportunities that really will let you make a difference.  We value our workforce and we demonstrate a firm commitment to them. Since first being recognised by the Investors in People programme in 2002, we have continued to develop, grow and support our workforce. This commitment has paid off: we can now boast better than national average for staff qualification rates; our Care Inspectorate grades are the best we have seen; and even in times of national austerity our staff turnover continues to fall.  All of these factors contribute directly to the care we provide and the quality of outcomes for the people in our care.  In recognition of all this hard work, VSA was awarded Investors in People Gold accreditation in June 2015. This represents a true commitment to employees and demonstrates a solid foundation of good practice which remains challenging and aspirational for many organisations. Achieving the Gold level of Accreditation puts VSA in the top 7% of all IIP Accredited clients.
