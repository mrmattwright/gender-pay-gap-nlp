Pinterest                2018 gender pay gap report      We published our first gender pay gap report on 11th March 2018. In the report, we confirmed that we have a mean gender pay gap of 11.5%. This is largely a result of a higher concentration of women in more junior grades, where pay is lower, and fewer female staff in more senior grades.           Reducing the pay gap at Kew      We are doing everything possible to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and equally while working at Kew.  We have shortened our pay scales and removed overlapping between grades, which mitigates the effect of higher pay for longer-serving male staff.  We will continue to monitor pay to identify pay differences and act, where appropriate and where budget and pay constraints allow.  We actively support women to work at Kew or return to work from maternity or adoption leave, removing barriers and utilising a range of flexible working options available for all employees. We equally offer these opportunities to men, to enable all employees to fulfil their caring responsibilities irrespective of gender.  We will use the results to assess levels of gender equality and the balance of men and women at different levels as well as reviewing data on recruitment and promotion.  We’ll also be discussing the results with our Gender at Kew group and identify further actions we can take.
