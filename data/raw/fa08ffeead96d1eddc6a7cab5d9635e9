We operate in true partnership with our customers to become an extension of existing recruitment teams. Through dedicated consultancy services we strive to promote long term staff development within your business rather than focus on short term gain.”     Quattro Recruitment Gender Pay Gap Reporting  Quattro Recruitment Gender Pay Gap Statement  From April 2017 all organisations that employ over 250 employees are required to report annually on their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap shows the difference between the average (mean/median) earnings of men and women.  Quattro Recruitment is a leading provider of temporary and permanent staffing to the Industrial, Commercial and Healthcare sectors.  Working in partnership with clients we place more than 2,000 Temporary candidates every week.  The definition of “employee” for gender pay purposes includes a large number of our temporary workers. These are workers engaged by us but placed on assignment with our clients.  Although we ensure our temporary workers are paid fairly and in accordance with all legislation (including National Minimum Wage legislation and the Agency Workers Regulations 2010), we have limited influence over the pay of these workers as it depends on the rate specified by a particular client.  Without the ability to influence or change pay rates there is little scope to implement solutions.  We supply workers to a range of clients across a number of different sectors.  These workers will be placed in a variety of roles so it is challenging to compare Bonus data.
