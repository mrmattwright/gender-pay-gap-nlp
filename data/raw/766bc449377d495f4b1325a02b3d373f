My carers are dependable and kind and make me feel secure.  - Kate, a Service User from Kensington            "I cannot praise my carers enough, they are wonderful and caring people and it is a great support to know that they are with my husband while I am at work. The flexibility is also great as I work such inconsistent hours, but Healthvision are able to fit around my work and the carers will often stay longer if they are needed."  - Mary, Service User Next of Kin            "I have helped service users to receive home care from Healthvision on several occasions.
