5.  The proportion of men and women who received bonus pay; and 
6.  The proportion of full-pay men and women in each of four quartile pay bands.

At Monkton we are committed to paying all of our people equal pay for equal work. We recognise that, like 
many employees in the education sector and, indeed, nationally, we have a disproportionate number of 
females working in our lower paid roles, such as our domestic and administrative support staff.  

As an employer we are regularly reviewing the salaries of our people, comparing them to national and local 
benchmarks to ensure that the pay remains appropriate to the role performed. Furthermore, the School is 
committed to increasing the pay of our lowest paid and we continue to work to increase our pay so that 
our lowest paid will be paid at the rate advocated by the Living Wage Foundation.
