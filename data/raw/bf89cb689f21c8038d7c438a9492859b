Under new legislation that was introduced in April 2017, UK employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish their gender pay gap. This shows how big the pay gap is between the mean average and median pay of their male and female employees. It must not be mistaken for equal pay. Equal pay requires that men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs, or work of equal value, are paid the same. Calculating the gender pay gap involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women across the organisation. Sentinel Leisure Trust are required to publish the results on their company website and also a government website. The following information is based on 274 members of staff, which includes all full and part time staff plus regular casuals. The information is based on the obligatory snapshot date of 5th April 2017.  Download Report     HEAD OFFICE CALL 01502 532541, Charity Number 1147896
