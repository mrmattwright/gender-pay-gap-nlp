Recruitment and promotion to positions within the College is on the basis of merit alone. Recruitment is carried out in an open and fair way, and adheres to best practice standards within the sector.  Robert Gordon’s College does not normally award bonuses to staff or others associated with the College.  The infographic below shows the overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2017. It also sets out the gender pay distribution at Robert Gordon’s College by analysing the workforce pay rates into quartiles.  As of the snapshot date, a total of 239 female staff and 112 male staff were considered to be “relevant employees”.  The College is confident that women and men are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across the College.  Our aim is to manage the gender pay gap across the College by continuing to ensure that pay is based on job role and not the individual, by reviewing pay rates for different roles to ensure parity between comparable roles, and through maintaining due diligence on pay awards for senior staff.  I confirm that the data reported is accurate.
