2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

Vaultex UK Ltd is committed to promoting equal opportunities in all areas of recruitment, employment, 
training and promotion. We recognise the importance of diversity and investing in people, which is 
why we place a key focus on providing development opportunities and ongoing internal and external 
training. 

Equality is supported with fair pay and at Vaultex we are extremely dedicated to ensuring that we 
remain Living Wage accredited. Each of our roles are benchmarked according to a fair and unbiased 
grading structure and while we are confident that men and women are paid equally for the same job, 
the greater proportion of men to women in senior roles has created a gender pay gap. Overall we have a 
52/48 percentage male to female split across the organisation. However, the majority our higher grade, 
highly technical skilled roles in sectors such as IT and Change are fulfilled by males as there is a lack of 
women currently in this industry.

Vaultex will continue to tackle the disproportion of pay through offering flexible working, delivering and 
providing continued training prospects and practicing a comprehensive recruitment process.

The gender pay gap displays the difference between hourly rates of pay that men and women receive, as a mean and median 
calculation. 

The difference between average hourly pay between males and females is the mean pay gap. The median pay gap is calculated by 
sorting hourly pay from lowest to highest and finding the midpoint, for both males and females.

The proportion of Males and Females 
who fall within four pay quartile bands.

This helps to understand where women are 
concentrated in terms of their remuneration.

Ways in which we are addressing the gender pay gap

Recruitment and Selection

Employee Retention

Vaultex is an Equal Opportunities employer and welcomes 
applications from the full spectrum of the community. Any 
potential candidates are assessed according to their skills, 
experience and suitability to do the job, rather than based on 
any protected characteristic – such as gender.

We want our employees to want to enjoy their time at work, but 
equally we want them to have a positive work life balance. With 
that being said, we offer a range of benefits for our employees 
such as a flexible working policy, enhanced maternity pay and 
shared parental leave.

Training and Development

Our Responsibility

We are in the process of adding a module to all of our 
employee’s training plans based on Diversity and Inclusion. This 
will be mandatory for all to complete in order for our employees 
to gain more insight and a better understanding of Diversity and 
Inclusion. 

We want to encourage females to want to study and train in male 
dominated sectors such as IT and technology. Our plan this year 
is to carry out visits to schools to empower girls to want to study 
and fulfil roles with an IT or technical focus.

Vaultex is dedicated to ensuring that all of our stakeholders recognise the importance of addressing the Gender Pay Gap and in hand 
promoting ways whereby equality is key.

Going forward, it is our purpose to continue to minimise the inequality of pay and to build a workforce where Diversity and Inclusion 
remain a significant focus.
