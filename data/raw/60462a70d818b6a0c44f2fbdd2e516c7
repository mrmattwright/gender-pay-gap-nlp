SOFTCAT GENDER 
PAY GAP REPORT

AN INTRODUCTION

The gender pay gap reporting 
requirements have helped 
bring gender diversity to 
the forefront of our people 
agenda at Softcat.

The gender pay gap reporting requirements have helped bring gender 
diversity to the forefront of our people agenda at Softcat. We want 
to use the report as a springboard to positively affect our gender pay 
gap and provoke change within our business. This report outlines 
where we are in our journey and what we will be doing to improve.

Martin Hellawell, CEO 

Rebecca Monk, HR Director

The Board remains committed 
to making Softcat as inclusive 
a place to work as possible.

Softcat has progress to make on the gender pay gap and the wider 
issue of gender diversity. We are aware that it will not be an easy task 
due to the nature of our industry, but as I embark on my journey as 
Chairman, I will ensure that the Board remains committed to making 
Softcat as inclusive a place to work as possible. This is both the right 
thing to do and an essential business goal to attract a wider pool of 
talent into the organisation to fulfil our future growth ambitions.  
We have a clear focus on increasing the number of women in senior 
roles and across the entire business, fuelling our drive to reduce the 
gender pay gap over time.

UNDERSTANDING  
THE FIGURES

Softcat has always approached business growth organically and  
we pride ourselves on developing our people from the ground up.  
We hire the majority of our workforce at graduate and entry-level, 
winning multiple awards for our apprentice programme. Most of 
our roles are in sales or technical areas and we know from our own 
experience, as well as industry research, that typically more men seek 
out these types of roles. Softcat’s overall gender balance currently 
stands at 71% male and 29% female, compared to the IT industry 
norm of 17% female (Chartered Institute of IT: Diversity Report).

SOFTCAT GENDER BALANCE 2017

A female has been 
the top performing 
salesperson of  
the year on  
3 occasions in 
the last 10 years

Outside of the senior leadership team, which we recognise is too  
male-oriented, the highest earners in the company are in sales roles, 
where the largest part of their compensation is based on commission. 
During the last ten years, a female has been the top performing 
salesperson of the year on three occasions. Individual sales 
performance is typically linked to tenure, whereby earnings increase 
significantly each year. It is therefore our goal to see an increase in 
the tenure and overall number of females in the upper quartile of 
sales performers.

Our technical and services departments comprise billable consultants 
and technical architects, who are highly accredited in technical 
areas. There is a recognised skills shortage in the industry for these 
employees. The vast majority of applicants for these roles are male.

THE ACTIONS 
WE’RE TAKING 
TO CLOSE  
THE GAP

The figures show that there is work to be done in reducing our pay 
gap. We are examining the structure of our workforce and how we 
can bring more women into entry-level, management and senior 
management roles. As a large recruiter within both our industry  
and local communities, we want to play our part in closing the gap.  
We believe it is imperative for the business to have a larger 
proportion of females across all levels of our company, but  
specifically in senior positions. We will proactively nurture female 
talent, encourage more females to apply for more senior roles and 
in our efforts to provide a more balanced senior team, will look 
favourably on female applicants in the selection process.

WE WILL FOCUS ON ATTRACTING, 
DEVELOPING AND ENABLING OUR 
FEMALE WORKFORCE TO SUCCEED IN 
THE FOLLOWING WAYS:

BRINGING IN  
DIVERSE TALENT

Expand our recruitment 

communications to encourage more 

female applicants in sales and 

technical roles. Extend our current 

awareness campaigns, which include 
entering the Women in Sales awards.

PROGRESSING  
FEMALE TALENT

Take gender into consideration in 
succession planning activities,  
ensuring women are included 
on Leadership and Management 

Development programmes.  

Include diversity awareness in leadership 

and management training modules. 
Support our female employees with 
internal and external female mentors.

HELPING WOMEN  
RETURN TO WORK

Coaching to women before, during 
and after maternity leave to retain 
talent in our business, including 
assignment of a ‘buddy’ who has  
been through the same journey.  
More roles to be available with  
flexible or home-working as an 

option and managers trained on the 

importance of flexibility.

SOFTCAT MUMS 
AND DADS

We have introduced a new networking 
group for Softcat parents, providing 

a buddy scheme, relevant talks 

and information sharing. We have 

reviewed and upgraded our maternity 
and flexible work policies to a similar 

offering to comparable FTSE 250 

companies to retain female employees.

SOFTCAT WOMEN  
IN BUSINESS

We have reignited our female 

networking group. We will continue to 
invite internal and external speakers. 
Promote success stories of female role 

models. Taking place annually on 

March 8th, International Women’s Day 
includes Q&As with senior employees 

and sharing content from other 

industries and companies.

NURTURING FUTURE 
GENERATIONS 
We will consider introducing Bring 

Your Child to Work Day to encourage 

younger people to consider sales 
and technical careers. We will also 

review and look to expand our current 
apprenticeship programme to place 

more focus on opportunities for  

female students.

LOOKING TO THE FUTURE

To achieve our goals, we need to ensure we have programmes and initiatives 
that attract the very best talent at the earliest opportunity, while continuing 
to foster a culture that gives every employee the opportunity to progress and 
succeed. We must aspire to attract future generations of female students into 
sales and STEM careers through work with our partners and engagement with 
our employees and local communities.

We do not see this as a short-term fix and only through years of proactive 
endeavour in this area will we make a significant impact. We are committed to 
doing just that.
