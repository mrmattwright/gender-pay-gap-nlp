The following are just some of the activities we are undertaking to build diversity at our company, supporting SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 15 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions):        In 2017 IHS Markit joined the 30% Club whose signatories commit to the goal of achieving 30% female independent directors on their boards.

An ally can be anyone who supports the LGBTQ community.
