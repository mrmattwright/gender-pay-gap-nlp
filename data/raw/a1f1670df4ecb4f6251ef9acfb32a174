From 1st April 2014 this legal right of access includes all types of ‘recorded’ information held by associated arm’s length organisations such as Live Borders.  From 1st April 2014 any person who makes a request to Live Borders for information must be provided with it, subject to certain conditions.   PUBLICATION SCHEME  The Act also places an obligation on Live Borders to adopt and maintain a Publication Scheme.  Live Borders has adopted the Scottish Information Commissioner’s Single Model Publication Scheme 2014 in its entirety.  The adoption period runs until 31st May 2018.  To view the Single Model Publication Scheme select the downloadable MPS 2014 PDF  In adopting the Single Model Publication Scheme, Live Borders has produced Guidance to the Publication Scheme which will:  • Allow you to see what is available in relation to each class. • State what charges may be applied. • Explain how to find the information easily. • Provide contact details for enquiries and to get help with accessing the information. • Explain how to request information which has not been published.  Alternatively you can contact us on 01896 661166 to ask for a hard copy of the document to be posted to you.  Live Borders & Freedom of Information  It has always been Live Borders' intention to be open and accountable in respect of its approach to the delivery of services.  In this respect, operation of the Freedom of Information Regime reinforces this approach through the introduction of a formal process for providing information which is not routinely made available.   Making a Request If you are unable to find the information by these means, Live Borders is happy to assist you through Freedom of Information.  To make a request please write to foi@liveborders.org.uk describing the information you are requesting, your name and an address for correspondence.
