We are fully committed to the elimination of unlawful and unfair discrimination and value the differences that a diverse workforce brings to the organisation. We support our supply chain and encourage companies who work with us to have an active commitment to our approach on equality and inclusion.  We want to be the UK’s leading smart infrastructure solutions company. To accomplish this we must be more diverse. It is well proven that diverse teams are more innovative, creative, as well as having greater understanding of customers, including the everyday users of infrastructure.  We have a clear goal to have a workforce that is representative of society.  We are committed to achieving the FTSE 350 target of at least 33% of our senior management positions being filled by women by 2020. We are also committed to the FTSE 250 target to have at least one BAME (Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic) board director by 2024.  We have a strategy that sets out our clear long term goal to have a workforce that is representative of society.

In 2013, we strengthened our commitment by becoming signatories to Opportunity Now’s Project 28-40, a pioneering study into the experiences of women in the workplace. The focus of the study is to gain valuable insight and identify actions aimed at improving the attraction and retention of women.  “If the UK is to have a successful and dynamic economy it is vital that each organisation makes the very best of all its people and the talents they bring."  Kathryn Nawrockyi, Gender Equality Director at Business in the Community        Explore by:                    About us    What we do    Our culture    Solutions    Investors    News    Careers    Suppliers                  Terms & conditions  Privacy policy  Blog terms of use  Contact us  Costeam    © All rights reserved Costain 2015 Costain Group PLC, Registration No. 1393773.
