Gender Pay Gap Report 2017 

2 

Brook Learning Trust is required to  report in its gender pay gap under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific 
Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017. 

The pay gap must be reported on in six different ways: - the mean and median gender pay gaps - the 
mean and median gender bonus gaps - the proportion of men and women who received bonuses - the 
proportion of men and women according to quartile pay bands. 

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average earnings between all men and women in an 
organisation. It is different to equal pay, which is concerned with the difference in actual earnings of men 
and women doing equal work (or work of equal value). 

Gender Pay Gap 

The mean gender pay gap is the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of male full-pay relevant 
employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees. 

The  median gender  pay gap  is  the  difference  between  the median  hourly  rate  of pay  of  male full-pay 
relevant employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees. 

Brook Learning Trust’s Mean Gender Pay Gap is 20%, and Median Gender Pay Gap is 37%.

Gender Pay Gap is 35%.

Supporting Statement 

Brook Learning Trust’s workforce is made up of 69% female and 31% male employees, which is typical 
for the sector. The vast majority of the employees at the lower end of the pay spectrum are female. These 
jobs are very often part-time and term-time only which tend to receive more female applicants than male. 
At the upper end of the pay spectrum there is greater balance between the pay of males and females 
with the majority of senior jobs being filled by female employees.   

When analysed broadly into role types (teachers and support staff), the pay gap becomes much smaller 
at 1% for teachers and 10% for support staff, as illustrated in the table below.
