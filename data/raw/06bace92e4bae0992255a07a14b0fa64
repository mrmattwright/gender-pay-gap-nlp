2017 Gender Pay Gap Report 

 

 
Introduction 
 
As an organisation employing more than 250 members of staff, we are now required by law to 
publish our gender pay gap. We have to publish the gap on both a median basis (pay per hour 
based on the person "in the middle" of the distribution of pay) and a mean basis (average hourly 
rate). In addition, we are required to disclose the distribution of gender by pay quartile, and also 
the percentage of staff receiving bonuses by gender and the gender gap on bonuses. 
 
At the reporting date of 5 April 2017, Murrays Healthcare employed 266 members of staff, of 
which 76.7% were female and 23.3% were male.

Murrays Healthcare is committed to providing equal pay for equal work. Our pay policies and 
practices are designed to ensure equal pay rates for equivalent jobs are in place throughout the 
organisation regardless of gender.

Although we have equal pay for work of equal value, we do have a gender pay gap. The 
analysis of our gender gap figures shows that the gap has arisen because of the unequal 
distribution of men and women across the company, particularly in the middle two quartiles, and 
not because of our pay policies and practices. 
 
I confirm that the Gender Pay Gap figures reported are accurate and have been calculated in 
accordance with the regulations set out in the gender pay gap reporting legislation. We are not 
aware of any errors that would materially affect the figures published in this report.
