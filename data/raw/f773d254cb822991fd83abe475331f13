The Trust's gender pay gap information has been obtained from the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) standard reports that were nationally produced to ensure the NHS meet their gender pay gap reporting requirements. The reporting period for our gender pay gap data is as at 31 March 2017.  The Trust welcomes the introduction of gender pay gap reporting as it provides greater pay transparency and is an opportunity for us to review our own gender pay gap information and benchmark ourselves against similar NHS organisations.  The report details the Trust's gender pay gap information as at 31st March 2017 and this information highlights there is a gender pay gap within the Trust. An action plan in response to this data will be developed and form part of the Trusts Equality Delivery system action plan. Progress will be reported to the Inclusion & Diversity Steering Group and each year onwards we will be required to publish our data on the Government website and the Trust's website.
