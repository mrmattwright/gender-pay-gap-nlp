Maureen LeConte, Equipment Manager, Independent Living Centre  More from our clients »    Clients          Welcome to Extrastaff   At Extrastaff our aim is to be the number one national high street recruiter dealing with temporary driving and industrial personnel. All our workers are interviewed face to face and we have 22 locations across the UK. With 85% staff retention, we’ve won numerous awards and achieved a two star ‘Outstanding’ recognition in Best Companies to Work for in 2018.      Find Staff  Find Branches  Find Jobs          Extrastaff was formed in 2003 with the aim of creating a national high quality, high street brand in blue collar recruitment. At conception there was no recognisable shop-fronted high street blue collar brand. There were many nationals dealing with a mix of industrial and secretarial but predominantly, the logistics and industrial specialists – pure specialists – were local agencies. Since inception we have opened 21 locations, won numerous awards and have one of the lowest internal staff turnover figures in the industry. From that 2003 standing start turnover for current year is expected to top £36m dealing exclusively with the logistics and industrial sectors. Our high quality ethos and service has meant that sales have grown organically (ie. without buying any other businesses) year on year with a compound annual growth rate of 60%.   Extrastaff was shortlisted as Best Temporary Recruitment Agency in the 2011 Recruiter Awards and has previously won the award for the Best Logistics Recruitment Firm in the 2009 Recruiter Awards as well as being shortlisted for Best Back Office Support Team. Recruiter Magazine has listed Extrastaff for the last three years in their FAST 50 collection of fastest growing UK recruitment businesses in the UK- currently 44th out of about 16,000. In 2005 Extrastaff won the Recruiter Award for Best Regional Recruitment Firm for London and the South East. In 2016 and 2017 we featured in Recruiter’s Hot 100 and we have been awarded the Best Companies 2 Star Award ‘Outstanding’ in 2017 and 2018.
