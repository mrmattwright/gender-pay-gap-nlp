Moneypenny staff are paid equally for equivalent roles across the business, regardless of gender. PAs represent 75% of our workforce and are predominantly female, earning on average 9.5% more than male colleagues (men hold fewer management roles). Notable department exceptions are; Sales (84% female) 17.80% more than males, IT (67% males) 40.9% more than females, and Senior Management (60% females) 26.2% more than males. This results in an average pay gap as a mean average of 34.80%, 38.3% as a median average. If we disregard our IT team from the calculations, women earn on average slightly more than men, with the median gender pay gap being less than 2%.  Legislation also requires that we publish bonus figure variations. When presented as a percentage, the results could wrongly be perceived as women receiving vastly higher bonuses than men. Whilst 94% of men and 95% of women receive a degree of bonus incentive, Moneypenny Sales Department (86% female) form the majority of this figure. Females receive a mean average 8.6% more than men, but men receive a median average 22.10% more than females.  When dividing the staff into quartiles, 77% of the upper, 98% of the upper middle, 93% of the lower middle and 96% of the lower quartile are female.
