UK Gender 
Pay Gap Statement

Our commitment:
Acuris is committed to equal opportunities in the workplace. We aim to 
create an inclusive environment in which everyone feels able to reach their 
potential based on individual merit and contribution.

Why is there a gap?
We believe that our gender pay gap is the result of a higher proportion 
of males (70%) in management positions, this can be seen in the graph 
opposite ‘Gender pay proportion by pay group.’

We regularly review compensation across the group and are confident that 
males and females receive equal pay for equivalent roles.

Actions we are taking:
• Management appointments: We run development programmes, including 
mentoring and “job tasters”, which are available to all employees and aim 
to broaden the opportunities available to everyone at Acuris.

• Compensation: We will continue to monitor compensation for  

gender equality.

• Recruitment: We already aim to have gender balanced selection panels for 

recruitment decisions and will continue this practice.

• Flexibility: Acuris also offers flexible working practices. In a recent global 

focus group, our people said the workplace flexibility we offered is one of 
the defining characteristics of our culture. We are proud of this and aim to 
strengthen it in the coming year.

We confirm the data reported is accurate. Jonathan Gomer, CFO
