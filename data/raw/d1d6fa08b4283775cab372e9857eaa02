STATEMENT

So what’s behind our numbers?
As has been reported, the UK gender pay gap (GPG) reporting is only one of many ways used to calculate gender pay 
equality. The GPG calculation is not about equal pay; it is simply the difference between female and male average 
earnings across an organization. It does not take into account calculations for employees who hold similar jobs, have 
the same experience, have similar tenure and live in the same geographic area. Rather, the GPG is the difference 
between the hourly pay of all female employees compared to the hourly pay of all male employees. 

Contributing factors for AT&T’s numbers include that AT&T is a technology company, and technical jobs, which are 
typically higher paid, have traditionally attracted more males than females. 

And AT&T in the UK has lower-than-average attrition rates, and above-average tenure for both females and males 
(with average male tenure being longer), compared to national averages. This reflects a strength – that AT&T is a 
great place to work – however, it may reduce the frequency of vacancies,  job changes or promotions.

There are fewer female employees in our sales teams, which are compensated, in part, on commissions.

And 78% of part-time workers at AT&T are female, where GPG bonus calculations do not take account of hours worked. 

However, there is little difference in the percentage of females and males that received a bonus, which for both is very 
close to 100%.
