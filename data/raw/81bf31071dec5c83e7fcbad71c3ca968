Doncaster Council is committed to ensuring that high-quality, customer focused services are delivered in the Borough. Doncaster is a diverse area, where people from many different backgrounds and cultures live, work and visit.  Most people in Doncaster want to live in a community where they know their neighbour, feel safe and have the opportunities to achieve their potential, regardless of their background, their circumstances, or where they live. Our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Framework sets out in one place our EDI objectives and arrangements for embedding equality into everything we do. It outlines our commitment to EDI, and links directly to the strategic ambitions set out in the ‘Doncaster Growing Together’ (DGT) prospectus, our plan for the Borough.
