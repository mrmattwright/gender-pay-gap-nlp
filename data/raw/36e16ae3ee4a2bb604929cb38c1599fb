Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve introduced a number of strategies to reduce the gender pay gap and focus on career development for females in the workplace. Weâ€™re offering dedicated mentoring and coaching for our female employees, as well as discussion groups around women in leadership and maternity career coaching. Plus, weâ€™re placing an intentional focus on recruiting and developing women into more senior roles. View our gender pay gap report 2017-18 below.
