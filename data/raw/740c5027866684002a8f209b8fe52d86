GENDER PAY REPORT 2017 

 

Foreword by David Caton, ONR’s Human Resources Director 

 
 
To achieve our strategic objectives, ONR needs an engaged, capable and diverse 
workforce that feels valued and is committed to ONR’s goals. We understand that 
key to this is establishing a culture where our people feel proud to work for us and 
that they are all valued for their personal contribution regardless of role.  
 
We understand that as ONR takes steps to establish its own culture, with a 
particular focus in improving its diversity and inclusivity, how we recognise and 
reward the contribution of all is an important element of that.  
 
This report is seen as an important focus and catalyst to helping us understand 
and address some of the issues in making that change.  We have already begun to 
identify and tackle concerns that this report highlights and are fully committed, 
including at Board and Executive Management Team level, to continue to take 
action and report on our progress. 
 
The report highlights the degree of challenge that we face, but we remain resolute 
in our desire to work tirelessly to continuously improve to be able to meet those 
challenges.

OFFICE FOR NUCLEAR REGULATION  

GENDER PAY REPORT 2017 

This is the Office for Nuclear Regulation’s (ONR) first Gender Pay Report.   
 
It is based on a “snapshot” of the pay of all ONR employees as at 31 March 2017, as 
well as annual payments and bonuses which were paid between 1 April 2016 and 31 
March 2017. 
   
The report has been produced in line the guidance in the Equalities Act 2010 and 
associated ACAS guidance “Managing gender pay reporting”, 2017. 
 
Why do we have to report on our gender pay gap? 

The Equalities Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) came into force on 6 
April 2017 and requires public sector organisations to publish their results against six 
prescribed indicators of gender pay equality.   

As an organisation we should be interested in this information as we strive to build 
greater equality across a more diverse and inclusive workforce.  This is in line with our 
People Strategy and our aim of making ONR a great place to work and to be expected 
of us as a world class regulator.   

This report helps us to better understand and focus on the issues, holding ourselves to 
account as we plan actions to improve on our current position.   

What do we have to report about our gender pay gap? 

We need to report against six prescribed organisation-wide indicators, as do all other 
public sector organisations employing more than 250 people, to show the difference 
between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation.  We have 
included additional information in this report to provide a broader context in 
understanding the organisation in relation to the gender pay gap. 

When and how do we have to publish the information? 

We are publishing ONR’s gender pay gap results through this report.  This report 
contains background context to the results as well plans to address issues relating to 
the gender pay gap moving forward. 
 
The ONR organisation-wide prescribed gender pay gap indicators have also been 
uploaded to the designated government website about the gender pay gap. 
 
What do we have to report?  

The legislation requires ONR to report the following 6 prescribed organisation-wide 
gender pay gap indicators for 2017:

Overall results 
 
These organisation-wide results show that ONR has a mean gender pay gap of 
32.94%.  This is not dissimilar to the rest of the UK nuclear industry, and to be 
expected given ONR’s workforce profile (and that of the industry from which we 
recruit).   
 
Within ONR, the majority of men are employed at higher grading levels in technical 
specialist roles, for which a pay premium is required to attract new employees in a 
difficult recruitment market.  Most women are employed at lower grading levels in 
support roles (corporate and operational), and are also more likely to work part-time 
(which is factored into these results).  This gender split is largely structural as for many 
years ONR has recruited its technical specialists in the higher grades from an 
education system and nuclear industry where men predominated in the Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects.   
 
Further breakdown of the results 
 
A further breakdown of the ONR data for 2017 shows that across specific peer groups 
(grading level and specialism), the gender pay gap is far less pronounced.

Table 1: ONR number of men and women employed at each grading level as at 

31 March 2017 

 
Overall, ONR employs a higher percentage of men (68%) than women (32%).  The 
proportion of men employed is significantly greater (15% or more higher than women) 
in the higher grades (Bands 1 – 3 and SCS 1 levels).   
 
Women strongly predominate in the lower grades (Bands 4 – 6).  Significantly 
however, there are an equal number of men and women in the most senior 
grades/roles (SCS 2 and Non-Executives).

Note: columns showing results for SCS 2 and Assurance and Risk Assessment Committee Non-Executive have been excluded 
due to identifiable data.  The data is included in the ONR total results. 
 
Whilst the overall mean gender pay gap is significant at 32.94%, the breakdown for 
each grading level shows a more positive story. 
 
At the Senior Civil Service (SCS) 1 level and for Board Members, the gender pay gap 
is negligible or even in favour of women with a range of 0.02% – minus 14.14%. All of 
these roles have been filled since ONR was established in April 2014 and reflect a 
positive approach to demonstrating pay equality in the most senior roles in the 
organisation. 
 
For ONR’s senior and middle managers (Bands 1 – 3) in nuclear technical specialist 
or for corporate support in functional specialist roles – most of which tend to attract a 
pay premium on recruitment, the widest gender pay gap is seen (between 8 and 12%).  
However, this is still significantly below the gap recorded for the organisation as a 
whole.   
 
The split of men and women at the junior management level (Band 4) is fairly even at 
5.29%.  Here there is also a fairly even mix of technical specialist, corporate and 
operational support roles (with the latter not attracting a pay premium for specific 
specialist skills or qualifications on joining ONR).  
 
Women are predominantly employed in ONR’s lower paid bands (Bands 5 and 6), 
where there are a mix of corporate and operational support roles, neither of which 
require specific specialist skills or qualifications on joining ONR, or as a career role.  
The gap is minimal or in favour of women in the range 5.29% – minus 0.26%).

The overall median gender pay gap is significant at 55.25%, but again the breakdown 
for each grading level is more positive.  The gap at each grading level may be 
explained by men being in the majority with longer service in the grade and historic 
progression up the pay range.

Table 4:  ONR number of men and women by specialism and grading level as at 

 
For technical specialist roles, the number of women is low (20% or less) in all areas, 
and there is a need to improve the representation of women.   
 
In the support roles, the proportion of women employees is reasonably equal to, or in 
favour of, women compared with men (rated green), and is not in itself an area for 
particular concern.

Table 5 shows recruitment patterns since April 2014.  Although in 2017/18 year so far, 
there has been shift towards recruiting a higher proportion of women.  However, over 
the previous 3 years, women were a lower proportion of the intake of new starters and 
this will inevitably continue under-representation of women employed in the 
organisation in future years.

Table 6:  ONR 2017 mean gender pay gap by specialism 

 
In terms of the mean gender pay gap across the specialism groups, the gap between 
men and women technical specialists is low – which is very positive.  However, there 
is a significant gap between men and women in support roles and whilst men are 
proportionately less well-represented than women.  This is largely explained by the 
fact that more women (45%) in support roles work part-time than men (7%). 
 
What else do we need to do? 
 
This report is just the start. It is helpful in presenting an analysis of the organisation in 
relation to gender pay issues and for highlighting where we may wish to focus 
attention in order to better understand and address areas of concern. It is a further tool 
in our wider approach to identifying and tackling areas of diversity and inclusion 
across the organisation.  However, we recognise that there are few quick wins.  This 
gender pay analysis indicates that many of the factors are structural and our strategy 
(running alongside that of the nuclear industry from which ONR necessarily draws 
most of its resource) is to see an improvement in the longer term, over the next 5 – 10 
years or even longer.   
 
The bottom line has to be getting more women into technical specialist roles and more 
senior jobs going forward.  This will largely be done by continuing to support the 
recruitment pipeline and develop improved talent pipelines which will help us to make 
this happen. 
 
What are we doing to close the gender pay gap? 
 
We recognise, as reflected above, that the significantly higher proportion of men within 
our more highly paid technical specialist cadre results in a material gender pay gap on 
the basis of the required reporting methodology. We also recognise that the greater 
ratio of men in our higher grades is also reflected in the gender pay gap analysis. As 
an organisation, we have already acknowledged that a diverse workforce, that is more 
representative of the society on behalf of which we hold the industry to account, is key 
to achieving our strategic aims and being a world class regulator.  
 
We are therefore committed in our strategies and plans to improve our diversity at all 
levels. Being successful in addressing these diversity issues will impact directly on 
addressing the issues that the gender pay analysis has highlighted. The work we have 
been doing recently to support this is outlined below:  
 
Improving representation of women in our workforce 
 
To close the current gender pay gap (and improve our diversity more generally) we 
will need to continue to improve our ability to attract females into the higher paid 
nuclear specialist and higher band roles.  Our recruitment strategy aims to achieve 
this through a number of activities:  

Office for Nuclear Regulation 

 

Page 8 of 11 

Office for Nuclear Regulation Gender Pay Report 2017 

  Promoting ONR to others - In the last year, we have focused our recruitment 

campaigns and websites on demonstrating diversity of opportunities at all levels 
and specialisms for diverse candidates e.g. we have developed “YouTube” 
style video clips on our website which feature women role models including 
those in senior leadership roles. 
 

  We are also engaging externally with organisations such as Women in Nuclear 

(our Chief Executive, Adriènne Kelbie is patron) and Powerful Women to 
increase our profile and explore further approaches to increasing ONR as an 
employer of choice across genders.  
 

  Selection arrangements – In 2016, we introduced “name-anonymous” selection 
in our recruitment process, in a move to remove unconscious bias at that early 
stage.  All selection panels (for external or internal recruitment) have a female 
panel member as far as practically possible.  All selection panels have a HR 
professional involved as a panel member or advisor. 
 

  Senior leadership roles - We are proud of the fact that our Chief Executive, 

recruited from outside the organisation in 2016, is a woman.  Our Board is now 
equally split by gender and we have significantly increased the number of 
women on our top management teams. 
 

  Nucleargraduates scheme - Since 2014, ONR has sponsored an annual cohort 

of around 8 individuals participating in the industry-wide “nucleargraduates” 
graduate training programme, and further cohort will start in autumn 2017.  
Nearly 50% of the ONR sponsored participants have been women, and we are 
very pleased that so far 9 women have subsequently joined ONR as technical 
specialists on permanent appointments or plan to do so when their current 
programme ends in October 2017. 

 
Starting young – our support for STEM activity 
 

  We know that ONR staff can play a vital role in inspiring future generations of 

women engineers and scientists, both through our work within ONR or by 
supporting other bodies with which we’re proud to be connected.  In relation to 
gender equality, ONR actively supports staff who wish to volunteer as Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) Ambassadors getting involved in a 
range of activities which can have an impact on young people’s learning and 
enjoyment of STEM subjects by providing a living example of how STEM 
subjects can lead to interesting, successful and rewarding careers.  Our staff 
have been active in the local community giving careers talks or helping at 
careers fairs, and providing technical advice or practical support to STEM 
projects in the classroom.  We have also hosted a number of school-aged 
children undertaking a period of work experience in the organisation. 

  We will continue to engage with schools, colleges and universities as part of 

encouraging take up of STEM subjects by all genders and seek to attract more 
female applications into the industry and potentially ONR.

Developing our women 
 

  We were pleased to see 4 women promoted to Band 2 nuclear specialist roles 

in 2017.  We found that 12% of applicants were women, 80% of whom were 
successful, compared to 75% of men who applied.  A lessons-learned exercise 
will be conducted shortly and will include an examination of any emerging 
equality issues.  Of the remaining 27 women Band 3 nuclear specialists, 14 
joined the organisation in 2015 or later.  These individuals will be developing 
their regulatory knowledge, skills and experience and will hopefully be ready to 
be recommended for promotion in the near future.  
 

  We have had some success in increasing the gender balance within higher 
grades.  The issues around this were the focus of external research that we 
recently commissioned on Women and Leadership to identify experiences and 
barriers that may exist across ONR to inform our leadership development 
approach.  
 

  At the heart of increasing the gender balance at higher grades is ensuring that 
development addresses any inherent barriers and this is one of the key topics 
being considered by the ONR Diversity and Inclusion Group (under the 
governance of our Executive Management Team). This work will input into 
development of our leadership behavioural competence framework and linked 
leadership and management development programmes. 
 

  We are working to achieve the National Equality Standard by September 2018 
and expect to learn a lot from the assessment process about our development 
policy and process.  Working with our Diversity and Inclusion Group (DIG) we 
plan to address and tackle any barriers identified as part of that assessment. 
 

Flexible working  
 
Often cited as an impediment to better gender balance, our policies on flexible working 
arrangements are consistent with best practice but we recognise that their 
understanding and application is not as consistent as we would want.   
 
We actively encourage take up of our policies to support women with caring 
responsibilities and to achieve a good work/life balance.  This includes opportunities 
to:  

  work from home; 
  adopt alternative working patterns, including compressed hours, part-time 

working, and part year working; 

  make use of wide range of family friendly policies – for those with caring 

responsibilities; 
take partial retirement; 
take paid and unpaid time off to undertake training, studies and voluntary work. 

 
 

 
We will continue to promote actively and positively at all levels in the organisation, and 
this will remain a key focus for manager and staff briefings as well as core 
management development workshops and training.  
 
 
 

Office for Nuclear Regulation

Performance bonuses 
 

  We undertake challenge and analysis at key stages of our performance 

management process including moderation panels at both mid and end year. 
These panels are required to focus on diversity specific issues and we require 
panel chairs and independent HR observers to confirm no evidence of 
conscious or unconscious bias. 
  

  For the next report in 2018, we expect to see a significant reduction in the 

gender gap between bonus values as we have reduced the range of level of 
awards and also used a salary average for the grade. We will also continue to 
focus on ensuring challenge to prevent bias throughout the process. We are 
reviewing our performance system for 2018 onwards and this will include an 
equality assessment for any changes.  

 
Pay 
 

 

In 2017, we introduced competence-based pay progression, providing between 
2 and 4 specified pay steps to achieve pay range maxima.  We expect this to 
have a positive impact on addressing the gender pay gap across grading levels 
given the higher ratio of men already at the top of their respective pay scales (a 
legacy based on length of service that has now been removed). This however 
will have minimal positive impact on the overall pay gap given the continued 
higher proportion of males in the higher pay bands.   
 

  We will be developing a new pay deal from 2018-19 and this will include a 

formal equality impact assessment to identify any potential gender issues and 
seek to address them. 
 

Why should we do this? 
 
The business case for diversity and inclusion is already well known and evidenced. 
From creating a more motivated, engaged and therefore more productive workforce, 
to the positive impact that a more diverse and balanced team has on improved 
decision making and strategic focus for an organisation.  
 
We recognise the benefits of a more gender balanced workforce will help us meet our 
strategic aims, through enhancing our professional knowledge, bringing challenge and 
new perspectives, and providing a working environment in which everyone achieves 
their full potential.  To do this we are positive that ONR must have a culture which 
supports women and their progression to greater levels of representation at more 
senior levels. 
 
ONR is committed to its vision of being an exemplary regulator that inspires respect, 
trust and confidence. We recognise the important obligation we have, on behalf of the 
public, in holding the nuclear industry to account. We do this through our people and 
therefore it is incumbent on us to provide a great workplace and positive culture that 
enables us to get the best out of all our staff. Identifying and addressing diversity 
issues, including those highlighted within this report, are therefore integral to our
