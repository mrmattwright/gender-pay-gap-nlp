Organisations with 250 staff or more are required to publish data about their gender pay gap and update it annually. We welcome gender pay gap reporting as an opportunity to learn and improve.  In 2018, we reported a mean gender pay gap of 11.8 per cent and a median of 8.9 per cent. These are much lower than the anticipated UK national average of 17.4 per cent and 18.9 per cent respectively.  Although this is lower than many organisations, there can be no room for complacency. We are proud of the progress we have already made to close this gap.  Committed to closing the gap  We are committed to doing more and will be implementing a series of actions, including:   announcing improvements to our maternity benefits  enabling more flexible working arrangements  strengthening our training and support offers  looking at how to improve staff retention and progression.   We believe that we have a humanitarian, ethical and legal responsibility to celebrate and champion equality and diversity. Only by doing this can we truly embody our fundamental principles and values.  Our inclusion and diversity strategy for 2017 to 2019 commits us to creating a more dynamic and inclusive British Red Cross. We will benefit from a variety of perspectives to make smarter decisions and better support people in crisis. Gender equality is a significant part of this commitment.
