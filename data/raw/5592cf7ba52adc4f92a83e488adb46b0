As part of this commitment, Salesforce has published its first UK Gender Pay Gap report, based on the criteria established by the UK government.  Salesforce is proud of the action we've taken on equal pay. Two years ago, we made a commitment to ensure equal pay for equal work at Salesforce. Since then, we've conducted two global equal pay assessments, resulting in the company spending approximately $6 million to address any unexplained differences in pay between men and women. And we will continue to monitor and review employee compensation on an ongoing basis.  The findings of Salesforce's UK Gender Pay Gap report reflect Salesforce's having more men than women in leadership roles in the UK. As part of our commitment to Equality, we are actively working to increase the pipeline of women in leadership roles in the UK and throughout the company. Some highlights of our initiatives include:   Our High Potential Leadership Programme aims to identify the future leaders of our business and provide them with additional mentoring and coaching to grow their careers. This programme led to a 37% increase in the number of women promoted in the UK last year.  Salesforce has joined forces with other key industry organisations as a signatory of the Tech Talent Charter which aims to deliver greater diversity in the UK tech workforce.  At the entry level, we’re striving to hire a diverse range of graduates that reflect the diversity of the community we operate in. This year, our FutureForce intake in the UK was 74% female, up from 70% last year.  Engaging leadership and candidates with diversity dashboards, unconscious bias training and an inclusive hiring process.  Building the pipeline of diverse talent coming into the industry through investment and support of STEM education programmes such as Stemettes and School 21.
