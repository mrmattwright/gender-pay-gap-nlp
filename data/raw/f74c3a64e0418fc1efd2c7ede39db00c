Health-on-Line is part of the AXA group and is committed to the principles of equal pay for all our employees. As such we share an absolute commitment to becoming a truly inclusive place to work, where everyone can reach their true potential. We believe that not only is this the right thing to do, but it is vital for the success of our business.  “Whilst far from the full picture, gender pay gap reporting gives the impetus for businesses like AXA to take a cold, hard look at how well we’re doing in levelling the gender playing field. We’re reacting to what this data is telling us and will be restless in our pursuit of gender parity for our employees”  Amanda Blanc Group Chief Executive AXA UK & Ireland   Health-on-Line Gender Pay Gap Report             Share online        Leave a comment   Your Name        Your Email        Your Comment               Extra                         Search         Recent posts   Health-on-Line staff to take on the Bournemouth Bay Run challenge  Health-on-Line Gender Pay Gap Report  Health-on-Line shares the love for annual Charity Valentine’s Raffle  Health-on-Line pledges support to Mind and Macmillan Caring Locally  Health-on-Line staff spread Christmas cheer for charity  Health-on-Line sponsors Bournemouth Christmas Market  Health-on-Line Celebrate the Regions Rising Business Stars  Health insurer to hold recruitment open day  Health on Line wins at national awards for a fourth year running  Insurer proudly recruits 54 new staff  Staff to star in recruitment ads  Health-on-Line staff star in recruitment campaign      Archive   2018 January  Health-on-Line pledges support to Mind and Macmillan Caring Locally  2018 February  Health-on-Line shares the love for annual Charity Valentine’s Raffle  2018 March  Health-on-Line Gender Pay Gap Report  Health-on-Line staff to take on the Bournemouth Bay Run challenge     Archive   2017 March  Staff to star in recruitment ads  2017 May  Insurer proudly recruits 54 new staff  2017 August  Health on Line wins at national awards for a fourth year running  2017 September  Health insurer to hold recruitment open day  2017 October  Health-on-Line Celebrate the Regions Rising Business Stars  Health-on-Line sponsors Bournemouth Christmas Market  2017 December  Health-on-Line staff spread Christmas cheer for charity     Archive   2016 February  Health-on-Line raises £16,000 for Hope for Food  Come for the Challenge at Health-on-Line  2016 March  Health-on-Line touches down on 400 staff  Health-on-Line pledges its support to three Dorset charities  2016 April  Health-on-Line and InsureMe-on-Line awarded national customer service accreditation  2016 July  Your Money Awards 2016  2016 September  Health-on-Line staff star in recruitment campaign     Archive   2015 February  Feefo Award  2015 March  Cycling for Mosaic  2015 April  New Products Launch  2015 May  London Marathon  Superhero Fun Run  2015 July  Dexters score a ride on the Health-on-Line Balloon  Health-on-Line employees serve up strawberries and cream for charity  Local business wins at National awards for a 2nd year running  Health-on-Line named finalist for Employer of the year Award  2015 August  Health-on-Line raises money for charity Mosaic  2015 September  AXA PPP healthcare and Health-on-Line Birthday  2015 October  Health-on-Line IT Team recognized locally at Dorset Business Awards  2015 November  Health-on-Line raises £3,000 for charity  2015 December  Health-on-Line’s IT department named ‘Team of the Year’  Health-on-Line donates to Hope For Food  Living behind a Mask  Health-on-Line staff show off their hideous Christmas jumpers for charity     Archive   2014 October  Pull a Plane for Julia's House  Outrageous Jumper for Julia's House  Health-on-Line Excel in Customer Service  Local Business Wins at National Awards  The Road to Recruitment  Cycle to Work  Time for a New Start?
