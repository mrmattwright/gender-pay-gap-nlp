                  Menu      Log in    Home Page    Leigh Trust Information   Home  About Us  Leigh Trust Information      On the 1 st January 2014 we were successful in creating a Multi Academy Trust (MAT) known as Leigh Trust (a non-profit making charitable company limited by guarantee). As of 1 st January 2014, Leigh Primary school is now an academy within Leigh Trust.    As part of the transfer the secretary of state also approved Leigh Trust "sponsor status".  Meaning Leigh Trust has the potential  to sponsor other local schools and support them to build upon their existing strengths and help them achieve rapid educational transformation . As of the 1st July 2014, Leigh Trust was successful with their application to sponsor Alston Primary School.  Leigh Trust have also been successful with sponsoring another local primary school, (Wyndcliffe Primary School) as of 1st March 2015.    The Trust aims to have all three schools, Leigh Primary , Alston Primary and Wyndcliffe Primary school working in successful partnership and sharing best practice in order to raise educational standards across the Trust.    We look forward to continuing our work with all our communities to ensure our Primary Schools and Leigh Trust goes from strength to strength in providing an outstanding learning community for all our learners.
