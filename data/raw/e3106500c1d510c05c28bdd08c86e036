Gender Pay Gap 
Reporting 

Last Updated: 27th March 2018   

The Mandatory Gender Pay Gap Reporting proposes that organisations should, for the first 
mandatory report, capture data as a snapshot on 5 April 2017 and then publish their 
findings no later than 4 April 2018. This cycle will then continue year on year going forward 
with organisations being required to maintain the data on their websites for three years in 
order to show progress made. 

The gender pay gap shows the differences in the average pay between men and women. If a 
workplace has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may a number of 
issues to deal with, and the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues 
are. In some cases, the gender pay gap may include unlawful inequality in pay but this is not 
necessarily the case. 

The Equality and Human Rights Commission defines the difference between equal pay and 
the gender pay gap as follows: 

1. Equal pay means that men and women in the same employment performing equal work 
must receive equal pay, as set out in the Equality Act 2010. 

2. The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men’s and women’s average 
earnings across an organisation or the labour market. It is expressed as a percentage of 
men’s earnings. 

Salaries at The United Synagogue are determined by evaluating the job role and not the post 
holder. It makes no reference to gender or any other personal characteristics of existing or 
potential job holders. We are confident that The United Synagogue is paying the same salary 
to roles of equal value. 

The United Synagogue has a complex structure with over 60 different job roles, at least 5 of 
which are gender specific due to Halacha (Jewish Law) and include Dayanim (Rabbinic 
Judges, male), Rabbis (male), Rebbetzens (female), Cantors (male) and Reverends (male). 
Amongst the job roles with the highest paying salaries & bonus payments are Dayanim and 
Rabbis. For the purposes of this data it’s important to note that out of the 712 employee 
salaries analysed, 60 (8.4%) fall in to these two job roles. Taking these two points together 
introduces a male bias in many of the higher United Synagogue salaries. 

The data below represents the gender pay gap snapshot data for The United Synagogue as 
at April 2017 and is presented as required by the regulations.
