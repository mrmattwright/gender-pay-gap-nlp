average, more than males.

middle’ of the distribution of pay.

Report - V.Ships UK Ltd

V.Group operates within the maritime sector and employs many colleagues who have had previous seagoing experience. Statistics within
the maritime industry indicate that around 2% of seafarers are women acknowledging that it is traditionally a male-dominated industry. The
majority of females within our organisation therefore tend to be in predominantly administrative roles rather than technical marine related roles.
This has a direct impact on our gender pay gap calculation.

*

V.Group recognises the importance of women in the maritime industry and will continue to look at ways to attract, develop and retain women
into our company in support of addressing the gender pay gap.

On a global basis, V.Group has a gender distribution of 45% female and 55% male. V.Ships UK Ltd distribution is 27% female and 73% male. 
In future years we will take further steps to move towards a more equitable split of male and female colleagues in our UK business, which in 
turn will help close the gender pay gap.
