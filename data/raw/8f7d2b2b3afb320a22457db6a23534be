GOLIN 2018 GENDER
PAY GAP REPORT

Golin is passionate about reducing the gender pay gap and 
creating the most progressive workplace in our industry.

In April 2018 UK businesses employing more than 250 people must publish their gender 
pay gap data. Reporting is not a legal requirement for Golin, but we are publishing our 
gender pay gap as part of our commitment to women and parents in our industry.

At Golin we pride ourselves on creating a culture that allows women to thrive in their 
careers. In the last three years we have encouraged more women to take on senior 
leadership roles in our agency and the wider industry. Our leadership team is now made 
up of 64% women, which is representative of the number of women entering the 
industry at junior levels.
 
Our flexible working policy has helped 100% of our mums return to us from maternity 
leave, our work with the Back2Businessship programme for career break women has 
helped 75 parents get back to work and our industry-leading family policies are helping 
more mums and dads share the care.
 
This action has helped us reach an overall gender pay gap figure that is in favour of 
women, as the majority of people in the most senior roles in the agency are women. 
Gender pay gap reporting is a great opportunity to drive positive change and we will 
continue to our drive gender equality within the agency and the industry.

WHAT WE DO 

Enhanced family friendly benefits
Advertise all roles open to flexibility
A returnship scheme
Partnership with the Fawcett Society
Maternity mentoring

WHAT WE WILL DO 
•  Women’s leadership coaching
•  Drive uptake of SPL
•  Unconscious bias training 

I confirm the data reported is accurate.
