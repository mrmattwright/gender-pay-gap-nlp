Rick Willmott, Group Chief Executive, Willmott Dixon  The ability of people from all backgrounds to thrive and enjoy rewarding careers with us is very important for our success. We want the construction industry to attract equal numbers of men and women in what we believe is the best sector to work in!  To ensure we benefit from the skills and talent available in all sections of society, our aim is to have gender parity in our workforce by 2030.

As part of this, we recently launched a gender diversity steering group and local action groups, in order to address the gender balance within our company and industry. This involves a cross section of the business working with senior management on ideas and initiatives that make our company a destination for people keen to make their mark and live and enjoy a work/life balance.  We're proud of the career openings we provide - see vlogs from Isla , Beth and Simone on their trainee experiences.
