We are committed to taking positive steps to ensure fair and equitable access to services for all. As a major provider of services, we need to be pro-active so that we can meet the changing needs of diverse communities, and provide fair access for all in an environment where dignity, equality, diversity and human rights are respected and promoted. C&I recognises that everyone is different, and values the unique contribution that individual experiences, knowledge and skills make in delivering quality healthcareand becoming a model employer. We aim to make sure our services respect your human rights, and are fair and reflective of local needs. Our staff and patients are all different. We want to make sure our services and employment practices respect, promote and celebrate these differences, be they in relation to age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. We are committed to going beyond our the legal requirements by ensuring we make equality, diversity and human rights integral to all of our decisions.  We are therefore implementing the Equality Diversity System (EDS) as agreed by the NHS Equality and Diversity Council (EDC) and the Department of Health and have also published our Workforce Race Equality (WRES) Report. The EDS will become part of the system architecture of the NHS and NHS commissioners and providers will be issued with a set of Equality Objectives and Outcomes, against which each NHS organisation will analyse and grade its performance.. To make sure we promote equality and human rights we set up  events, write a yearly report on Equality and use a tool called Equality Impact Analysis (EQIA) to analyse and review services and policies to ensure there is no unjustifiable adverse impact on the people we look after.
