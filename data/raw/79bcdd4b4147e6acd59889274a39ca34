Considering our wider working environment, we have many initiatives that encourage a diverse workforce.  These include established flexible working practices that many of our colleagues participate in, support for working families and encouraging internal promotions.   In addition we regularly review all employees’ pay against our robust salary framework to ensure all role holders are paid fairly for comparable roles, regardless of gender.  I declare that our data has been calculated according to the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
