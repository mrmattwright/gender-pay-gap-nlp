Welcome to the ELCAP website. ELCAP works in the Lothians for people who need support to enjoy meaningful and fulfilling lives. We support people in the ways they prefer so they can live the kind of lives they want.  Most of our work is for adults with lifelong disabilities but we also support people with life-limiting conditions and families caring for a child with significant support needs. ELCAP is a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee.   " I fully support and endorse the work of ELCAP because for over 25 years they have effectively served thousands of people with disabilities throughout East Lothian,  Midlothian and Edinburgh with the highest quality of professional care.  Their level of care has  been further confirmed by the Care Inspectorate who recently awarded them their highest scores.  Furthermore, ELCAP is an exemplary employer of over 300 highly skilled and dedicated people who compassionately care for their service users.  They have received numerous positive evaluations for the high level of training and the overall quality of care their staff provide to currently over 150 persons.  In my opinion, ELCAP is one of Scotland's greatest success stories and therefore they carry my highest and best recommendation and support for the important work they do in our community and far beyond."
