Close Brothers Group plc Gender pay gap 2017 to 2018 reporting year

Welcome to our gender pay gap report

We are confident that men and 
women are paid equally for 
performing equivalent roles across our 
business, and are committed to taking 
all steps possible to reduce our gender 
pay gap. We are pleased that our 
employees feel that we are inclusive – 
in our 2017 Employee Opinion Survey, 
90% of males and females agreed that 
their division treats employees fairly 
regardless of their gender or ethnicity.  

When looking at the gender pay gap 
figures, it is important to note that 
they are distinct from equal pay. The 
latter focuses on the equality of pay 
between genders for staff performing 
at similar levels and roles, whereas 
gender pay gap focuses attention on 
the absolute gap, generally driven by 
a greater proportion of males in senior 
and front office roles where market 
rates are higher. 

We already exceed the Government’s 
target of 33% of Board members 
being women, and are in line with the 
Hampton-Alexander gender targets 
for executives and their direct reports. 
However, we know there is far more  
to be done to improve our female 
talent pipeline at all levels of our  
business, and have made a number  
of commitments in order to drive  
forward change.

Whilst we are committed to improving 
gender balance, our ambitions 
around inclusion are much broader. 
We have recently joined Stonewall, a 
leading LGBTQ+ rights charity, and 
the Employers Network for Equality 
and Inclusion (ENEI) to help shape our 
thinking and activities in the diversity 
and inclusion sphere.

Preben Prebensen, Chief Executive

We are passionate about fairness and 
equality, and are committed to creating 
an environment that allows all our 
employees to feel proud to work for us, 
regardless of their gender, age, race, 
ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation  
or background.

What are we doing to improve 

diversity 

inclusion?

 and

Our progress so far

Over the past few years we have been focusing on improving diversity at all levels 
through a number of initiatives. Outlined below are some of the steps we have  
taken to promote gender balance throughout the Group and provide an inclusive  
environment for all our colleagues. 

Tackling unconscious bias

 We have developed unconscious bias 
training for all managers, highlighting 
the need to recognise how our 
subconscious impacts the decisions 
we make.

Partnership with leading 
diversity organisations

We partner with three leading 
organisations to inform our thinking 
and promote inclusion throughout  
our businesses.

 In order to make it as impactful  
as possible, we made sure it is  
face-to-face rather than via e-learn.

•  30% Club is an institution focused 

on promoting good gender balance 
within companies at all levels.

Gender balanced benefits

 We offer a range of family friendly 
benefits aimed at making it easier to 
balance work and life as a parent.

 We have introduced the same 
enhanced parental leave to all new 
parents, and provide emergency 
backup care for children and  
elderly relations.

 All employees at all levels are entitled 
to request flexible working.

•  Stonewall is Europe’s largest 

LGBTQ charity supporting 
individuals and employers.

•  The Employer’s Network for Equality 

and Inclusion is the UK’s leading 
employer network covering all 
aspects of equality and inclusion  
in the workplace

Inclusive recruitment  
strategies

We aim for a 50:50 gender split in our 
Aspire school leaver and Graduate 
programmes.

We run a ‘Future Female Talent’ event 
to help attract talented females to our 
Graduate programme. Last year this 
provided 13% of total hires.

Driving awareness  
and accountability at  
senior levels

 We have developed a dashboard 
of key diversity statistics which are 
provided to business leaders on a 
monthly basis. These can be broken 
down to show gender balance within 
each individual business.

 Inclusion is now a regular agenda  
item at Executive Committee 
meetings to ensure we are delivering 
on our commitments.

Mentoring and leadership 
programmes

 We offer a range of mentoring and 
leadership programmes across our 
different businesses, designed to 
foster female talent and drive internal 
promotions.

We participate in the leading 30% 
Club cross-company mentoring 
scheme, with 23 of our talented 
females currently taking part.

Stepping up our efforts

Over the next year, we plan to take further action to tackle the gender pay gap and 
build a diverse talent pipeline through a number of initiatives and commitments.  
We want to ensure we are fostering a culture of meritocracy and inclusion where 
everyone has an equal opportunity to develop and progress.

Improving opportunities for 
women in sales

Enhancing our inclusive 
recruitment strategies

Introducing everyday  
flexible working

Our Asset Finance Sales Academy 
will run for the second time in 2018, 
with a primary focus on improving our 
female representation in sales.

The programme aims to develop our 
next generation of Sales Managers 
through classroom-based training, job 
shadowing and regular coaching from 
senior mentors.

For all entry level programmes,  
we now have an explicit objective  
to seek a 50:50 gender balance  
split, and a mandate to seek  
ethnic diversity.

For our senior roles, we insist that 
search agencies provide us with a 
diverse shortlist of candidates.

Helping women return  
to work

 We are making sure that colleagues 
who go on maternity leave are set up 
for success and supported in their 
return to work by upskilling our line 
managers.

We have been trialling returnships  
in order to help talented females 
return to the workplace after an 
extended absence. 

Improving our gender  
balance at senior levels 

We aim over the medium term to 
improve our representation of Senior 
Managers to 30%, to fall in line with 
our Board representation. 

We will particularly focus on improving 
the gender balance in our senior 
front office roles, where female 
representation tends to be lower.

We embrace flexible working 
wherever possible throughout all  
our businesses.

 In order to embed this further, we are 
working to promote the advantages 
of everyday flexibility to allow all our 
employees to balance their work and 
home lives effectively.

 Our line managers will be given 
enhanced guidance on flexible 
working, highlighting the importance 
and benefits of providing flexibility to 
their teams.

Supporting social  
mobility through  
UpReach internships

We are passionate about social 
mobility and creating an organisation 
with equal opportunities for all, 
regardless of background. 

For the first time this year we will  
be working with UpReach to launch  
an internship programme for 
undergraduates from less-advantaged 
backgrounds.

Our gender pay gap

figures

We are confident that men and women are 
paid equally for performing equivalent roles 
across our businesses.

We continue to take action to address 
any gaps and make sure our policies 
and practices are fair including actively 
reviewing decisions around our annual 
compensation review cycle. 

All figures relate to Close Brothers 
Group as a whole. We provide a 
breakdown of our figures for the 
Banking Division, Close Brothers 
Asset Management, and Winterflood 
Securities in the appendices to this 
document.

Our Group-wide gender pay gap

7

The gender pay gap is defined as the 
difference between the average (mean 
or median) earnings male and female 
colleagues receive, as a percentage  
of men’s earnings. These figures are  
provided in the chart opposite based 
on hourly rate of pay as at 5 April 2017. 

Understanding our  
gender pay gap

This chart shows the gender split 
within four equal quartiles, when we 
order the hourly rate of pay from  
highest to lowest. It also provides 
details of the gender pay gap within 
each quartile. 

The overwhelming majority of our  
gender pay gap exists because  
women hold fewer senior positions 
within the Group.

If we adjust for the fact that we have 
more men in senior positions by  
instead looking at the differences  
in average pay between males and  
females in the same salary band,  
the gap drops to 1.6%. We are  
confident that this remaining gap  
is due to differences in roles and  
responsibilities within the pay band, 
and that all employees are paid  
equally when they are performing  
the same role.

Gender bonus gap figures

Our Group-wide gender bonus gap

The gender bonus gap is defined as the difference 
between the mean or median annual bonus figure 
that male and female colleagues received in the 
year to 5 April 2017, as a proportion of the  
male figure. 

Understanding our gender bonus 
pay gap

All colleagues within the Group are eligible to  
receive a bonus. 

The reason for those not receiving a bonus is  
generally down to one of two factors: 
• 

 The individual joined the company after a certain 
point in the annual compensation review cycle

• 

 Unsatisfactory performance during the year

We are confident that performance is measured  
fairly and we analyse the gender split of our  
performance ratings to ensure equitable treatment 
of all our employees. In FY17, a higher proportion of 
males received an unsatisfactory performance rating 
than women. The difference in percentage between 
males and females that actually received a bonus 
can therefore be attributed to a higher number of 
females joining the organisation during the year.

We are aware that our gender bonus pay gap is higher than our gender pay gap. There are two main reasons for this. 

82%

88%

of our front office roles are filled by men

of our part-time roles are filled by women

Front office roles generally attract a higher level of 
variable remuneration than back office and support 
function roles due to market driven factors beyond 
our control.

As salary directly impacts bonus opportunity, part-time 
employees will  receive a pro-rated bonus compared  
to a full time employee performing the same role.

As outlined on page 5, we are taking a number of steps to address these imbalances. We have put in place initiatives 
to attract talented women into our front office roles, and to coach and develop them once they are in these roles. 
We are committed to providing part-time or other flexible working opportunities where possible for all our colleagues 
regardless of gender or life stage, and have put in place policies and benefits to support working parents. 

Summary statement

We have made good progress since first taking action on diversity 
and inclusion in 2014, but know we have a long road ahead of us. 
We are committed to taking steps to reduce our gender pay gap, 
and to support our talented females through their careers at Close 
Brothers. We want to strive for better gender balance across all 
levels and areas of our organisation.
