 

Gender Pay Gap Report  
(5 April 2017 snapshot)  
 
What is the gender pay gap report?  
 
Gender  pay  reporting  legislation  requires  employers  with  250  or  more  employees 
from  April  2017  to  publish  statutory  calculations  every  year  showing  how  large  the 
pay  gap  is  between  their  male  and  female  employees.  There  are  two  sets  of 
regulations.  
 

  The  first  is  mainly  for  the  private  and  voluntary  sectors  (taking  effect  from  5 

April 2017); and 

 

  The second is mainly for the public sector (taking effect from 31 March 2017). 

Employers will have up to 12 months to publish their gender pay gaps.  

 
The results must be published on the employer's website and a government website 
and  where  applicable,  be  confirmed  in  a  written  statement.  This  process  helps  to 
support and encourage action to take  steps to improve gender equality and reduce 
or eliminate any gender pay gap. 

 

What is the difference between gender pay reporting to equal pay?  
 

  Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry 
out  the  same  jobs,  similar  jobs  or  work  of  equal  value.  It  is  unlawful  to  pay 
people unequally because they are a man or a woman.  

 

  The  gender  pay  gap  shows  the  difference  in  the  average  pay  between  all 
men and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender 
pay gap, this could indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with and 
the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are.  

 
The majority of Livewell Southwest employees’ terms and conditions follow the NHS 
Agenda  for  Change  (AfC).    There  are  however  a  small  proportion  of  employees 
within  Livewell  Southwest  (197)  that  have  transferred  from  Local  Government.  
These employees’ terms of conditions follow transferred local agreements (Plymouth 
Book) and National Joint Council (NJC) terms and conditions. 
 
In  addition,  all  posts  are  matched  to  AfC  national  job  profiles  or  job  evaluated  to 
determine which pay band or grade a post should sit.

The gender pay gap indicators  
 
An employer must publish six calculations showing their:  
 

 

  Average gender pay gap as a mean average; 
  Average gender pay gap as a median average;  
  Average bonus gender pay gap as a mean average; 
  Average bonus gender pay gap as a median average; 
  Proportion  of  males  receiving  a  bonus  payment  and  proportion  of  females 

receiving a bonus payment;  

  Proportion of males and females when divided into four groups ordered from 

lowest to highest pay.  

 
What is meant by the mean and the median for gender pay 
reporting? 
 

  Mean:  to  find  the  mean,  add  up  the  salaries  for  all  employees  across  the 

organisation and then divide that figure by the number of employees. 

 

  Median: list the salaries for all employees set in numerical order and identify 

which salary appears in the middle of the list.
