For an individual woman or girl, being able to choose when and whether she has children means having the power to take control of her future.  It can mean having the ability to finish her education, pursue a career, look after the children she already has or ensure she and her family remains healthy. Every single day we provide more than 35,000 women across 37 countries with life-changing contraception and safe abortion services.  Read more about what we do    We welcome the UK government’s ambition to close the gender pay gap across the economy (currently at 18.1%) within a generation. Our own organisational ambition is to close the mean gender pay gap (currently 7.7%) in our Global Support Office and to halve the mean gender pay gap for the UK Division (currently 58.9%).  This process has given us the opportunity to reflect on what we might do better, what needs further review and also challenges within the wider UK healthcare sector and the role that we can play in driving broader change.  Marie Stopes International’s workforce in the UK includes staff supporting our global development programming and staff focused on providing NHS-funded abortion services through our network of clinics and the combined gender pay gap for these two groups is 45.2% (mean) and 36.8% (median).          Our team members in the UK  Our workforce in the UK is split into two distinct areas:   Marie Stopes International’s Global Support Office, which includes our global Executive Team, and provides the strategic, technical and support functions for our international development programmes across 37 countries.  Marie Stopes UK , our UK clinics division, which provides NHS-funded and private abortion services through a network of centres in England.   These two workforces are reported together under the single legal entity, Marie Stopes International, and the gender pay gap figures are combined. They are, however, two separate workforces with distinct structures and so we have provided detailed analysis in this report of the gender pay gaps at both the Marie Stopes International Global Support Office and Marie Stopes UK.                                       Marie Stopes International employs 741 people in the UK, with 546 people working at Marie Stopes UK, our UK Clinics Division, and 195 in the Global Support Office supporting the work of our programmes in 37 countries in the developing world. Our workforce in the UK is predominantly (80%) female, and we have more women than men at every pay quartile and level.  This is also reflected in the make-up of our most senior leadership, with women holding eight of the 12 positions on the Global Executive Team and UK Executive Team.                 Marie Stopes International Global Support Office                     The Marie Stopes International Global Support Office provides strategic and technical support to our programmes in the developing world. The workforce is made up of 61% female team members and there is a majority of women at every pay quartile and in senior leadership positions.                There is strong female representation in senior leadership roles, with a greater proportion of women in the Leadership Team (65%), the Executive Team (66%) and on the Board of Trustees (63%) than in the overall workforce (61%).         There are more women than men in each of the pay quartiles and there is a positive pay gap in all but one (Upper middle) of the pay quartiles.                 There are, however, greater proportions of men in the Upper and Upper middle quartiles than in the overall workforce, with 47% in the Upper quartile and 43% in the Upper middle quartile against 39% in the overall workforce. This over-representation of men in the two highest paid quartiles is driving an overall mean pay gap in the Global Support Office of 7.7% and a median pay gap of 12.2%.  When the organisation meets key performance indicators, relating to financial health and overall performance, an additional annual payment is made to qualifying team members employed in permanent positions. This payment is calculated as a percentage of salary, with the same percentage applied to all team members.  A small number of team members (on the Executive Team) also have ‘at-risk’ pay as part of their remuneration package and this portion of their package is only paid when organisational performance metrics are met. The mean bonus gap in the Global Support Office is 51.9% and the median bonus gap is 15.8%          Marie Stopes UK                     Marie Stopes UK is our UK clinics division, which provides NHS-funded and private abortion services through a network of centres in England. It operates under a separate structure to the Global Support Office, with the UK Managing Director reporting to our Global CEO. The clear majority (87%) of our workforce in the UK is female and there are proportionally more women in each pay quartile but there are disproportionately more men in the Upper quartile (29%) than in the overall workforce (13%).                The proportion of women (87%) and men (13%) in clinical roles in the UK division mirrors the overall workforce. There are, however, a greater proportion of women (98%) in nursing roles and a greater proportion of men (55%) in senior clinical roles and there are significantly more men (74%) in the clinical roles with the highest hourly rates (surgeons and anaesthetists). It should be noted that the majority of our surgeons and anaesthetists are ‘sessional’ workers rather than permanent employees who work on average around 30 hours each month, although this can be as low as eight hours each month. Their hourly pay reflects the specialism of their work and is driven by the market for their services.                    With men over-represented in the highest paid clinical roles (as they are in the wider UK healthcare sector) when compared to the overall workforce there is a significant gender pay gap in the UK Division: 58.9% mean pay gap and 32.5% median pay gap. This over-representation also has a significant impact on the gender bonus gap in the UK Division.  When the organisation meets key performance indicators, relating to quality and client satisfaction, an additional annual payment is made to qualifying team members employed in permanent positions. This payment is calculated as a percentage of salary, with the same percentage applied to all team members. A small number of team members (on the Executive Team) also have ‘at-risk’ pay as part of their remuneration package and this portion of their package is only paid when organisational performance metrics are met. The mean bonus gap in the UK Division is 48.1% and the median bonus gap is 53.3%.          Combined reporting figures and actions  The majority (74%) of our UK-based workforce are employed in our UK Division and so our combined figures for Marie Stopes International are weighted towards the figures from the UK clinical operations.  Proportion of women and men in each pay quartile:          Female    Male      Upper    58%    42%      Upper middle    83%    17%      Middle    88%    12%          Lower    90%    10%          Mean gender pay gap: 45.2% Median gender pay gap: 36.8%  Proportion of women receiving a bonus: 71.3% Proportion of men receiving a bonus: 73.8%  Mean bonus gap: 74.5% Median bonus gap: 64.4%  We believe in equality of opportunity for all and are absolutely committed to ensuring that there are no barriers or biases in place at Marie Stopes International that deny equality of opportunity to women or any other group in society.  Across both our UK Division and the Global Support Office we are reviewing a wide range of processes that might drive the gender pay gap, with a particular focus on recruitment and promotion. We are also interrogating further data sets to fully understand whether there are areas of bias (conscious or unconscious) or barriers that we need to address. This review, along with any recommendations will be complete by August 2018.  The gender pay gap in our UK Division (and thus the wider organisation) is, in part, driven by a structural under-representation of women in senior clinical roles in abortion care. We recognise that we cannot easily change this on our own and it requires long-term thinking from organisations working across UK healthcare provision. We are committed to being part of that change and will seek external partners, professional bodies and government departments with whom we can work to address this challenge over the coming years.
