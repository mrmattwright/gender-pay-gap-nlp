MEDIAN GENDER PAY GAP    MEAN GENDER PAY GAP      1.1%    0.12%      UK Median for full and part time employees in 2017 is reported as 18.4% (Source: Office for National Statistics).  McMullen’s of Hertford Limited is reporting below this figure at 1.1%      MEAN BONUS PAY GAP    MEDIAN BONUS PAY GAP      49.3%    25%      This is calculated by looking at the number of male and female employees who earned a bonus during the 12 months ending 5 April, 2017.  Our calculations show:   63.5% of male employees received a bonus  62.5% of female employees received a bonus         Quartile Results  This calculation requires an employer to show the proportions of male and female full pay relevant employees in four quartile pay bands.      Pay Distribution    Male    Female      Upper Quartile    45%    55%      Upper Middle    42%    58%      Lower Middle    47%    53%      Lower Quartile    47%    53%        These results reflects our long standing team career development policy which provides clear and accessible opportunities to train and develop and pay that reflects performance and responsibility.  Our strategy of people development helps us to meet our company goals, our stated purpose, our vision and enables us to build strong in-house teams with strength in depth.  Our strategy remains to retain our good team members by offering the opportunity for them to progress their skills and career and by treating them well in a workplace that is both fun and happy.   At the time of writing 56% of our managed estate is operated by General Managers who have come through our career development programme.  We recognise that there is a higher proportion of males in General Manager and Kitchen Manager positions which impacts the bonus pay gap figures.  Higher bonuses are made for these particular roles due to the skills shortage at this level which affects the hospitality industry as a whole. We are glad to report that as at 5 April 2017, our Assistant Manager roles were 28 female and 29 male which bodes well for the General Managers gender ratio.
