We have therefore provided additional disclosure in the report below to differentiate between our statutory reporting (all employees – employees and workers) and our own internal employees only. Sellick Partnership Employees & Agency Workers: Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile: Sellick Partnership Employees Only: Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile: Sellick Partnership Employees & Agency Workers (Statutory Reporting) This gender pay analysis is required as part of our statutory reporting. As a recruitment business a significant proportion of this population relates to agency workers who are engaged at our client sites. We do not have complete control over these rates of pay as these are determined by our clients. We do however endeavour to put forward a fair representation of male and female workers for each role. This is something we continually strive to improve across all sectors and all levels of role. Sellick Partnership Employees Only This is additional gender pay analysis that isolates a subsection of the statutory report for our own employees that provide recruitment services. The Board of Directors at Sellick Partnership take the gender pay gap seriously and continuously look to align rates of pay throughout the business.  This begins at the recruitment stage, throughout promotions and up to company Board level. We ensure to look at all causes of the gender pay gap and attempt to mitigate these wherever possible through open and transparent salary reviews. Declaration For and on behalf of the Board of Directors of Sellick Partnership Limited we confirm that this Gender Pay Gap Report is accurate.
