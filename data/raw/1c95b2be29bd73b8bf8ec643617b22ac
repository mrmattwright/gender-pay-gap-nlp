Our aim is to help older people, vulnerable adults and people with acquired brain injury to live independently in their own home with the outstanding care they need and deserve.  We encourage support from family and friends and aim to create links with the local community through our range of community services including pop-in, special interest and dementia clubs .  See PramaCARE for details on our domiciliary care service and PramaLIFE for more details on all our community services.  The Care Quality Commission recently gave us an ' Outstanding ' rating under the 'Care' category in their inspection and we’re delighted that in a survey of over 500 clients, 99% say they would recommend us .  Our Vision  A world where no-one is unfairly disadvantaged or excluded, because of age or infirmity, and where every person can enjoy life as they age.  Our Mission  As a Christian Charity we enable those who live with vulnerability or isolation enjoy their independence, lead fulfilling lives and fully contribute to society.  Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2017-2018  Prama is delighted to achieve figures significantly better than the national average. In practice the average of female staff rates is actually slightly higher than the male average. This is due to there being  more women filling middle management, training and administration roles, which carry pay rates above the averages for care work and shop staff. Pramacare has a predominantly female workforce with men representing only 8.5% of the total.  Download the full report here How We Came About  Prama came about thanks to the late Dr. Chris Moran who launched Pramacare in 1982, initially to offer help to recently discharged hospital patients. Help was provided at that time from a handful of local church volunteers. Since then our volunteer family has grown to over 100 and we now employ nearly 300 staff working out of our Head Office in Poole or our local offices in Blandford and Kinson, or our charity shops in Ringwood, Poole, West Moors, Kinson, Tuckton, Parkstone or Ashley Cross.  Prama has built a reputation for home care on a strong and solid foundation of Christian values. That’s not to say we’re an exclusively religious organisation - our clients and staff come from a range of faiths, or no faith - but it is our core values that have enabled us to develop the reputation that we are proud to have. Who's Who  As a charity, we are governed by a Board of Trustees who support the Senior Management Team and staff to deliver our services.
