It’s simply the right thing to do both for our business and for individuals.  We’re a customer-led agriculture business but with engineering at its heart – that’s our heritage. With this comes a history of a highly technically skilled and long serving workforce that is male dominated. Our gender make-up as a company has seen very similar trends to other companies with a strong engineering focus. We see this continue to the present day as, whilst we’ve seen a gradual increase in female employees, our workforce remains male dominated.  We’re not resting on our laurels when it comes to gender diversity – our gender diversity taskforce is chaired by Colm McKay (Agriculture Director) and is focused on actions to deliver against clear priorities to ensure that men and women are treated equally and fairly, from when they apply to join our team and throughout their time with us as they build successful careers.         The figures outlined below are accurate and show both the mean and median differential in pay between genders across British Sugar. As of 5th April 2017, British Sugar employed 1084 men and 280 women.         We have a strong focus on Early Careers and every year we actively attract, recruit and develop female Apprentices and Graduates onto our development schemes. We ensure that a female manager is at every careers fair, interview, assessment centre and development centre.  We are also doing some important work on all of our people policies and processes to ensure that they accommodate the needs of both men and women at work.  Together with my leadership team I want to promote a culture where all applications are welcome, all contributions are recognised and promotion is based on talent, regardless of gender or background.
