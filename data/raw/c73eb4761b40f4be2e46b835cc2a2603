concerning the disproportionate number of women in senior managerial positions
compared with men in these roles. With the new mandatory requirements for all UK businesses with
at least 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap calculations, we see an
opportunity to address this disparity and build on the
steps as are already taking towards developing more diverse teams.     As we want every employee of SLR to feel included and valued, we welcome the UK Government’s requirements for greater transparency within businesses, as it will help us to monitor our progress, and strive for the most gender balanced workplace.  About the Gender Pay Report  As part of the UK Government’s approach to achieving gender equality, all UK employers with more than 250 employees must collect and publish data on the difference between their average salaries for men and women, as of 05 April 2017. This report covers:   the      mean and median gender pay gap the      bonus mean and median gender pay gap the      proportion of men and women receiving a bonus payment the      proportion of men and women in each quartile band  We conﬁrm that the gender pay gap information and data contained in this report is accurate as of the snapshot date of 5 April 2017.
