However, like many organisations Wealmoor appreciates the broader challenges faced by society and organisations that impact women in the workplace.  While the Equal Pay Act (1970) and the Equality Act (2010) prohibit unequal treatment of men and women in terms of pay and conditions that do the same or similar jobs, gender pay considers the difference between the gross hourly earnings of men and women across the organisation.   All companies that employ 250 or more staff must publish their gender pay gap under new UK legislation that was passed in April 2017. Employers are required to provide the gap in pay between women and men on a mean basis (average hourly salary) and a median basis (the salary value in the mid-point of the pay distribution) also reported as hourly pay.  Furthermore, employers must show the distribution of gender pay by splitting their workforce into four groups while showing the number of women and men in each group (i.e. gender pay distribution by quartiles).  Finally, employers must also reveal percentages of employees receiving bonuses and the gender pay gap of these bonuses.  This report goes beyond the statutory report requirement and provides additional voluntary context concerning gender pay at Wealmoor and what actions management will take to respond to the gender pay gap issues disclosed in this report.   What is gender pay showing?  The gender pay gap shows the difference between men and women’s earnings across the business by showing women’s pay as a percentage of men’s pay.  As mentioned in our introduction, this is different to equal pay, which refers to men and women receiving equal pay for equal work.   The gender pay gap at Wealmoor  This gender pay gap report is based on data as at 5 April 2017.  On this date, Wealmoor Ltd employed 667 relevant employees of which 273 (40.9%) were women and 394 (59.1%) were men.  The overall gender pay gap as at 5 April 2017 at Wealmoor is 2% on a median basis (and 20% on a mean basis).  While we’re pleased that are gender pay gap is significantly below UK median (18.4% – Source: Office of National Statistics) Wealmoor is committed to closing it.  The reality that there are more women in the lower quartiles at Wealmoor is largest contributor to the overall gender pay gap. Like many businesses, another significant factor impacting the gender pay gap at Wealmoor is lower number of women than men in senior roles. This issue of a structural demographic pay gap has been acknowledged widely by government and transcends most sectors and industries in the UK.   Pay Quartiles  The chart below sets out the gender profile by pay quartiles. Each quartile has an equal number of employees with the fourth quartile have the highest paid employees and the first quartile having the lowest paid employees.        Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4    Women  54%  51%  37%  22%    Men  46%  49%  63%  78%       After analysing our data, women are well represented in the first and second quartiles which account for our operational workforce. However, like many organisations we face the challenge of fewer women in more senior positions.   Bonus Pay Gap  The images below show the percentage of male and female employees who received a bonus payment at Wealmoor and the percentage difference in bonus amount between them for the year ending 5 April 2017.  Percentage of men and women who received a bonus     Women  25.3%    Men  25.6%       Bonus pay gap     Mean  -2.9%    Median  12.4%       While contractual bonuses are issued to a very small number of employees, Wealmoor has consistently issued discretionary bonus payments to over half of the employee population to reward their positive contribution in the company’s success. Bonus payments have been distributed in almost equal number between male and female employees.  The bonus pay gap is largely caused by the higher number of males in senior positions, which usually equates to a higher bonus payment as a percentage of salary.   Action Plan  If we are to close the gender pay gap then it will only be done through collaborative, targeted and consistent actions. We are passionate about ensuring our business is a rich, diverse and fair environment that appeals to everyone. Gender equality and gender pay parity are high on our agenda and as such we are committed to the following targets and actions:   Targets   To maintain at least 50% women on our Executive Board  To have at least 30% women in our Senior Management Team by 2020    Actions to attract, support, develop and empower women in our workforce   To aim for at least 50% female candidates on recruitment shortlists for middle-management and senior level roles  To aim for at least 30% female delegates on our management and leadership programmes  Review of our maternity pay and introduction of a shared parental leave policy to better support parents in the early stages of their babies’ life and to allow a greater degree of flexibility in the way they care for their children  We will create a special forum for future aspiring talent and current female leaders to understand and address common challenges and to develop skills  Every member of the senior management team will mentor high-potential female colleagues  We will review our current job structures to identify ways in which we can create more flexible positions that will be more accommodating to female employees    Declaration  I confirm that Wealmoor’s gender pay calculations are accurate and meet the requirements of the Regulations and our methodology and data are in line with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
