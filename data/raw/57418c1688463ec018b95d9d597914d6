JF Renshaw Ltd
Gender Pay Gap Analysis

1

Introduction

JF Renshaw Ltd is committed to equality and diversity, endeavouring to be an inclusive workforce where 
anyone can reach their full potential.  

From April 2017, all organisations that employ over 250 employees are required to report annually on their 
Gender Pay Gap, which is defined as the relative difference in the average gross hourly earnings of women 
and men. 

The overall Gender Pay Gap for JF Renshaw Ltd is 5.01%, which is favourable due to a high number of 
Production Operatives, who all earn a set hourly wage.  Whilst the business will be reporting on the Mean 
and Median pay gaps, for the purposes of further analysis we have made the decision to break down the 
data, to provide a full and transparent view of the Gender Pay Gap at JF Renshaw Ltd.  

As a Food Manufacturer, more than 75% of our colleagues work within our factory, where 78% of the 
workforce is male.  This is in line with the latest ONS data however, overall, it does mean that there is a 
gender imbalance. With a turnover rate of 4% (April 2017), it will take time for this to be addressed.

Given the overall gender split figures, it is not surprising that there is a male bias throughout both 
management and non management roles across the site.  

Of the 26% management roles on site, the data shows that female colleagues are slightly better represented at 
the management level than in non-management roles.

What Next? 

It is our intention to understand the data in more detail and develop a plan to address some key 
areas.  In the short term:
• We will review all of our policies, procedures and guidelines to encourage inclusivity across the 

business, with particular focus on our family friendly policies.

• We will pay particular attention to our recruitment practices, including a review of the training 

provided to all recruiting managers. 

Future initiatives will include:
•

Benchmarking and reviewing all roles to ensure that fair and equitable gradings are in place, 
ensuring that the pay of males and female colleagues, doing similar roles, are comparable.
Encouraging greater female representation in our candidate and talent pools. 
Looking at career development and progression to ensure that they are inclusive and encourage 
diversity.
