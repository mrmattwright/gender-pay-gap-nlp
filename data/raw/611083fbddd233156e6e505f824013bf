Eligibility & right to work – what does that mean? Anyone who would like to work in the UK needs to prove his or her right to work. When you come along for your interview we will ask you to bring in some relevant documents so we can verify your right to work which is usually your passport, your long birth certificate combined with evidence of your National Insurance number or a valid work visa. Please noted, an offer of employment cannot be made without your eligibility, so please don’t forget to bring it with you.  Do you have a paper application form I can use? Unfortunately, we don’t accept paper based applications. All our roles are advertised and managed by our easy to use recruitment system online. We’ve found that this gives our candidates the best possible experience. If you don’t have a cv there are lots of easy to use websites where you can create a cv for free using ready-made templates.  I have applied to you; will I hear back about my application and when will this be? Thanks for your application! We are committed to contacting all applicants to let them know the outcome as soon as possible; however, it’s difficult to give an accurate timescale. We’ll keep you updated on email, so make sure you check your emails regularly.  Will you hold my details on file until a suitable vacancy arises? We will keep your details on file for 6 months.  If I am unsuccessful, can you give me feedback? Due to the high level of applicants we are unable to give feedback.  What qualifications are needed? This is dependent upon the position you apply for and the criterion on the job specification. Your existing qualification level will be assessed in addition to your experience.  I’ve found the perfect role and I’d like to apply quickly! Can I just email my CV? We’d like to make sure that your application doesn’t get lost in cyber-space, that’s why we ask that all applicants apply through our tracking system. This means we can keep a close eye on the progress of your application, you get immediate updates from us and know where your application is up too. The recruitment tracking system is really quick and easy to use and should no more than 15 minutes to apply with your cv.  How do I apply for a Job within the Klondyke Group?
