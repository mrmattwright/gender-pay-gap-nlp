2.  CONTEXT AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 

 

Following  introduction  of  the  Equality  Act  2010  (Specific  Duties  and  Public  Authorities) 
Regulations 2017, and a subsequent government consultation, it has become mandatory for 
public  sector  organisations  employing  in  excess  of  250  staff  to  report  annually  on  the 
Gender Pay Gap (GPG). Gender Pay Gap should not be confused with unequal pay, which is 
an  unlawful  practice  of  paying  men  and  women  differently  for  performing  the  same  or 
similar  work  or  work  of  equal  value.  The  gender  pay  gap  is  a  measure  of  the  difference 
between the average (mean and median) earnings of men and women.  

The  East  and  North  Hertfordshire  NHS  Trust  (“Trust”)  is  committed  to  reporting  the 
following  information,  as  per  the  requirements  of  schedule  1  (pay  gap  reporting)  of  the 
Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017:  

1.  The  difference  between  the  mean  hourly  rate  of  pay  of  male  full-pay  relevant 

employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees 

2.  The  difference  between  the  median  hourly  rate  of  pay  of  male  full-pay  relevant 

employees and that of female full-pay relevant employees  

3.  The difference between the mean bonus pay paid to  male relevant employees and 

that paid to female relevant employees  

4.  The difference between the median bonus pay paid to male relevant employees and 

that paid to female relevant employees  

5.  The proportions of male and female relevant employees who were paid bonus pay 
6.  The proportions of male and female full-pay relevant employees in the lower, lower 

middle, upper middle and upper quartile pay bands 

The  Trust  will  be  reporting  the  above  information  by  no  later  than  30th  March  2018  and 
thereafter  annually via the government’s online reporting service. This information will be 
supported  by  a  written  statement,  authorised  by  an  appropriate  senior  person,  which 
confirms  the  accuracy  of  their  calculations.  However,  this  requirement  only  applies  to 
employers subject to the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. 
The Trust is also committed to developing a robust action plan based on the findings, as well 
as  monitoring  and  reporting  quarterly  on  the  progress  of  the  identified  actions  to  the 
Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Steering Group as well as Risk and Quality Committee. 

All information captured in this report is based on the calculations made relating to the pay 
period  in  which  the  snapshot  day  falls.  For  the  purpose  of  the  2016/17  analysis,  this  has 
been set as 31st March 2017. (N.B. any enhancements for unsocial hours for staff on agenda 
for  change  and  medical  and  dental  contracts  are  paid  a  month  in  arrears,  therefore  the 
aforementioned element will reflect the additional work undertaken in February 2017).

3.  DATA ANALYSIS 

 

1.  Mean  gender  pay  gap  –  the  collected  data  suggests  that  the  gender  pay  gap  for 

mean average ordinary earnings for women is 29% less than for men. 

2.  Median  gender  pay  gap  –  the  collected  data  suggests  that  the  gender pay  gap  for 

median average ordinary earnings for women is 13.17% less than for men.  

 
For the calculation of an ordinary pay the following has been taken into consideration: 

  Basic pay 
  Paid  leave,  including  annual,  sick,  maternity,  paternity,  adoption  or  parental  leave 
(except  where  an employee  is  paid  less than  usual  or nothing  because of  being on 
leave) 

  Area  and  other  allowances  (N.B.  the  Trust,  due  to  its  sites  geographical  location, 
awards outer, fringe and no  High Cost Area Supplement, depending on employees’ 
main base of work) 

  Shift premium pay, defined as the difference between basic pay and any higher rate 

paid for work during different times of the day or night 

  Pay for piecework 

 
The calculation of an ordinary pay does not include any of the following: 

  Remuneration referable to overtime. 
  Remuneration referable to redundancy or termination of employment 
  Remuneration in lieu of leave 
  Remuneration provided otherwise than in money.

3.  Mean bonus pay gap – the collected data suggest that the gender pay gap for mean 

average bonus earnings for women is 34.24% less than for men. 

4.  Median bonus pay gap – the collected data suggests that the gender pay gap for 

median average bonus earnings for women is 33.33% less than for men. 

For the calculation of a bonus pay the following has been taken into consideration: 

  Any remuneration that is in the form of money, vouchers, securities, securities 

options, or interests in securities, and 

  Relating to profit sharing, productivity, performance, incentive or commission.

NB – Bonus payments in the Trust are exclusively made up from Medical Consultants’ merit 
awards (i.e. Clinical Excellence Awards) 

 

 

5.  Gender composition of bonuses – the collected data suggests that the proportion of 

males receiving a bonus was 6.42%, whilst 0.81% of female employees were in 
receipt of a bonus payment.

Taking into account that the sole source of the bonus payments on 31st March 2017 was the 
medical  consultants’  merit  awards,  it  is  felt  that  the  data  is  not  representative.  309 
employees  (medical  consultants)  would  have  been  considered  for  the  aforementioned 
bonus payment. The table below represents the consultant body with gender composition 
and bonus payments distribution. Out of 309 eligible staff, 119 were in receipt of some kind 
of clinical merit award, which equated to 38.51%.  

36.27% of female compared to 39.61% of male medical consultants were paid the award.

7.  Additional reporting – In looking to give greater detail around the mean difference, 
additional reports were taken from ESR – the following highlights the differences by 
staff group. Negative figures in AHP and Nursing and Midwifery staff groups indicate 
a gender pay gap in favour of females. The most significant gender pay gap in favour 
of  males  are admin  and  clerical,  healthcare  scientists  and,  medical  staff  with  a pay 
gap of 24.55%, 17.84% and 21.03% respectively.

8.  Agenda for change vs. medical and dental – the trust has also undertaken analysis 

of staff pay in order to identify potential gender pay gap separating Agenda for 
Change and Medical and Dental terms and conditions of pay. The data suggests that 
gender pay gap for agenda for change employees is in favour of females, whilst the 
medical and dental staff group’s gender pay gap is in favour of males.

4.  ENHT PAY ARRANGEMENTS 

As noted earlier in this report, it is important to stress that the Gender Pay Gap is different 
to Equal Pay. Equal pay deals with the pay differences between men and women who carry 
out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally 
because they are a man or a woman.  

Legislation requires that men and women must receive equal pay for: 

the same or broadly similar work; 

 
  work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or 
  work of equal value.  

The  trust  is  committed  to  the  principle  of  equal opportunities  and  equal  treatment  for  all 
employees,  regardless  of  sex,  race,  religion  or  belief,  age,  marriage  or  civil  partnership, 
pregnancy/maternity,  sexual  orientation,  gender  reassignment  or  disability.  We  pay 
employees  equally  for  the  same  or  equivalent  work,  regardless  of  their  sex  (or  any  other 
characteristic set out above).   

The  trust  delivers  equal  pay  through  a  number  of  means  but  primarily  through  adopting 
nationally agreed terms and conditions for our workforce: 

 

National NHS Agenda for Change Terms and Conditions of Service (AfC)   

AfC is negotiated nationally by the NHS Staff Council, led by NHS Employers.  The national 
NHS Staff Council has overall responsibility for the AfC pay system and has representatives 

 

6 

 
from both employers and trade unions.  AfC provides the framework for pay arrangements 
which are in place at ENHT.   

Typically,  AfC  terms  and  conditions  apply  to  nursing,  allied  health  professionals  and 
administration and clerical staff, which are the majority of the workforce.   

On occasion, the trust may consider an incremental credit request for candidates joining the 
trust from outside of the NHS and can evidence comparable experience.  

Medical and Dental Staff are employed on national Terms and Conditions of Service 
(TCS) and pay arrangements   

These  pay  arrangements  are  negotiated  nationally  on  behalf  of  employers  by  NHS 
Employers with the NHS trade unions.  These terms and conditions include all Consultants, 
Medical and Dental staff and Doctors and Dentists in Training.  

 

5.  ACTIONS TO MINIMISE GENDER PAY GAP AND ENSURE EQUAL PAY 

The trust is committed to addressing identified in this report Gender Pay Gap. A number of 
actions have been suggested to ensure that the trust continues to follow the best practice in 
addressing the issue: 

  The trust is committed to undertake further, detailed diagnostic into the pay gap, in 

particular for the medical and dental staff group to identify the reasons for the gap 
 

  All female employees in the medical and dental staff group will be written to in order 
to  encourage  them  to  submit  applications  for  Clinical  Excellence  Awards,  which 
consequently could have an impact on the identified pay gap in relation to the bonus 
payments.  
 

  The  trust’s  recruitment  and  selection  policy  and  process  for  internal  and  external 

 

candidates will be assessed to avoid any potential bias  
 
It  is  expected  to  review  the  trust’s  current  talent  management  strategy  and 
succession planning process to incorporate avoiding unconscious bias  
 

  The  trust  will  consider  whether  there  may  be  an  opportunity  to  use  genuine 
occupational  requirement  (or  positive  discrimination)  when  advertising  for  posts 
that could be identified as underrepresented by female employees 
 

 

7 

 
  The trust will reassess its incremental credit process and starting salary procedure to 
ensure  that  these  are  awarded  on  the  merit  of  experience  and  to  avoid  potential 
gender bias 
 

  The  trust  will  continue  to  support  its  initiative  to  implement  flexible  arrangements 
across  as  many  departments  and  staff  group  as  practically  possible.  This  could 
consequently attract female candidates that otherwise would be unable to join the 
organisation due to childcare arrangements and/or maternity 
 

  The trust will consider shared parental leave and associated enhancements 

 

  The  trust  will  promote  Keep  In  Touch  (KIT)  days,  which  consequently  could  have  

appositive impact on female employees’ pay 

The  gender  pay  gap  action  plan  and  progress  against  it  will  be  presented  quarterly  to 
Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  steering  group  and  annually  to  the  Risk  and  Quality 
Committee.
