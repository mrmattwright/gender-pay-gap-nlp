The College strives to be a transparent and accessible institution that upholds and celebrates the values of equality and diversity, recognising the benefits that a diverse staff and student population brings.  We operate a Single Equality Scheme, supplemented by an Equality Protocol giving additional guidance for staff, describing how we promote equality and diversity and aim to provide a positive work and study environment where everyone has the equal opportunity to realise their full potential in an environment where we tackle and eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation.  Everyone is treated fairly and can play a role in shaping the development of our equality and diversity practice in the future.  If you have a disability we have a team of staff who can give you additional support, and we’ll try to make reasonable adjustments to provide you with any specific equipment, technology or additional support you may need to help with your work or studies.  Equality Strategic Plan  Plymouth College of Art’s Equality Objectives for 2016-2020 set out the objectives the College will be working towards over the next three years. These objectives are supported by an implementation plan for each academic year covering the College priorities which will be focussed on in the short-term and will be reviewed for achievement by April each year.  Our staff and students  Plymouth College of Art respects each person who studies or works at the College and treats each and every one as an individual. Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations, we are legally required to publish anonymised information about our student and staff populations ‘protected characteristics’, in order to help our community understand the profile of the people accessing and working at the College.  We therefore report annually on age, disability, gender, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership (in respect of unlawful discrimination - in terms of our employees), pregnancy and maternity, race (including ethnic or national origins), religion and/or belief, and sexual orientation. Wherever possible, we compare our data with local, regional and national records from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Neighbourhood Statistics, Local Authority reports and the national census 2011.  For more information, download our Student & Staff Data 2016-17 document.  Gender Pay Gap  The College is committed to equality and diversity and offering fair opportunity to all staff and students.  Gender pay gap reporting requires employers with more than 250 employees to publish statutory calculations each year showing the pay gap between male and female employees.  We are openly reporting on the gender pay gap at Plymouth College of Art. We have provided all the necessary figures requested, excluding the calculation on bonuses as bonuses are not paid within this organisation. The gender pay gap assesses the difference between the average earning of male and female employees. Reporting on the gap helps us to identify the levels of gender equality within the workforce.  Of just over 400 staff 62% are female with the figures showing there is a good representation of female staff in the upper pay quartiles (57.5%) There is however a gender pay gap within the organisation, well below the national average of 18%.  It is important to consider the factors that could contribute to this gap. In this regard we have assessed that we have more part-time hourly paid females than males delivering our business requirements, with national statistics showing that women are more likely to work part-time.  The College has a genuine commitment to close any gaps and is undertaking the following actions:   Implementation of an Equal Pay Action Plan to identify any unjustified pay gaps.  Provide updates on the equal pay and grading policy, which will outline the commitment of the College to providing equal pay with clear accountabilities, regular monitoring and adequate resourcing of equal pay reviews.  Equality impact assessment of pay settlements, (Equality and Human Rights Commission toolkit).  Introduction of the HERA Role Analyses to help us move to a national higher education single pay spine. HERA is the leading higher education sector job evaluation scheme.  Offer of full support for staff with options for maternity and paternity leave as well as flexible working patterns.  Maintaining an open and transparent recruitment process.   Detailed information is available in the Gender Gap Pay Report .  Other information  The College has a zero tolerance policy to harassment and bullying in relation to any of the Equality Act’s protected characteristics covering students, staff and anyone else involved with the College.  The College respects the right of staff to opt out from answering particular equality and diversity monitoring questions. However, the College encourages staff to provide all data to ensure we can fully support an inclusive and diverse workforce.
