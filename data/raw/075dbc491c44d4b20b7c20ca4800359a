Background 

2 

Earlier this year, the Government introduced world-leading legislation that made 
it statutory for organisations with 250 or more employees to report annually on 
their gender pay gap. Government departments are covered by the Equality Act 
2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 which came into 
force on 31 March 2017. These regulations underpin the Public Sector Equality 
Duty and require the relevant organisations to publish their gender pay gap data 
by 30 March 2018 [and then annually], including mean and median gender pay 
gaps; the mean and median gender bonus gaps; the proportion of men and 
women who received bonuses; and the proportions of male and female 
employees in each pay quartile.  

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men 
and women in a workforce. If a workforce has a particularly high gender pay 
gap, this can indicate there may be a number of issues to deal with, and the 
individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are. 

The gender pay gap is different to equal pay. Equal pay deals with the pay 
differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs 
or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a 
man or a woman. 

The Forestry Commission supports the fair treatment and reward of all staff 
irrespective of gender.  

This report fulfils the Department’s reporting requirements, analyses the figures 
in more detail and sets out what we are doing to close the gender pay gap in the 
organisation.

The average (mean) hourly rate for males is 6.2% higher than females. This has 
reduced since the recent 2017 Equal Pay Audit which reported a mean gender 
pay gap of 6.4% based on data at 1st October 2016. The median gender pay 
gap is lower than the mean gender pay gap at 1.4%. This means that of all the 
male and female employees of FC, the middle male salary is 1.4% higher than 
the middle female salary.

FC only operates a performance bonus for the senior staff group. Up to 31 March 
2017, there were three recipients of a bonus across FC. This represents 0.1% of 
men and 0.1% of women. There was no pay gap between bonuses for men and 
women using both the mean and median calculations.

The lower quartile of staff comprises 46% female staff and the upper quartile 
comprises 31%. This compares with the wider FC population of 35% females2. If 
all quartiles were made up of 35% women, the pay gap would reduce from 6.2% 
to 1.4%. This indicates that the pay gap is largely as a result of the higher 
concentration of women in more junior grades. 
 
This can also be seen in the following table which shows the distribution of 
female and male staff by grade. The arrow denotes increasing seniority of 
grades from junior roles to senior roles. There is a greater proportion of female 
staff in the most junior grades, PB6B and PB7 and a higher proportion of males 
in more senior roles, PB4 and higher. Civil Service equivalent grades are shown 
for comparison.

However, our recent Equal Pay Audit identified that there were no significant 
equal pay issues3 (greater than 5%) across the pay bands. Pay gaps varied from 
-0.3% to 3.3% with more than 50% of pay scales having a gap of less than 1%. 
 
 

 

                                                           
2 This FC workforce is split 65% male and 35% female. These numbers cover all staff including those not on full pay at 31 March 2017 (e.g. statutory maternity pay, long  term sickness 

or unpaid career breaks)  

3 The equal pay gaps measure the pay gap between the average men and women’s salaries in the same pay bands. Staff in the same pay bands are considered to be doing work of equal 
value. The gender pay gap considers the average male and females earnings across the Forestry Commission as a whole so is also influenced by the mix of genders between different pay 
bands.

Causes of the Gender Pay Gap at FC 

Forestry work has historically attracted fewer female candidates than male 
candidates.  Although more recently this imbalance has improved, within FC the 
majority of employees (65%) are male. Furthermore, male employees within FC 
have, at most grades, more service than their female colleagues. Since 2011, 
when time-served progression through the grades was stopped, employees no 
longer receive annual increments to move them up through their pay scale.  As a 
result, employees with greater service are more likely to be at the top of their 
pay scale than those with shorter service. 

In 2005 the gender pay gap at the Forestry Commission was 21%.  Significant 
work has been undertaken over recent years to reduce this to the current 
position of 6.2%. This work has included shortening pay scales, removing 
incidences of overlapping pay scales, addressing issues around promotions and 
replacing pay spines with continuous pay scales. 

Furthermore, greater focus on diversity and inclusion has led to the proportion of 
female employees increasing from 31% to 35%.

Working to reduce the Gender Pay Gap 

The FC is committed to further improving our gender pay gap and are looking at 
a number of initiatives to reduce the gender pay gap, these include: 
 

  Pay 

  Reduce the gap between the top and bottom of the pay scales with 

particular focus on operational pay bands. 

 
  Take targeted action as part of the annual pay increase to ensure pay 

differences in grades are reduced where possible 

 
  Conduct a gender pay gap analysis at FC and pay band level at every 

annual pay award. 

 

  Gender Mix 

  Continue to carry out equality monitoring during post-filling and 

recruitment as well as reviewing language in recruitment literature to 
ensure it is gender-neutral. 

  Flexible working policies applicable to senior roles. 

  Unconscious bias training for all staff involved in recruitment. 

  Pro-actively engaging female role models to positively promote career 

 

 

 

choices.
