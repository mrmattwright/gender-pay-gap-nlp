As an employer we are committed to ensuring equality of opportunity and equality of pay; our equal pay audit is conducted every two years and we carry out robust job evaluation methodologies to ensure people are paid according to the levels of responsibility within their roles.  We value equality and have worked consistently to address this issue; this first gender pay gap report highlights that we have much more work to do in certain areas, that the causes of the gap are complex and often reflect the distribution of  roles at the university which in itself needs to be challenged.
