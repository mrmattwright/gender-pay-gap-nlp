People    Flexible Working   Actions and Targets       Gender Pay Gap               An Introduction  Tesco has a long of history of being a place for people to get on in their careers, as they wish, regardless of their background. We’re absolutely committed to providing all of our colleagues with equal opportunities, skills, flexibility and reward to help them do just that.  We were one of the first companies to voluntarily report our gender pay data in 2012 and have had measures in place to monitor the interaction between gender and pay for many years. Last year, we were among the first to publish early analysis data for Tesco UK Retail, which analysed the pay received by male and female colleagues at equal levels of work.  These reports follow the latest methodology set by the UK Government and cover the period April 2016-2017 for Tesco UK Retail, Tesco Bank and dunnhumby, comparing what all male and female colleagues are paid on average across the business and measuring the difference between male and female averages.  Most importantly, the reports set out a range of actions we are taking to help close the gap completely, including improved parental leave, enhanced coaching for future female leaders, the creation of an Inclusion Advisory Panel and signing up to the 30% Club and Women in Finance Charter. There’s always more we can do and by reviewing our data and the drivers behind it, we can better understand what else we can do to help.
