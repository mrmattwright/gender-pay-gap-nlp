GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 
2018

Seafood Holdings LtdFOREWORD

Seafood  Holdings  has  had  an  exciting  year,  further  developing  the  fish  business  into  new 
revenue streams.   

Over the last four years revenues have grown by 48% from £88.6m to £131.1m and with that, staff have 
grown by 33% to 621. This has led to a professionalisation of our Human Resources approach.  

We now pride ourselves on our diversity and inclusivity and have been actively promoting women to 
positions of authority within the business.  

Our challenge is to make the lower quartile positions more attractive to women, something we are 
targeting ourselves to achieve in the coming years.

Seafood Holdings LtdSEAFOOD HOLDINGS: OUR GENDER PAY STATISTICS.

In line with the UK government’s new Gender Pay Gap regulation, our findings and analysis show the following:

UNDERSTANDING OUR 
GENDER PAY GAP

19% of Seafood Holdings employees 
are women.  

The mean hourly rate is 4.65% 
higher than men and the median 
hourly rate 11.11% higher than men.  
This is because the positions held by 
women are on average attracting a 
higher wage than those of men.  

The bonus pay mean for women 
was 14.98% higher than men but 
the median was 17.99% lower than 
men.  This is because the bonus paid 
to women are disproportionately 
paid to the top to quartiles and the 
bonuses for men are more even 
through the quartiles.  

The big challenge is to make the fish 
business more attractive to women 
in all the quartiles with a particular 
focus on the lower quartiles.
