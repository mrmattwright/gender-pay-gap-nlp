Just wanted to know what the protocol is regarding my P45. As you are aware, I've finished my time at Harrods, and would like to know if it would be possible for you to send it out to me?  I would also like to thank both you and Kate for your continuous help and support during my time at Harrods.  It was a fantastic place to work with an amazing team, and thanks to Abacus, I have more experience in the industry.      I really can't fault Abacus, there's always work going somewhere that suits me and I can safely assume that I will be in some kind of employment without needing to chase people up constantly. Easily the best agency I have used.   I have been working weekends for you guys for about 6 years now. Everyone at Basingstoke is fabulous esp Paige. No problems what so ever!      Abacus in Salisbury have been great. I just come from Derby to live in Salisbury. I have to do some paper work with them in the early evening and they have manage to get me some work on the following day. I was so amazed how quickly they could give me some work. The team in Salisbury have been very welcoming and very helpful. Thank you Abacus to help me and find work straight away.      I thought I would e-mail Abacus to let you know how impressive Jacob and Liam have been today.  They have worked very hard and my boss was very impressed indeed.  Please pass on our thanks for a job well done.
