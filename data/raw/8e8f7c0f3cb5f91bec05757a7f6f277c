At Alpha LSG we recognise that a diverse workforce enables us to provide a richer and more engaging environment 
for colleagues and delivers huge benefits to the business. Our analysis has demonstrated a mean gap of 8.78 which 
is low compared to the aviation and manufacturing sector we occupy. The difference in pay is mainly due to the 
bulk of upper middle rate roles – drivers and chefs, being predominantly filled by men so we are encouraging more 
women into these professions through the support of our apprenticeship programme and direct advertising  
campaigns. We also have a number of colleagues who joined us by virtue of a TUPE transfer, 
with  78%  of  these  being  male,  and  while  it  is  right  and  proper  that  these  terms  remain 
protected, this does impact our overall average. All new starters join on the rate relative to the 
job, irrelevant of gender and we are confident that we meet our equal pay obligations across 
the business. While the bonus gap in Alpha LSG may suggest an issue, we’re working hard to 
redress  the  gender  balance  in  our  SLT  structure.  We  are  ensuring  robust  controls  for  new 
positions  to  ensure  fair  pay  and  to  attract,  retain  and  develop  a  diverse  and  talented 
population.
