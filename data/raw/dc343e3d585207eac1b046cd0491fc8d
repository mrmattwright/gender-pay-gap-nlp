Our quartiles depict:  Lowest quartile: The reason for the 2.14% difference is that a large portion of the quartile (24.6%) are female and under the age of 21, and as such are paid a lower hourly rate in line with minimum wage guidelines. Where as only 4.3% of males are under 21 years of age.  Quartile 2: There is no difference in the rates of pay between males and females.  Quartile 3: The main reason for the 5.11% difference in this quartile is due to the majority of males who work nights and night shift work is paid at a higher rate of pay.  Quartile 4: The difference is 5.87% and we are satisfied that everyone in this quartile are paid equally and accordingly to their job role.
