FINDINGS 

What are the underlying causes of the gender pay gap at Achilles Information Ltd 

the same or broadly similar work; 

•  Under the law, men and women must receive equal pay for: 
• 
•  work rated as equivalent under a job evaluation scheme; or 
•  work of equal value. 

We are committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all 
employees, regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, age, marriage or civil partnership, 
pregnancy/maternity, sexual orientation, gender reassignment or disability.  We have a clear 
policy of paying employees equally for the same or equivalent work, regardless of their sex 
(or any other characteristic set out above). As such, we: 

•  carry out pay and benefits audits at regular intervals; and 
•  evaluate job roles and pay grades as necessary to ensure a fair structure. 

We are therefore confident that our gender pay gap does not stem from paying men and 
women differently for the same or equivalent work, rather the gender pay gap is the result 
of the roles in which men and women work within the organisation. 

Across our sector, men are more likely to be in technical and IT-related roles, which attract 
higher rates of pay than other roles at similar levels of seniority. Women are also more likely 
to work part time, and many of the jobs that are available across the UK are on a part-time 
basis.  

This pattern from the UK economy is reflected in the make-up of our workforce, where most 
senior management roles are held by men. We also have a larger proportion of men than

women, with a gap of 41%.  This can be seen above in the table depicting pay quartiles by 
gender. This shows that our workforce divided into four equal-sized groups based on hourly 
pay rates, with  

•  Band A including the lowest-paid 25% of employees (the lower quartile) and  
•  Band D covering the highest-paid 25% (the upper quartile).  
•  For there to be no gender pay gap, there would need to be an equal ratio of men to 

women in each Band.  

Within Achilles Information Ltd, the ratio for Band A is almost equal, but the percentage of 
male employees increases throughout the remaining Bands, from 55% in Band B to 80% in 
Band D. 

COMPARISONS 

How does our gender pay gap compare with that of other organisations 

The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 Office 
for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) figures) is 17%, 
while in the Information Service Activities sector it is 21%.  At 23%, our mean gender pay gap 
is, wider than both that for the whole economy and that for our sector. 

The median gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the November 2016 ONS 
ASHE figures) is 19%, while in the Information Service Activities sector it is 25%. At 5%, our 
median gender pay gap is narrower than both that for the whole economy and that for our 
sector.

The mean gender bonus gap and the median gender bonus gap for Achilles Information Ltd 
are reasonable at 37% and 15% respectively. However, when considering the actual cash 
value of the bonus payments made, the difference is £1586.83 (mean) and £381.47 
(median), which shows that we do not pay large bonuses to individual employees. 

The proportion of men at Achilles Information Ltd who received a bonus in the 12 months 
up to 5 April 2017 was 77%, while for women this was 79%.  

What is Achilles Information Ltd doing to address its gender pay gap 

Achilles Information Ltd is committed to doing everything that it can to reduce the gap. 
However, we also recognise that our scope to act is limited with individual’s career and life 
choices.

To date, Achilles Information is reviewing a number of initiatives to promote gender diversity 
in all areas of its workforce include the following: 

•  Family friendly working - To successfully create a culture which appeals to women; 
flexibility in the workplace can and should be encouraged in particular in terms of 
hours and home-working.   As a company, we can look to actively promote a family-
friendly workplace and we are reviewing a variety of programs to achieve this, 
including the Return to Work program. Such programs offer skilled professional 
women and mature individuals who have left the workforce a path to career re-entry 
temporary basis.  

•  External Partnerships – We are exploring partnerships with associations that support 

and enable us to better inspire, attract and support women in the workplace. 
‘Women in Technology’ enables and motivates people in business and education to 
increase the participation, contribution and success of women across key sectors. 

•  Apprenticeship –  Our Talent Acquisition activity is exploring applicants via 

Apprenticeship programs to support and train women looking to work in the tech 
and services sector. 

•  Target Setting – With companies acknowledging how central gender diversity is to 

business success, one area that we are reviewing relates to the goals we need to 
work towards.  Many large corporations are setting a gender target and Atkins have a 
Gender Balance Improvement Group that constantly monitors how the company are 
progressing in their aim to increase the proportion of female staff. 

We recognise that these initiatives will not remove the gender pay gap - and it may take 
several years before some show any impact. In the meantime, Achilles Information Ltd is 
committed to reporting on an annual basis on what it is doing to reduce the gender pay gap 
and the progress that it is making. 

Any further initiatives launched throughout the year will be reported on the company 
intranet. 

I, Jay Katzen, Chief Executive Officer, confirm that the information in this statement is 
accurate.
