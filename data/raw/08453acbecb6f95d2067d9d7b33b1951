Mitie is currently one year in to a three-year transformation programme. As part of that 
transformation, we are committed to creating a place to work where people can thrive and be their 
best every day. 

Today, along with all other UK companies with 250 or more employees, we are reporting on our pay, 
by gender. As at April 5 last year, we had a mean average gender pay gap of 16% and a mean bonus 
gap of 71%. The reason for the bonus differential in particular is the way in which we classify bonuses 
across the company. And while the pay gap is in line with the UK average, we know there is more we 
can do.  

We have a diverse and complex business, and gender representation can differ depending on job 
type. We also recognise that in many of our businesses we have a higher proportion of men in more 
senior positions and bonuses are more typically paid in senior roles. 

Gender parity 

In the last six months, we have made a conscious effort towards encouraging a more diverse work 
force. 

We have reviewed the makeup of our senior team, welcoming four women to our board (out of 11 
people). Now, women count for 14% of our Executive Leadership team (up from 0%) and almost a 
quarter (24%) of our Group Leadership Team (up from 20%). 

Diversity 

However, whilst gender is the focus of these figures, we believe it is only one element of building an 
inclusive working culture. At Mitie, we are very proud of our rich and diverse culture and 
backgrounds – it creates ideas and insights. Everyone has a voice and is treated as an 
equal. We are relaunching our four diversity networks focusing on LGBT, disability, ethnicity and 
gender to concentrate on education, awareness and supported by our company policies. 

Development 

We also believe everyone should have opportunities to progress, whether that’s working with 
amazing customers to individual learning and development. We’re helping our colleagues achieve 
their full potential by creating a ‘one stop shop’ for all development at Mitie called ‘the Learning 
Hub’. The Hub will bring all learning and development interventions together from a vast array of 
apprenticeship programmes, to technical accreditations and leadership training.  

Reviewing our processes  

As part of our overall transformation, we’re looking at how we reward our people with a job 
grading framework on which to base pay decisions.

Another area of focus will be on closing the gap and clearing up our bonus definitions. For 
example, clarifying the difference between an hourly attendance bonus for a front-line cleaner and 
an executive bonus for our most senior leaders. 

The above combined are a start and while we’re making headway, we still have a way go on our 
transformational journey. 

We have reported on 15 legal entities that meet the reporting criteria. I confirm the gender pay gap 
data contained in this report is accurate and has been produced in accordance with the regulations.
