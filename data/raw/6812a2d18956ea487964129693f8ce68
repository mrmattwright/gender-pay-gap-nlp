BABERGH AND MID SUFFOLK DISTRICT COUNCILS’ GENDER  

PAY GAP 31st MARCH 2017 

 

WHAT IS THIS REPORT? 

Due to changes to legislation - Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 
2017 - the Councils are required to report on their gender pay gap.  These gender pay gap results 
were based on a snapshot of the pay period including 31st March 2017.  The data was prepared in 
accordance with ACAS guidelines on what should be included or excluded.  532 full-pay employees 
formed the basis of the analysis. 

The analysis has been done for the joint workforce, and then done separately for Babergh and Mid 
Suffolk District Councils as technically Babergh and Mid Suffolk District Councils (BMSDC) is not the 
employer, and we are therefore required to report on each Council separately.  This report is a 
summary of the results of the analyses. 

WHAT IS THE GENDER PAY GAP?  

The gender pay gap is the difference between female and male average hourly pay, expressed as a 
percentage of male average hourly pay. A positive figure means that the average hourly rates for 
women is less than that for men. 

 The requirement is to calculate and publish data on the: 

•  Mean gender pay gap 
•  Median gender pay gap 
•  Mean bonus gender pay gap 
•  Median bonus gender pay gap 
•  Proportion of males receiving a bonus payment 
•  Proportion of females receiving a bonus payment 
•  Proportion of males and females in quartile pay bands 

It is also recommended by ACAS that we produce a narrative setting out how we propose to reduce 
our gender pay gap.  We are publishing this set of data in March 2018 based on March 2017 data.  
The data for March 2018 will soon be available, therefore we will research the reasons for our 
gender pay gap during April and May 2018 based on the data for March 2018.  In consultation with 
staff and unions, we will then develop an action plan aimed to reduce our gender pay gap and based 
on the most up to date information.  We will then publish the March 2018 gender pay gap together 
with our action plan. 

As BMSDC do not pay bonus, there were only three calculations that we needed to make: 

1.  Mean average is where all the hourly rates for all employees who received their full pay in 

March 2017 were totalled, and the figure divided by the number of employees, giving a 
mean average hourly rate of pay.  This was done separately for males and females.  The 
difference between the male and female mean average hourly rates of pay was then 
expressed as a percentage of the mean male average hourly pay.

2.  Median average is where all weekly pay rates are sorted in numerical order, separately for 
males and females.  The median (middle) hourly rate of pay is identified for both males and 
females.  The difference between the median hourly rate of pay for males and females was 
identified.  This difference was then expressed as a percentage of the male median hourly 
rate of pay.

3.  Percentage of male and female employees in pay Quartiles  this was calculated by sorting 
the weekly pay for all full pay employees into ascending order.  The records are divided into 
four even quartiles.  The number of males and females in each quartile was identified and 
the percentage that are male and female calculated.
