The gender pay gap is the average difference between the mean or median hourly rates of pay that male and female colleagues receive.  The mean pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings of men and women.  The median pay gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly earnings of men and women. It takes all salaries in the sample, lines them up from lowest to highest, and picks the middle-most salary.
