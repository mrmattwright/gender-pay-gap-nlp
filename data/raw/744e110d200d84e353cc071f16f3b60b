Operating for more than 40 years and fiercely protective of our excellent reputation, Hayward Services is a high quality cleaning company offering a full range of contract cleaning and associated services. The current management team purchased Hayward Services in 2000. By developing a unique ethos focused on establishing long-term client partnerships, consistent service delivery and a culture of responsiveness to client needs we have grown annual turnover from £650,000 in 2000 to £9M in 2016. This growth has been fuelled by reputation and this is something we guard jealously. The success delivered by our unique approach and ethos has created a stable contract management team motivated to succeed and empowered to achieve. Such stability and motivation is not the industry norm. Based in Slough, we service clients across the southern counties from Dorset to Essex. Our portfolio of clients ranges from large office complexes to universities, schools and heritage sites. A high proportion of clients have entered successive contract terms.
