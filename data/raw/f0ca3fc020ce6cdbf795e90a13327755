Gender Pay Gap Report  

CPL Distribution 2017 

This report sets out the gender pay gap reporting requirements for CPL Distribution Limited 
under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.     

What is Gender Pay Gap? 

Gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in the average pay of male and female 
employees in an organisation, regardless of the type of work that they do.  It is different to 
equal pay, which would be a direct comparison between people doing the same or comparable 
work.  Differences in the gender pay gap can be driven by the number of male of female 
employees in different types of job.   

The regulations require that companies with more than 250 employees publish their gender 
pay gap information.  This information includes the differences in the average hour rate of pay 
between male and female employees on the 5 April 2017 (the Snap-shot Date); the differences 
in average bonus payments made to male and female employees over the 12 month period to 
the Snap-shot Date; and the proportion of male and female employees in quartile pay bands on 
the Snap-shot Date.   

The pay and bonus gender pay gaps are expressed as both a ‘mean’ and a ‘median’ average.  A 
mean average for a set of pay rates is calculated as by adding together the individual pay rates 
for each person and then dividing the sum by the number of people.  The median average for a 
set of pay rates is calculated by ranking all the pay rates in ascending order and taking the 
middle pay rate.

Commentary 

We are confident that our gender pay gap does not reflect an equal pay issue nor is it related to 
paying males and females differently.  We believe that it is as a result of the composition of our 
workforce and the types of jobs male and female employees, which is consistent with the 
pattern seen in equivalent industries in the UK.   

The principal drivers for our pay and bonus gender pay gaps are: 

•  Male employees make up a significant majority of the workforce 
•  There are a higher proportion of males that work in operational (delivery driver and 

packing roles) which typically have higher productivity bonus payments 

•  There are a higher proportion of females that work in administration, support or 

customer service roles which typically have lower (or no) productivity bonus payments. 

•  There are more male than female employees in management roles, which are higher 

paid roles.
