ETON COLLEGE

Gender pay gap report

Eton College is a boarding school for boys, based in Eton, 
Berkshire. We are committed to providing the broadest 
education for our pupils and at the heart of our school  

is a focus on engendering respect for individuality  

and embracing difference. 

Outreach and our impact on society are extremely important to us and we are proud of our partnerships 

with schools, other education establishments and our local community.

We employ almost 1,000 staff, around 250 of whom are teachers. Outside of our academic staff,  

people who work at Eton perform a variety of roles from chefs, housekeepers and grounds staff, to nurses, 

clinical psychologists, building surveyors, and office-based roles such as finance and IT.

As a school we are committed 
to diversity and equal 
opportunities for both  
pupils and staff. Our 
employee population has 
an almost 50/50 gender 
split, and this is reflected in 
the makeup of our current 
Executive Leadership Team, 
which is 44% female.

As a school, most of our higher 
paid staff are our teaching staff. 
Like many single-sex schools, our 
teachers are still predominantly 
of the same gender as the pupils. 
This factor combined with a 
low turnover of teaching staff, 
means that our more highly paid 
teachers tend to be male.

Our mean gender pay gap is 24%  
and our median is 31%. If teaching 

staff are excluded from these 
calculations, our gender pay gap  
drops to a mean and median of 4%.

We do not pay bonuses to staff, so we do not have any information about bonuses to report.

On his appointment in September 2015, the Head Master 
made diversity one of his key strategic priorities. Eton’s 
governing body is also committed to this agenda, and  
the governing body itself is now 25% female.

We are pleased that the initiatives so far put in place have 
resulted in the School receiving more job applications 
from, and appointing, more female candidates. Indeed, 
in September 2017 we appointed the first female Lower 
Master* in Eton’s history. However we recognise we have 
further work to do to increase the number of women 
and other groups currently under-represented in our 
teaching community, and we have a number of initiatives 
underway to help us achieve this goal. 

We also recognise the importance of our boys holding 
gender-intelligent attitudes and having well rounded 
views of society. The Head Master has spoken about this 
publicly, and his most recent interview on the topic can 
be found here. Our Personal, Social and Health Education 

*The Lower Master is Eton’s equivalent of the Deputy Head

curriculum supports this aim and we have appointed a 
Head of Inclusion Education to help ensure that diversity 
is considered in all aspects of school life. We also run 
a number of societies focusing on equality issues, such 
as the Feminism Society, the LGBT Equality Society, and 
the Disability Awareness and Accessibility Society. These 
societies are managed by the boys themselves and are 
forums for debate, dialogue and exploration.

I, the Lord Waldegrave of North Hill, Provost of Eton 
College, confirm that the information contained within 
this statement is accurate.
