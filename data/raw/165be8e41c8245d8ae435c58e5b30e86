Gender Pay Lucchini Unipart Rail Ltd 
 
Lucchini Unipart Rail Ltd (LUR) is required to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the Equality Act 
2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.  This involves carrying out calculations that 
show the difference between the average earnings of  men and women in  our organisation.  The 
current reporting period is 6th April 2016 to 5th April 2017. 
 
The results identify: 

  The difference in mean and median pay and bonus levels 
  The balance of male and female employees 

 
The  challenge  in  any  organisation  is  to  minimise  the  gender  pay  gap  and  the  Directors  of  LUR 
recognise they must strive to build a balanced and diverse workforce. 
 
The Directors are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across 
the  company.   However,  our  industry  and  our business  (heavy  engineering  in the  rail  sector) are 
characterised by a significant imbalance between male and female employees.  This divergence is 
particularly marked amongst our production teams that represent the highest number of employees.  
LUR  will  continue  to  do  all  it  can  to  attract  women  into  the  business,  whilst  recognising  that 
nationally, less than 10% of the engineering workforce is female (The Institute of Engineering and 
Technology).
