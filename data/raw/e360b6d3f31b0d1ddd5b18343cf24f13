Although not a matter of concern, there is some disparity and the organisation will continue to address areas where this occurs.  The mean gender pay gap is greater than the median pay gap. This suggests that although the ranges of pay are spread fairly equally between men and women there is a higher proportion of men that receive the very highest levels of pay. This said, in terms of the top quartile of pay, there is a higher proportion of women than men. The organisation considers itself to be supportive of development opportunities for women and recognises the complex needs of its employees through the practical application of supportive working practices and policies.  The two middle quartiles of pay are the areas that show the most disparity; the upper middle quartile showing more male employees and the lower middle quartile showing more women employees. Although over-simplistic, the pay groupings may define a split between “middle management” jobs and “technical support” jobs. There is scope to improve the proportion of women to be appointed or move upwards into the higher of the two bands. Practical measures to support such moves include the adoption of flexible working practices through change of policy and the commencement of an active apprenticeship programme that offers training to level three qualifications and beyond.  The proportion of men and women in the lower quartile is broadly similar although women do occupy a higher proportion of posts. Many of the jobs towards the lower end of pay scales are unskilled posts and part-time posts. The organisation does offer opportunity for training to upskill its workforce and to encourage upward movement of its staff. However, as the organisation flattens its structure in response to budgetary pressures and the continued implementation of technology the opportunities for promotion out of the lower pay quartile will become less frequent. In wider society it is still often women that undertake care responsibilities which might make part-time working more attractive even though flexible working practice are applied to many better-paid posts in the organisation. Internal review was recently undertaken to build into process, the formal consideration of whether such flexible working practices can be applied to any new vacancy as it arises.
