GENDER PAY GAP REPORT
MARCH 2018

INTRODUCTION

At Everest we believe in promoting equality and diversity amongst our workforce.  As such, we welcome the 
opportunity to publish the information required under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) 
regulations 2017 that shows gender pay gap levels within our business.

The statutory reporting information were compiled using the standard methodologies set out in the Regulations 
based on the ‘snapshot date’ of 5 April 2017, with reference to the ACAS guidelines where appropriate. 

GENDER PAY GAP

34%

26%

The above shows the gap between the average pay of men is greater than the average pay for women within 
our organisation.

The gender pay gap is not about equal pay for men and women doing the same job. It is about calculating the 
difference in average earnings. The gender pay gap looks at all jobs, all levels and all salaries within the 
organisation.

Improving our gender balance and closing our gender pay gap is important to Everest but this is historically a 
male-dominated industry in which our recruitment activity attracts predominantly males.

This data shows the male to female split of our workforce in each pay quartile. It was established by ranking 
the whole workforce in order of hourly pay from lowest to highest and then dividing them into four equally 
sized pay quartile groups from the payroll listing, following which the proportions of men and women in each 
of the quartiles were calculated.

The gender split in each of the quartile bands are representative of our overall male to female ratio (blue for 
Male and orange for Female). Traditionally sales and technical roles, in our Industry, have not been an area 
that females have entered when selecting a career however we see at the lower end of the quartile there are 
a higher percentage of females in more flexible office based roles.

What Are We Going to Do?

Our analysis tells us that the under-representation of women is the main driver for our gender pay gap. 
There are no quick wins to closing the gap however over the coming 12 months we will be looking at: -

· Our recruitment strategy to attract females into under-represented roles;

· Shortlist candidates to achieve gender balance and diversity where we can;

· Invest more in supporting and progressing our female talent into more senior roles;
