O V E R V I E W

H arrods Aviation is a business that 

believes in promoting good working 
practices and inclusive policies. We pride 
ourselves on the principles of fairness  
and equality in all that we do, and pay  
is no exception.

We have welcomed this opportunity to 
acknowledge where we are as a business 
in terms of gender-balanced pay, both in 
terms of our achievements to date and 
the improvements that need to be made. 

Harrods Aviation is currently reporting a 
median pay gap of 18 per cent. While we 
acknowledge that work needs to be done 
to improve the levels of recruitment of 
women across the business – including for 
senior roles – there are two factors that 
should be taken into consideration when 
analysing this figure. 

The figures shown by the report include 
roles within Harrods Aviation like aircraft 
handling services and aircraft fuelling 

that have traditionally attracted a far 
greater number of male applicants. 
While we actively promote internal and 
external female applicants for these 
roles, and treat all applicants equally, 
regardless of gender, there continues to 
be a small number of departments where 
there are currently no female employees. 

If the departments in which there are no 
female employees (engineering, aircraft 
handling and fuelling) are excluded from 
the data, the median pay gap for roles in 
which there are both male and female 
employees falls to –0.7 per cent (and the 
mean pay gap also falls to –0.7 per cent).

Secondly, we promote, where at all 
feasible, a flexible working programme 
across the organisation – in part to 
support employees with families. This 
results in 31 per cent of our employees 
working either part-time or as part of 
a job-share agreement. As 84 per cent 

of this group is female, this flexible 
working programme impacts salaries 
disproportionately among female 
employees – which is also reflected  
in the figures. 

Building a sustainable, diverse and 
representative workforce is integral 
for any long-term business strategy. In 
the areas and divisions where Harrods 
Aviation is currently demonstrating a 
gender deficit, specifically in the technical 
roles that remain male-dominated on an 
industry-wide level, we will continue to 
develop new ways of working to recruit 
and promote a more balanced workforce. 
This includes reviewing our company 
policies, procedures and recruitment,  
to ensure we offer an equal opportunity 
at all levels of our business, regardless  
of gender.
