The data for Richmond Fellowship is as follows:  Gender Pay Gap The difference between the full time equivalent average earnings of men and women. This is expressed as a percentage of men’s earnings.  Mean gender pay gap = 5.93% Median gender pay gap = 0.00%  Gender Bonus Gap The difference between the full time equivalent average bonuses of men and women.  Mean bonus gender pay gap = not applicable (as bonuses are not paid) Median bonus gender pay gap = not applicable (as bonuses are not paid) Percentage who receive a bonus = not applicable (as bonus are not paid)  Quartiles Proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure.  Lower quartile = 80% female and 20% male Lower middle quartile = 64% female and 36% male Upper middle quartile = 66% female and 34% male Upper quartile = 71% female and 29% male  Commentary from Derek Caren, Group Chief Executive  The mean gender pay gap for the whole economy (according to the October 2017 Office for National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings figures) is 17.4%, while in the Not for Profit sector it is 19.4%.  At 5.93%, Richmond Fellowship’s mean gender pay gap is therefore significantly lower than for the whole economy and for our sector. The quartile figures demonstrate that we have more women than men across all four quartiles and this can perhaps be explained due to the sector that we are in.  Analysis of our data suggests that the 5.93% pay gap that we do have arises as a result of positions held in the upper quartile. However out of our top five most senior positions, two of these (40%) were filled by woman as at 5 April 2017.  As an organisation we are committed to equality and there are no differences in pay rates for different genders occupying equivalent roles. Our pay policy states that we pay employees equally for the same or equivalent work regardless of their sex (or any other protected characteristic as defined in the Equality Act 2010).  We will continue to ensure that our external and internal recruitment processes are fair and consistent. In addition we will continue to undertake wider diversity monitoring e.g. workforce representation and training attendance by diversity groups as part of our wider commitment under our Investors in Diversity accreditation.
