GENDER PAY GAP

The Crownlea Group is an employer required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting under the 
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. This involves carrying out six 
calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our 
organisation.

We can use these results to assess:

•   the levels of gender equality in our workplace
•   the balance of male and female employees at different levels
•   how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded

The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap so I am 
pleased to report The Crownlea Group’s ﬁgures as follows:

Difference in hourly rate of pay – mean -1.1%
Difference in hourly rate of pay – median 0.2%
Difference in bonus pay – mean 78.4%
Difference in bonus pay – median -120.0%
Percentage of employees who received bonus pay – male 33.2% female 10.3%

Employees by pay quartile:

   Upper quartile male 75.8% female 24.2%
   Upper middle quartile male 77.6% female 22.4%
   Lower middle quartile male 75.8% female 24.2%
   Lower quartile male 77.3% female 22.7%

As an Equal Opportunities employer the above ﬁgures reinforce the Board’s commitment of 
maintaining gender equality across the Group.

Bonus payments are all performance related and paid strictly in relation to each individual employee’s 
performance regardless of gender, race, religion, age or disability.

The above ﬁgures have been internally audited and veriﬁed as accurate.
