Our 2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

At Acheson & Acheson we are committed to creating an inclusive working environment based on fairness, 
equality and respect.

Our Gender Pay Gap report responds to new Government legislation that came in to force in April 2017, 
stipulating that all companies based in England, Scotland or Wales that have more than 250 employees 
must report their gender pay gap and bonus gaps as they are on 5th April each year.

The gender pay gap is defined as the difference in the average earnings of men and women over a standard 
period of time, regardless of their role or seniority. 

Often, the gender pay gap is confused with unequal pay, though this is a different measurement. Unequal 
pay is when one gender is paid less than the other for the same work.  We are confident that men and 
women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business.

The following table shows our overall mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay at the 
snapshot date of 5th April 2017.  It also illustrates the mean and median difference between bonuses paid 
to men and women in the year up to 5th April 2017.

All eligible employees received a bonus 
payment.

A significantly higher proportion of our 
female employees work in part time 
roles. Whilst this bears no impact on 
hourly rates, it does impact bonus 
payments calculated as a percentage
of earnings.
