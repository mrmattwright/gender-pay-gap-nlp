INTRO
Leicester City’s 2017 Gender Pay 
Report outlines the difference in 
average hourly pay of men and 
women throughout the Football 
Club – its Gender Pay Gap – along 
with some of the factors that 
contribute to it and the Club’s long-
term commitment to promoting pay 
equality throughout its operation.

THE DATA EXPLAINED
In order to place its Gender Pay 
Report into accurate context, the 
Club has prepared two sets of data to 
clarify the potentially distorting effect 
of players’ salaries on the overall 
figures. The report contains median 
and mean figures including players’ 
salaries, plus median and mean 
figures without the players’ salaries. 
The same process has been applied 
to calculations of both bonus pay 
and pay quartiles.

MEDIAN AND MEAN FIGURES
The median figure is reached 
through calculating the percentage 
difference between the halfway 
point in the men’s pay scale and the 
halfway point in the women’s pay 
scale – providing a figure closest 
to what the majority of the Club’s 
employees earn.

The mean figure is the percentage 
difference in average hourly rates 
between men and women and is 
impacted by the distribution of men 
and women in an organisation’s pay 
scale. It is also the number most easily 
distorted by a relatively small number 
of higher earners, such as professional 
footballers.

All members of LCFC staff (100%) are 
eligible for bonuses, irrespective of gender, 
after completing a qualification period. 
If all bonus qualification periods and the 
GPG reporting period were synchronised, 
both numbers above would be 100%.

Bonus structures allocated to First Team 
players, manager, management and 
support staff – roles historically filled by 
men – are designed to incentivise on-pitch 
success and are larger than the standard 
bonuses paid to all staff, leading to a 
differential in mean bonuses paid.

PAY QUARTILES 
The following figures show the percentage of men and women in each of the Club’s 
pay quartiles. These are calculated by dividing our combined pay scale into four equal-
sized groups and determining the percentage of men and women in each.
