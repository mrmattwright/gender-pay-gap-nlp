Customers are at the heart of everything we do every day, and we constantly review what we produce and how we do it to ensure we remain ahead. We have continued to progress our Corporate and Social Responsibility aims, particularly around supporting our employees and giving back to the communities we serve. Over the past 12 months we have also further reduced our environmental impact, and introduced policies around labour standards, human rights and anti-corruption policies throughout our business and supply chain. With these and other measures, we believe we are continuing to make a positive impact on our customers world-wide, the communities we live in and serve, and our people.  Increasing energy efficiency and re-cycling We have a policy across all existing and new buildings to work with our landlords to ensure installation of energy efficient low temperature hot water, low energy lighting and low power technology. As a business, Ascential encourages recycling in all its forms.  Waste recycling Ascential encourages recycling in all its forms and works closely with our facilities management company and landlords to highlight any and all initiatives. In 2016, the London-based business recycled 90 tonnes of material, including 16 tonnes of general waste and 34 tonnes of mixed paper. This is an increase over 2015 and 2014 and was recognised with a “most improved recycler” award in 2016 from one of our building landlords.  Air travel As an increasingly global business, Ascential carefully monitors and aims to manage our air travel effectively. The level of business travel by air is partly explained by the need to visit the United States increasingly frequently, following the move of the WGSN headquarters to New York in 2014, and the acquisition of US brands - Money20/20 in 2014; Retail Net Group in 2015, One Click Retail in 2016 and MediaLink in 2017. The company continues to encourage the use of video conference facilities and webinars as much as possible so as to remove any unnecessary travel.  Where possible, the business encourages business use of trains rather than cars. In the UK, we reduced the number of company cars to 27.  Greenhouse gas emissions statement Ascential is required to measure and report its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by the Companies Act 2006. We are required to disclose the company’s emission of carbon dioxide (equivalence) as well as CO2 intensity value while stating the methodology used to calculate these emissions. As a result, we measure our annual emissions in relation to our revenue as this is the key indicator of our growth. The table below includes both combustion of fuel and purchased electricity and gas associated with our offices.       2016  Unit      Scope 1 * Scope 2 ** Absolute carbon emissions (tCO2)  73.4 793.2 866.6  Tonnes of CO2e Tonnes of CO2e Tonnes of CO2e    Intensity factors: • Total area • Total headcount   17,989 1612   Square metres Full time equivalence (FTE)    Carbon intensity (area)  48.17  Kg of CO2e per m2    Carbon intensity (headcount) ***  538.27  Kg of CO2e per FTE            Year on year change (n/a)         * Scope 1 emissions are from fuel used in company-leased vehicles and are calculated using the distance-based calculation method (DEFRA GHG conversion factors 2016). Emissions from personal or privately-hired vehicles used for company business are considered to be Scope 3 (GHG protocol) and are not included following the ‘Operational control’ boundary approach (see Methodology and scope).  ** Scope 2 emissions are from the consumption of energy at Ascential offices and does not include approximately 40 home workers. CO2 figures are based upon the energy consumption of approx. 84% of Ascential’s operations (using office surface area) with estimates for the remainder. Where the consumption of energy other than electricity (eg natural gas) is supplied as part of a leased building’s SLA and is not available, this information has not been included in the data.  *** Scope 3 does not include approximately 40 home workers.  Methodology and scope Carbon Dioxide equivalence emissions data has been collected, calculated, consolidated and analysed following the GHG Protocol (Corporate Accounting & Reporting Standard) and DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidelines (2013) following the ‘operational control’ approach. The boundary for reporting extends to include all entities and facilities that are owned or leased by Ascential and are also actively managed by Ascential.  Timeframe and future reporting As this is the first year of reporting CO2e emissions following our IPO last year, only data for 2016 has been shown. In future, year over year emission figures will be given. Furthermore, Ascential intends to review its environmental data management process with a view to continuing to improve data accuracy and disclosure going forward.  Behaving ethically throughout our supply chain For Ascential our suppliers, partners and other third parties involved in the provision of goods or services to us are important. They underpin our ability to serve our customers through market-leading exhibitions, festivals and information services. While delivering these valued and trusted products, it is important to us that we and our suppliers do business responsibly, ethically and lawfully and in accordance with our code of conduct.  Third Party Code of Conduct Any third parties involved in the provision of goods and services to Ascential underpin our ability to serve our customers through market-leading exhibitions, festivals and information services. While delivering these valued and trusted products, it is important to us that we and our suppliers do business responsibly, ethically and lawfully. To specify the minimum standards that Ascential expects and requires of third parties, we have created a Code of Conduct which we expect our third parties to adhere to at all times.  Ascential Third Party Code of Conduct  Gender pay reporting at Ascential Government legislation now dictates that all companies in the UK with more than 250 employees must publish a set of agreed metrics that show the difference in the average pay of men and women. This is not the same as ‘equal pay’, which ensures that men and women must get paid the same or similar salary for the same job.  Ascential’s UK mean differential is 15.3%, and our median differential is 21.3% (as at 5 April 2017). Our mean differential is better than the UK national average (17.4%) but we know this isn’t good enough and there is clearly still work to be done. From examining the data, we can see that we have a smaller proportion of women in senior roles than we do at other levels in the company, and we need to address that.  We’re working to build a more inclusive workplace via supportive policies for returning parents, building our diverse talent pipeline and launching unconscious bias training globally, amongst other initiatives. One key way that we’ll be working to close the gap is via our Women in Leadership steering group, chaired by Carla Buzasi, MD, WGSN. Their first step will be to interrogate the data and talk to the business to understand where we need to focus.
