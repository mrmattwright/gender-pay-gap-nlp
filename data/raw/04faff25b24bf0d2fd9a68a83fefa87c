Wave - Keeping generations active, across the generations.     The Wave Story So Far....               Welcome from Wave's CEO            “Our Purpose and Vision have, and continue to act as, the benchmark for everything we do.  “Whilst we continue to invest and drive standards within leisure centres and Newhaven Fort, our priority areas are increasing participation, reducing health equalities and improving accessibility and social inclusion. We achieve this by creating great opportunities for people of all ages and ability levels to live active lifestyles whilst making every effort to minimise our impact on the environment.  “During 2016/2017 we started our gym refurbishment programme across our four main sites in Lewes, Seaford, Peacehaven and Newhaven. As part of this programme, we have brought the latest technology and entertainment to our gym floors, via the new Life Fitness cardiovascular, pin selector and free weights equipment.  “In addition, at the Downs Leisure Centre in Seaford, we introduced the latest body statistical analysis technology – boditrax™. This system ensures our customers can obtain immediate personalised precision body composition results which include bone density, muscle mass, fat percentage, visceral fat and hydration levels, along with metabolic age.  “boditrax™ has also enabled us to add significant value to our new GP Referral Programme called ‘MoveMore’. MoveMore is designed to support those in greatest need with the relevant support mechanisms to lead more active lifestyles. We work across a range of sectors including Sport and Activity, Education, Public Health and Adult Social Care, helping people of all ages and ability levels to be active, how they want, where they want, when they want.”                 Wave's Centres             Downs Leisure Centre  More details       East Grinstead Sports Club  More details       Lewes Leisure Centre  More details       Peacehaven Leisure Centre  More details             Ringmer Swimming Pool  More details       Seaford Head Swimming Pool  More details       Seahaven Swim & Fitness Centre  More details       Shakespeare Hall, Newhaven  More details             Join Now      Max  Wave's  'MAX' Membership gives you great value for money with NO joining fee and a discounted monthly rate for your 12-month commitment to fitness.
