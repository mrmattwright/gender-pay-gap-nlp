Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

take time, there is much we can and are doing to drive 
improvements.
This report, while focused specifically on meeting the 
government’s gender pay gap reporting requirements, 
is therefore part of a much wider effort to improve the 
diversity of our business. Some examples of our activities     
are included at the end of this report.
I confirm the data reported is accurate.

As a business we are committed to providing an inclusive and open culture for all our people. Indeed, 
creating a more diverse workforce so that we draw on different skills and perspectives to improve 
the advice we offer clients is a key part of our strategy to 2020. 
Gender diversity is an important part of our strategy and 
we welcome the government’s gender pay gap initiative 
as a way to drive further analysis and action across the 
profession. 
At TLT, we are proud of our strong female 
representation across the business and of our ongoing 
work to build a culture that embraces flexible working 
and values a healthy work life balance. But, we 
recognise that there is still much to do particularly in 
terms of our diversity at a senior level. 
Many of our challenges are familiar across the industry 
and we are committed to work towards greater 
diversity across the business. Although change will 
Gender pay
To encourage employers to make efforts to narrow the 
gender pay gap, any organisation with more than 250 
employees must now publish their gender pay gap. The 
gender pay gap is the difference between the average 
gross hourly earnings for all men and the average gross 
hourly earnings for all women employees within an 
organisation.
To comply with gender pay reporting there are three key 
areas of focus:
1.  The percentage difference in male and female hourly 

This report looks at a snapshot of pay data at TLT on 5 
April 2017 and for bonuses awarded during the 12 months 
prior to that date. The regulatory requirements mean that 
partners are not included in this gender pay gap report. 
We do however recognise that improving our gender 
balance at partner level is one of our key challenges and 
we will continue to take action in this area.

The difference between the gender pay gap 
and equal pay
It is worth clarifying that “gender pay” is not the same thing 
as “equal pay”. Gender pay is about comparing the average 
pay of all female staff against the average pay of all male 
staff across an organisation as a whole, regardless of the 
individual jobs performed. 
Equal pay is about the individual pay of men and women 
who are carrying out the same or equivalent jobs. We are 
confident from our regular internal monitoring that we fully 
comply with equal pay legalisation.

rate on a mean and median basis.

2.  The percentage difference in bonus paid to men 
and women on a mean and median basis, and 
what proportion of the male and female workforce 
are paid a bonus.

3.  The proportion of men and women that sit in each pay 

quartile.

Pay quartiles
The government requires employers to split their 
workforce into four pay quartiles and then report 
on the proportion of men and women that sit in 
each of those pay quartiles. This is effectively the 
total number of employees at TLT split into four 

equal categories of pay – so the bottom 25% 
of earners, the next 25% of earners and so on.

Understanding our gender pay gap

Our analysis shows that there are four primary drivers of 
our firm gender and bonus pay gap:
n  Overall we have a predominately female workforce 

at TLT. However, we have a higher proportion of 
men in higher paying roles whilst the majority of our 
administrative and junior roles are female dominated. 

n  In employee fee earner roles there is less of a gender 
pay gap, with the bonus pay gap marginally in favour 
of women. But, in business support, the most senior 
roles are held by male employees with a high level of 
contingent pay based on results, which contributes to 
the bonus pay gap. 

n  There are a greater proportion of women working 
part time at TLT compared to men. In the year to 5 
April 2017, 27% of women were on part time hours 
compared to 6% of men, this impacts the bonus gap. 
With regards to bonus payments, under the reporting 
rules there is no allowance for the fact that bonuses 

are reduced pro rata for part time staff. Indeed, 25% of 
females receiving a bonus worked part time and would 
therefore have received a pro rated bonus.  All of the 
men receiving a bonus worked full time and would 
therefore receive the whole amount. Although part 
time working has an impact on the overall firm bonus 
gap, we believe the ability of so many of our staff to 
work flexibly is a positive, particularly in the context of 
addressing the gender balance over the longer term.
n  There are some specific rules around reporting salary 

values. Although salary sacrifice offers potentially 
larger savings e.g. childcare vouchers, they do impact 
the gender pay gap. Analysis shows that women at 
TLT are more likely to choose flexible benefits with a 
higher average contribution rate than men. Over 200 
women took advantage of our childcare vouchers in 
the 12 months to 5 April 2017 compared to 33 men.

‘Reporting and analysing our pay and 
reward by gender is an important part of 
our commitment to attract and retain a more 
diverse workforce at TLT.’

What are we doing?

Reporting and analysing our pay and reward by gender is 
an important part of our commitment to attract and retain a 
more diverse workforce at TLT. This programme includes a 
wide range of activities to remove barriers to progression. 
We already have a number of initiatives underway to 
improve our diversity as a business. Some recent examples 

are outlined in the section below. Although the nature of 
these efforts means that progress will be gradual, we will 
continue to review our efforts, focus and progress towards 
achieving our goals.
                                                                                                   

Recruitment

We regularly review our recruitment 
practices to remove or reduce 
unconscious bias. For example:
n  Running recruitment workshops 

for hiring managers to ensure best 
practice.
Instructing our recruitment agencies 
to focus on delivering gender 
balanced shortlists.

n 

n  Transparent recruitment processes.
n  Action and events to support 
access to the legal profession 
from all backgrounds through 
affiliation with the Legal Social 
Mobility Partnership, PRIME and 
Aspiring Solicitors.

                                                                     
                                                        

                                                              
Training
n  Providing training via e-learning in 
areas such as unconscious bias 
and dignity at work.

n  Achieving Silver Investors in 

People status, which requires 
successful organisations to have 
a strategy in place to support 
the development and inclusion 
of all employees.

Flexible working and leave
n  Promoting a variety of flexible 

working options. 

n  Enhanced maternity leave support 

for eligible employees.

n  Supporting parents with 

enhanced Shared Parental  
Leave pay.

Reward
 n  Auditing of annual pay reviews to 
ensure that men and women are 
paid equally for doing equivalent jobs 
across the business, unless there is 
a non-gender related explanation.
