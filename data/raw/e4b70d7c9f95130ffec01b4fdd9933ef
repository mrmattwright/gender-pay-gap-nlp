This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation. It does not involve publishing individual employees’ data.  It is essential to distinguish between equal pay and a gender pay gap.  In general, equal pay issues may arise in an organisation if that organisation pays men and women at different rates for doing the same work or work of equal value.  The Burhill Group of companies do not differentiate between rates of pay for employees working within job roles based on the gender of the employees working within those roles.  The concept of the Gender Pay Gap a much broader concept which compares the average earnings of men and women regardless of their role within an organisation.  The difference is expressed as the percentage difference between men and women.
