I want to foster an inclusive environment where different voices are encouraged and heard, enabling our people to perform at their best. As is the case in many organisations, the proportion of women in senior roles at Aggreko is lower than we would like, making our gender pay gap greater than we would want it to be. Addressing it is both the right thing to do and good for our business. Whilst there are understandable reasons why we find ourselves here, there can be no excuses for failing to deal with it. I am absolutely committed to ensuring fairness and equality among our workforce.”  Chris Weston Chief Executive Officer  Read our 2017 gender pay gap report                   You may also be interested in...
