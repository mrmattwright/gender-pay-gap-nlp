Across the Group, we recognise the value in diversity as a key differentiator. As such, we are committed to actively and aggressively reducing our gender pay gap.  At the data snapshot date of 5 April 2017, two of the Group’s U.K. subsidiary companies had greater than 250 employees:    Luxfer Gas Cylinders Limited, and    Magnesium Elektron Limited.    Separate Gender Pay Gap Reports for these companies can be found via clicking the relevant link below. In addition, the Group presents a separate report for its entire U.K. employee base under the name of its parent Company, Luxfer Holdings PLC. This can be accessed by clicking on the relevant link below. Overall, we believe the hiring of Heather Harding as Chief Financial Officer in January 2018 demonstrates the Group’s value in diversity and commitment to shortening its global gender pay gap.
