Background 

From April 2017 under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) 
Regulations 2017 employers with 250 or more employees are required to publish 
statutory gender pay gap calculations every year.  

The data must be a salary snapshot as at 31 March 2017.  This report sets out the 
figures that Cherwell District Council (CDC) are required to publish with an analysis 
of the information.  

This information will be published on the CDC website for a minimum of 3 years and 
published on the government website (gov.uk) by 30 March 2018. 

Equal pay and gender pay gap 

The purpose of gender pay gap reporting is to achieve greater gender equality in 
terms of pay across the UK and increase pay transparency. This differs from equal 
pay which deals with differences between men and women who carry out the same 
roles. 

Details within this report 

Using a snapshot of employees and their pay as at 31 March 2017, 6 calculations 
were required to be completed that outline the earnings of both men and women 
across CDC. 

The calculations that have been completed are as follows: 

1.  Mean gender pay gap 
2.  Median gender pay gap 
3.  Mean bonus gender pay gap 
4.  Median bonus gender pay gap 
5.  The proportion of men and women receiving a bonus payment 
6.  The proportion of men and women divided into four quartile pay bands

Gender pay gap as at 31 March 2017 

Mean: average hourly rate of pay and percentage difference 

           

                     Gap: 3.25%, £0.50 per hour               

     

                                                

         £15.58                                           

 

  

 

 £15.08 

Based on the required criteria; a calculation of the data shows that as at 31 March 
2017 the mean pay for men was £15.58 per hour and for women was £15.08 per 
hour.  This equates to an additional 3.25% for men.  

The mean difference recorded at CDC is 14.45% less than the national public sector 
mean pay gap which is 17.7% (Office for National Statistics – ASHE). 

Median: middle hourly rate of pay and percentage difference 

 

                      Gap: 6.89%, £0.98 per hour 

           

                                                 

        £14.22                                               

 

 

 

 £13.24 

The median pay for men was £14.22 at 31 March 2018, compared to £13.24 for 
women.  This means that men earned an average of £0.98 per hour more than 
women, which equates to a median difference of 6.89%. 

The median difference recorded at CDC is 12.51% less than the national public 
sector median pay gap which is 19.4% (Office for National Statistics – ASHE). 

Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses 

CDC does not operate any performance related pay or bonus schemes and therefore 
has no bonus gender pay gap.

Pay quartiles 

CDC employed 512 people as at 31 March 2017 which means there are 128 
employees per pay quartile.  The gender split per quartile is detailed below.  

The hourly rates that represent each quartile are as follows: 

  Lower - relates to the hourly rates up to £11.57 
  Lower middle - relates to the hourly rates of £11.57 - £13.80   
  Upper middle - relates to the hourly rates of £13.80 – £17.56 
  Upper - relates to the hourly rates of £17.56 and above 

 

  

         Men: 51.56%  

    Women: 48.44%  

 

 

         Men: 48.44%

       Men: 55.47% 

  Women: 44.53% 

   

 

 

       Men: 47.66% 

  Women: 52.34%

There are a higher proportion of men in the upper and upper middle quartiles; with 
the highest difference recorded in the upper middle quartile where the workforce 
breakdown for this category shows almost 5.5% more men than women. 

Overall within CDC our mean, median and quartile findings are positive, reflecting a 
balanced gender pay gap report within our workforce. With our overall workforce 
split between men and women as 51:49; this serves as a useful benchmark by which 
to compare each pay quartile. 

CDC operate a robust job evaluation process and this is apparent through the fact 
that the highest difference in any quartile is 5.5%.  We will ensure that job grades 
continue to be determined through objective analysis and job evaluation to maintain 
the integrity of the pay and grading system. 

Family friendly policies and flexible working ensures that CDC can both attract and 
retain staff in a competitive job market and in a geographical area with low 
unemployment. 

The gender pay gap data will be analysed on an annual basis and a comparison of 
figures will be completed year on year.  The Senior Management Team will continue 
to review and monitor this data.
