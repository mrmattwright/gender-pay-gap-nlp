GENDER PAY REPORT 
2017

WHAT IS GENDER PAY GAP 
REPORTING?

Gender Pay Gap reporting 
seeks to explain the 
difference in the pay 
of male and female 
employees, according to 
a series of measures as 
defined by UK Government.

What measures must be reported?
From April 2017, organisations with over 250 employees 
must report:
• The difference in the Mean and Median Pay of Male  and

Female employees - The Gender Pay Gap

• The difference in the Mean and Median Bonus Pay of Male

and Female employees - The Gender Bonus Pay Gap
• The proportion of Male and Female employees who

receive a Bonus

• The percentage of Male and Female employees in each

Pay Quartile

What is Mean Pay?
We add together the 
hourly pay for all male 
employees, then divide 
by the number of male 
employees. We do the 
same for all female 
employees and then 
compare the average (or 
mean) hourly pay.*

What is Median Pay?
We rank all male employees in order of their hourly 
pay. We do the same for all female employees, and 
then compare the pay of the “middle female” and the 
“middle male”.*

What is a Pay Quartile?
We rank the workforce from lowest to highest paid, then split into four equal groups (quartiles), and state the 
percentage of men and women in each group.

The percentage of Male 
and Female employees in 
each Pay Quartile

The higher mean and median pay for female employees reﬂects 
their distribution in our organisation; within the smaller female 
population, we see proportionately more women in non-production 
and managerial roles. 

The bonus payments included in the analysis range from ﬁxed 
amount recognition awards through to corporate bonus payments for 
middle and senior management.
During the period in question, the majority of bonus payments were 
in the form of various recognition awards, with a slightly higher 
proportion of the female population receiving such an award.

The Mean bonus gap is explained by the higher proportion of male 
employees in the most senior management positions.
The Median bonus gap can be explained by the variations in relatively 
low value payments associated with various recognition awards and 
schemes.

The female representation is slightly higher in the Upper Pay 
Quartiles, with the highest level of representation in the Upper 
Quartile, reﬂecting the fact that the highest proportion of female 
employees are in our management population.

GO FURTHER 

At Ford we are committed to the 
equality of opportunity. We recognise 
the signiﬁcant value men and women 
bring to the workplace and the beneﬁts 
of a gender balanced workforce. 
Our Gender Pay Report is positive 
for us in many respects, but also 
highlights the challenges we face in 
our organisation and our industry, 
speciﬁcally in relation to improving 
female representation. As we outline 
here, it emphasises the importance 
of our current initiatives and steers 
our focus to achieve a more gender 
balanced workforce across, and at all 
levels, of our organisation.   

• Offering work experience, taster opportunities and

career days

Particularly in support of encouraging more female 
students to engage in STEM we: 
• Run dedicated events such as “IT Girls Day” and

“International Women in Engineering Day”

• Ensure our STEM Ambassadors include female role

models

• Support school careers advice events, highlighting

the successes of our female apprentices

• Celebrate the contribution of young women in

the UK by running an annual competition which
recognises and rewards the achievements of an
inspiring female STEM undergraduate who uses her
skills to inspire the next generation

Whilst we have been able to achieve a more balanced 
representation of male and female employees in 
a number of our commercial functions, our female 
representation particularly in engineering and 
manufacturing activities continues to challenge us,  
as well as many other organisations immersed in 
these sectors. 
In the UK, women make up only 1 in 8 of those in 
engineering occupations1. Consequently, investing 
in the Talent of the Future is central to our desire to 
achieve a more gender-balanced workforce. 
We are committed to sharing our engineering passion 
and expertise across the UK to inspire and encourage 
the next generation of engineers by:
• Forming positive ongoing partnerships with schools, 

colleges and universities via initiatives which
enhance the teaching and learning experience of
Science Technology Engineering Mathematics
(STEM) subjects with real life applications

• Utilising our resources and facilities to support

competitive and fun engineering challenges such
as the Greenpower Trust, Formula Goblins and
Formula 24 competitions, as well as First Lego
League events

GO FURTHER 

Within our organisation, we seek to provide an 
environment that enables all our employees to fully 
realise their potential. As part of our efforts to achieve 
improved levels of Female Representation in more 
senior levels of our organisation we:    
• Utilise our network of Diversity Councils to

drive diversity and inclusion actions across our
business areas

• Undertake regular reviews of leadership career and
development plans, with particular attention to our
female talent

• Continue to roll-out inclusive training activities e.g. 

unconscious bias awareness

• Effectively engage in our external partnership with

the International Women of Excellence, which offers
regular female focused development interventions
and external networking opportunities

• Celebrate the value of women in our business by

supporting and encouraging a series of recognition
events including International Women’s Day and
International Women in Engineering Day

• Recognising the value of extensive peer to peer

networks, for example our Parenting Network and
Carers Network

We are currently seeking to identify ways to better 
attract a more balanced take-up of ﬂexible working 
opportunities, complementing our efforts associated 
with workforce agility.
In positioning ourselves as a Female Employer 
of Choice, we also offer a best in class maternity 
policy underpinned by maternity advisors, parenting 
workshops, and enhanced pay provisions. 
As part of our desire to lead in best practice in this 
area, we are a founding member of the Equality 
and Human Rights Commission’s Working Forward 
Initiative.

Additionally, over the next cycle, and responding to 
trends identiﬁed in the report, we will be seeking to:
Investigate “returnship” opportunities to increase
•
the pipeline of female talent to senior roles

• Review gender monitoring activities as part of our

2018/2019 Fairness And Inclusion Review

• Build upon a recent pilot using more gender neutral

language in our recruitment literature

We are also aware that ﬂexibility, transparency and 
progressive policies are key enablers to being able to 
retain our employees throughout the various stages of 
their lives. We seek to do this by:
• Having a progressive ﬂexible working policy that
offers men and women a range of ways to work.
95% of our employees taking maternity leave return
to work with us, and our ﬂexible working policies are
a key element in this success. Most recently we have
been recognised by Timewise for senior job sharing
opportunities and shortlisted by WorkingMums for
Innovation in Flexible Working

• Providing on-site crèche facilities at our biggest

UK location

“Diversity and inclusion are 
fundamental parts of our business 
strategy and are key to enabling our 
business to connect and grow in a 
way that supports our employees, 
suppliers and customers.
We recognise the beneﬁts of a gender 
balanced workforce, within our 
organisation and our industry, and 
we value the new Gender Pay Gap 
reporting elements in focussing our 
on-going efforts to achieve this aim.” 

I conﬁrm that the gender pay gap 
information contained in this report 
is accurate.
