Introduction

Transport is vital in connecting 
communities to jobs, education and 
leisure, while also supporting economic 
growth and personal mobility. 

I support the Government’s legislation 
that organisations with 250 or more 
employees must provide an annual 
gender pay gap report.

Arriva is one of the UK’s largest bus 
operators and provides almost a 
quarter of all rail passenger journeys.

What we do matters, but how we do it 
matters more. That’s why the make-up 
of our workforce is so important: we 
strive to make sure our people represent 
our diverse society and customer base 
and we value their ideas and contributions. 

We have an ambition to become the 
mobility partner of choice, preferred 
by our passengers, partners and 
clients. Having a diverse, talented 
and motivated workforce is key to 
achieving that ambition. 

I’m proud of our culture, but I know that 
we still have a long way to go before our 
workforce fully represents the diversity 
of society and our customer base.

Arriva operates 21 businesses in the 
UK which employ 250 or more people. 
The average of the mean pay gap 
across these businesses is 7% due  
to a gender imbalance within our senior 
management population. It’s a legacy 
of an industry that’s struggled over  
the decades to attract women. 

This report outlines some of our 
initiatives we have put in place to 
improve gender balance and equality, 
while helping us continue to deliver  
high quality services to our customers.

Our 2017 gender pay gap reportOverview: gender balance 
and equality at Arriva  

Arriva operates many bus and train businesses in the UK, 
and we’re all connected to one set of values. They sum up 
what we stand for and what makes us unique. They foster 
trust and integrity. They encourage diversity of thinking 
and support inclusion. By living these values every day, 
we’ve built a successful business that delivers the very  
best for our customers.

While we have great people working for 
us, we know that we need to do more to 
attract greater numbers of women and 
minority groups to ensure we are fully 
representing the diverse communities 
we serve.

Last year, we doubled our female 
intake of graduates across Arriva  
and invested in two new Apprentice 
Academies to support the professional 
development of our bus engineers. 

We will build on our successes in  
2018 with, for example, the launch  
of our Leadership Academy that  
will make professional development 
programmes even more accessible and 
open up management opportunities 
for our employees.

Identifying talent across our workforce 
and tapping into people’s different 
perspectives is key to Arriva’s continued 
success. By strengthening our Diversity 
and Inclusion policies we will be seeking 
to create an environment where all our 
employees can continue to flourish.

I am absolutely committed to making 
sure everyone has an equal and fair 
chance of progression within Arriva.

Group Director of 
Corporate Affairs

different perspectives 
is key to Arriva’s

Our 2017 gender pay gap reportGender pay vs equal pay

Although there’s a gender imbalance across 
Arriva, including the senior management 
population, pay is not influenced by gender. 

Arriva supports the fair treatment 
and reward of all staff, irrespective  
of gender.

Equal pay is the measure of whether a 
person of one gender receives less pay 
for carrying out the same, or similar, job. 
It compares the remuneration of individuals 
performing the same, or similar, work. 

The measure of gender pay, on the other 
hand, is much broader. It’s the difference 
between the average earnings of men 
and women over a snapshot of time, 
irrespective of role or seniority.

Nationally, one of the main reasons 
for the gender pay gap is men are more 
likely to be in senior roles. People in those 
more senior roles are also typically eligible 
for bonus payments.

Equal pay...
is men and women being 
paid equally for the same 
or similar work

The gender pay gap...
is the difference between the gross hourly earnings
for all men and the gross hourly earnings for all women

Understanding Arriva’s 
gender pay gap

Our 2017 gender pay data highlights that overall there  
is a gender imbalance within our workforce, particularly 
across our senior management population where men 
make up the majority of those in the most senior and 
therefore highest paid positions. This is the principal 
reason for the gender pay gap across our businesses. 

Men and women have equal opportunities 
and access to, and pay for, roles within  
Arriva. However, more men than women  
take up management, engineering and 
operational roles and this is another 
contributor to the gender pay gap. 
 
The extent of the gender pay bonus  
gap varies across our businesses, with  
a number of reverse bonus pay gaps  
in favour of women. Where the gap is 
significant, it’s often the case that the 
number of individuals in receipt of a bonus  
is low. For these companies, as only a 
relatively small number of employees  
receive a bonus, those in more senior 
positions who receive a larger payment 
substantially influence the bonus pay gap.   
 

As members of the International  
Association of Public Transport, we  
support their recommendations to work 
towards increasing the share of women 
within the industry. While there are no  
quick wins, we are committed to changing 
the way people, particularly women and 
other underrepresented groups, see the 
transport industry and to boosting the 
numbers applying for jobs with Arriva.
 
Through our recruitment practices we will 
continue our efforts to broaden the appeal  
of Arriva to attract a diverse workforce and 
create an environment which supports the 
career development of our employees.

Arriva UKA roadmap to creating 
more gender balance  
and equality at Arriva

We always seek new opportunities to embed our 
values and achieve sustainable business growth. 
We’re committed to continuing our diversity  
journey to create a stronger One Arriva.

Enhanced Diversity 
& Inclusion strategy
Our diversity journey goes beyond gender 
and embraces all types of difference. 

Our ambition to become the mobility partner 
of choice can only be achieved if we embrace 
all aspects of diversity – which will be at the 
heart of our new Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy that we’re developing.

Throughout 2018, we will strengthen our 
internal people processes, including 
recruitment, retention, development and 
promotion, to encourage workplace diversity. 
We will also launch a Diversity and Inclusion 
campaign – One Voice – to celebrate and 
raise awareness of all aspects of diversity 
across Arriva. As part of this, we will carry 
out focus groups to gain insights, particularly 
from minority groups, about what it’s like  
to work at Arriva and develop meaningful 
action plans to support and strengthen 
workplace diversity.

We will also increase our focus on  
developing local community links and 
diversity partnerships to ensure that,  
as a business, we remain able to attract  
the best employees, representative of  
the communities we serve.

Recruitment

Over the past few years, our businesses  
have made huge efforts to cast the 
recruitment net wider and use more  
inclusive materials and gender neutral  
job descriptions to ensure Arriva appeals  
to a much broader demographic. And our  
new and improved people processes will  
help us to better manage and nurture talent.

We are starting to see some success stories.  
Arriva Midlands, for example, has had great 
success in recruiting female engineering 
apprentices whose achievements have 
gained industry recognition. These women 
are acting as positive role models for other 
young people considering a career in transport.

Arriva London has been working closely with 
Unite on a training programme to help recruit 
and train people from the local communities, 
and has partnered with local Job Centres to 
employ long-term unemployed people from 
the locality and train them to be bus drivers. 

07

Our 2017 gender pay gap reportArriva’s Leadership Academy
We believe that by creating a well-balanced, 
more diverse leadership team, we will 
perform better as a business. 

Identifying Arriva-specific leadership 
capabilities, against which all leaders  
will be assessed, will ensure transparency  
and help us to continue to select and  
promote candidates for leadership  
roles, irrespective of gender.

In addition, the Leadership Academy we are 
introducing will create an even more dynamic 
environment for career development and 
opportunities for all leaders. 

Nurturing future talent 
Changing perceptions about the transport 
industry to make it more attractive to 
women and minority groups won’t happen 
overnight. However, we are committed  
to boosting the numbers of people with 
different backgrounds, education, ethnicity 
and gender applying for jobs at Arriva.   

Our international Graduate Programme 
attracts some of the brightest talent.  
In 2017, 19 graduates completed their  
training programme and took up exciting 
management positions at Arriva, while  
a further 32 graduates were recruited  
into the programme (with twice as  
many female graduates as in 2016).

In 2017 we invested in two new Apprentice 
Academies to train more people wanting 
careers as bus engineers. These academies 
will become centres of excellence, with 
opportunities for established engineers  
to improve skills through Continuous 
Professional Development training.  
We will build on this by helping design the 
new national Bus and Coach Apprenticeship.

Arriva UKEmployees at Arriva 
share their experiences

Sharon Keith
Regional Director
Arriva Rail North
‘ I joined Arriva eight years ago  
as Customer Service Director for 
the Tyne & Wear Metro contract. 
Moving into operations was an 
unusual step to take but Arriva 
really supported me. I was invited 
to take part in Arriva DRIVE  
(the directors’ development 
programme) to develop my  
skills further, which then led to  
me being promoted to Managing 
Director for that business. 

I’ve been in my current position 
for 18 months – a more demanding 
role across a much bigger sector 
and geographical footprint.  
I’m involved in the ADD Women’s 
Conference, which is about 
developing women in senior 
positions and mentoring people at 
all levels, from graduate to ‘Head 
of’ levels. I feel very fortunate in 
the number of opportunities I’ve 
been presented with.’

Ken Carlaw
Pension Consultant,  
Arriva Group
‘I had been Company Secretary  
at Arriva Group for about six 
years. My job was great but  
pretty demanding: my wife  
works full-time during school  
term time and I wasn’t at home 
much for her and our two young 
kids, but I didn’t want to leave 
Arriva fully.

As I was already a trustee on the 
Group pension schemes, it made 
sense for me to chair the Arriva 
Pension Schemes and consult on 
projects on a three-day week basis.

The pensions landscape is 
incredibly busy with plenty  
of professional and technical 
challenges to ensure I’m 
developing over the next few 
years. I’m 55 and conscious of 
health and looking after myself: 
part of achieving that is a work-
life balance for the family, which 
we now have.’ 

Vilma Douglas
HR Team Leader
Arriva London
‘I started with Arriva in 1996 as  
a receptionist but also offered to 
help the Engineering department 
with some of their payroll and 
personnel processes. Eventually  
I moved into that department and 
spent 18 years as the Engineering 
Personnel & Payroll Clerk. I’m now 
in HR as the HR Team Leader.

Arriva always encourages you  
to go for opportunities that  
arise – even if they’re not  
within your original skillset –  
and support your learning, 
especially as I constantly need  
to update policies and procedures 
in line with current legislation. 
Thankfully, I work with a very 
supportive team with varying 
levels of HR experience and we 
complement each other well.’

09

Our 2017 gender pay gap reportWe’re part of the communities we serve and welcome people 
from different backgrounds with diverse skills and talents. 
And we all have one thing in common: we aim to provide high 
quality, good value transport services and develop new ways  
to make journeys better.

Aysia Jelani
Business Development  
Director, Arriva UK Bus
‘My background is in 
communications but Arriva saw 
my potential and encouraged  
me to move into business 
development. Two years ago, 
I started a new role to grow  
an exciting new business area  
for Arriva UK Bus: Demand 
Responsive Transport (DRT).

I started with a blank canvas. 
I had to assess the market 
externally and our capabilities,  
pull together a product, form 
partnerships to bridge any  
gaps, then pilot the product.

I really welcomed the opportunity 
to be involved with other Arriva 
businesses across Europe also 
undertaking DRT.

I’ve been fully supported to 
develop the project in the way  
I see fit. DRT has grown and  
grown – Arriva is now investing  
in it even further and we’re going 
into other areas across the UK.’

Stephen Tivey
Train Conductor,  
Arriva Rail North
‘I helped set up the “Workers 
Together” group, a cross-business 
group that champions diversity  
and inclusion for LBGT+, HIV &  
AIDS awareness and gender 
equality for our region.
    
We engage with local communities 
and promote jobs in the rail 
industry with Arriva in a number  
of ways. For example, at Pride 
events across the north-west  
such as Manchester Mega Mela,  
on Facebook, and by working with 

HIV, Asian groups and charities.  
We even use the railway to get  
a message of support across by 
wrapping a train in a red ribbon  
to promote World AIDS Day.
    
The National Centre for Diversity 
has just awarded Arriva Rail North 
“UK Transportation Organisation  
of the Year 2018” – for the second 
year running!’

Lydia McGhee
Engineering Apprentice
Arriva Rail North
‘I’m 21 and started at Arriva three 
years ago as a Train Presentation 
Operative, cleaning and maintaining 
trains at night, having decided not 
to progress with A-levels. After 
a year, I applied for an engineering 
apprenticeship. I had no engineering 
background and had never even 
picked up a tool! I was given an 
amazing opportunity to work 
with engineers in the depot for  
a week to see if I’d enjoy the  
work and the environment.

I go to college once a week; the 
rest of the time, I’m working  
with qualified engineers here  
and learning on the job until  
I qualify in 2020. Arriva offers  
a supportive environment.  
People are willing to help  
and support you, whenever  
you need it.’
