Gender Pay Gap Data - August 2017      Male   Female        Number Mean Median Number Mean Median    Whole Organisation 305 £9.99 £15.98 470 £10.79 £12.34    Upper Quartile 66 £18.12 £19.36 125 £18.40 £19.36    Upper Middle Quartile 76 £10.08 £9.13 119 £9.97 £8.94    Lower Middle Quartile 77 £7.63 £7.53 117 £7.38 £7.64    Lower Quartile 86 £6.59 £7.05 109 £6.12 £7.05        Upper Quartile – is high because it is predominately made up of female Group Exercise Coaches.  Upper Middle Quartile and Lower Middle Quartile as expected because females predominately gravitate towards the part time roles e.g. reception, creche, café and leisure assistants.  Lower Quartile – This is made up of the Leisure Assistants, Lifeguards, Holiday Programme Assistants which are graded bottom of scale 1 or National Minimum Wage.  In summary as an organisation we are proud to report that there isn’t a huge discrepancy between male and female pay.
