The gender pay gap is the difference in earnings between men and women regardless of the roles they do.  Gender pay is different to equal pay, which looks at the actual pay differences between people carrying out the same or comparable work.  Baker Perkins is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to the principle of equal pay.  Baker Perkins’ gender pay gap reflects that the company has a higher proportion of men in senior roles in the business.  It also reflects national statistics, that women are generally under-represented in the engineering profession.  (In the UK, women engineering professionals made up only 8% of the occupation’s population in 2016).  Our gender pay bonus calculation result reflects that a high proportion of the bonuses received were to men receiving a small monetary award in regards to the suggestion scheme run by the company.
