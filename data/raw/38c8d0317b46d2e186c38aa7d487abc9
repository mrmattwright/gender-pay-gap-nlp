GENDER PAY GAP
REPORT 2017

Brakes UK is at an exciting time: this year we celebrate 60 years; we are now part of 
the Sysco family, the world’s largest foodservice company; and our colleagues are 
more engaged than ever. 

I am pleased to report that relative to the UK national average of 18%, our Gender 
Pay Gap is comparatively low at 1.75%. This is positive news for us, as it means that 
we have almost no difference in average or midpoint pay between men and women 
overall in our business. 

We have always said that the success of Brakes is down to its people. Our 7,000 colleagues have a unique 
spirit, doing everything possible as individuals and teams to help our tens of thousands of customers to 
thrive day in, day out. A business like ours offers a diverse range of job roles, the majority of which are in 
operations, and we provide one in five out of home meals to a customer base as varied as our workforce: from 
5* hotels, restaurants, schools, hospitals and care homes to local independent restaurants and take-aways, and 
everything in between.  

We have an ongoing commitment and focus to provide an open, diverse and respectful environment for all 
our colleagues, and our colleagues’ feedback on this through our annual engagement survey recognises our 
approach to Diversity & Inclusion as a particular strength, ahead of UK benchmarks. We have been working 
on our Diversity & Inclusion approach for some years now, starting with our company values, through our 
mandatory Respect At Work training for all managers, and creating equal opportunity for career development 
through our talent and development programmes. We will continue with our focus on equal treatment for all, 
and build on the good work already in place. 

This is the first time that we have reported on our Gender Pay Gap in line with the new UK legislation, and we 
will be doing so annually. We aim to offer a great working environment and opportunities for all who work at 
Brakes UK, helping us continue to build on the great business we have today.

OUR RESULTS  AS OF 5TH APRIL 2017
OUR GENDER PAY GAP STATISTICS
DIFFERENCE IN ‘MEAN’ PAY
1.75%UK 2017 18.4%

This means we paid our female 
colleagues 1.75% less than our male 
colleagues on average

DIFFERENCE IN ‘MEDIAN’ PAY

9.67%UK 2017 17.4%

The mid-point salary between the lowest 
and highest paid female colleagues was 
9.67% less than the mid-point salary for 
male colleagues

DIFFERENCE IN ‘MEAN’  
BONUSES PAID

15.82%N/A

This means we paid our female 
colleagues 15.82% less in bonuses than 
we paid our male colleagues on average

The ‘mean’ is the average . Add up all the values to find a total, 
then divide the total by the number of values. E.g. 6+3+9+2 = 
20. 20÷4 = 5.

BONUS PAYOUTS
Equal numbers of females and males had 
the opportunity to earn a bonus.

This includes the bonus paid when Brakes 
was bought by Sysco.

PAY QUARTILES
Pay quartiles are created by ranking all 
colleagues from highest to lowest paid 
and ensuring there is an equal number 
of colleagues in each quartile. So, if we 
had 400 colleagues, there would be 100 
in each pay quartile. We then look at the 
gender split for each of the four parts. 
Therefore, if we have 100 people in our 
highest pay bracket, 28 of them will be 
women. Our overall gender split is 76% 
male and 24% female. The UK average is 
52% male to 48% female.

DIFFERENCE IN ‘MEDIAN’  
BONUSES PAID

-16.21%N/A

The mid-point between the lowest and 
highest female colleague bonuses was 
16.21% higher than the mid-point bonus 
for male colleagues
The ‘median’ is the middle or mid-point value. Put all of the 
values into order. The median is the middle value. E.g. 2 3 4 5 6. 
The median value is 4.
