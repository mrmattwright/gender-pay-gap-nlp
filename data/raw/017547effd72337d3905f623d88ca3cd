Gender Pay Gap Report April 2017 

The Government published new regulations relating to equality in the workplace which came into 
force this year. These apply to all organisations, including schools, with over 250 employees on 
the 5 April 2017.  As a qualifying employer Caterham School is required to analyse and report on 
our gender pay gap which involves calculating average rate of pay across the whole school and 
the distribution of male and female staff into quartiles.

When taking the upper middle and upper quartiles together, 56% are females and overall 60% of our 
staff are female.  

At 12.4%, our mean gender pay gap is smaller than the indicative average for the UK generally in 
2017 which is 17.4% and smaller than the indicative average for education which is 15% (i).  

Our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue; our approach to pay is gender neutral by design and 
our analysis shows that our pay gap is driven by the structure of our workforce. 

•  We have a range of roles within our workface with a significantly higher proportion of women 

than men in our non-management posts. 

•  We have a higher number of men than women in professional and senior/middle management 

roles. 

Salaries are compared using hourly rates and to calculate this an employer establishes how many 
hours an individual works per week. Where contracts do not specify a number of hours per week, 
as is the case with academic staff, a reasonable estimate is used looking at the year as a whole and 
taking an average. As an independent day and boarding school we have used an estimated 40 
hours per week for our teaching staff who make up the largest group in our upper quartile. Other 

schools may use different estimates and it is important to know what that figure is if comparing 
averages between organisations.    
 
How Caterham is tackling its gender pay gap 
Our figure shows there is more work to be done and whilst we take care to ensure that we don’t 
have an equal pay issue through the use of salary scales for almost all staff, benchmarking salaries 
regularly and applying the annual percentage increase universally, we do need to take steps to 
reduce our pay gap. 

That means we are having a closer look at the structure of our workforce and in particular what 
we can do to encourage more women into senior roles.  

Note: 
Along with other employers of 250 staff or more, we would be required to report on our gender 
bonus gap had we paid bonus payments in April 2017.
