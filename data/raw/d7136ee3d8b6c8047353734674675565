We are deeply committed to working against any form of discrimination and remain especially committed to ensuring gender diversity in our management positions. To this end, we have set a number of management diversity objectives, and progress is reviewed once a year by our Executive Management and Board of Directors.  • By 2020, the percentage of women in senior management positions (members of the Management Board, General Managers and Vice Presidents) should be at least 40%. At the end of 2017, 39% of senior management were women, compared with 37% in 2016, 33% in 2015 and 34% in 2014.  • The gender composition of the Group’s leadership programmes should mirror the gender composition of employees in Vice President and Director positions. Since we started our leadership programmes in 2012, the gender split has on aggregate been close to 50/50. In 2017, women accounted for 64% of this management group, and made up 60% of the enrolment in our leadership programmes.  • By 2018, our objective is that at least 35% of Board members elected at the Annual General Meeting should be women. At the end of 2017, women made up 33% of our Board members (3 out of 9), compared with 30% in 2016 (3 out of 10). This means we are well above the average of 16% for Danish listed companies. The Board will continue to consider gender composition when appointing new members.  Find more information about PANDORA leadership programme here .
