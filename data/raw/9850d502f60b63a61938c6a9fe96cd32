The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference in average earnings between men and women. The gender pay gap differs from equal pay as it is concerned with the differences in the average pay regardless of role.  What is the mean?  The mean hourly rate is the average hourly wage across the entire organisation, so the mean gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between women’s mean hourly wage and men’s mean hourly wage.  What is the median?  The median hourly rate is calculated by ranking all employees from the highest paid to the lowest paid, and taking the hourly wage of the person in the middle; so the median gender pay gap is the difference between women’s median hourly wage (the middle paid woman) and men’s median hourly wage (the middle paid man).  Difference in hourly rate  •        Women’s hourly rate is 15.5% lower (mean) and 15.1% lower (median).  Proportion of women in each pay quartile  Pay quartiles are calculated by splitting all employees in an organisation into four even groups according to their level of pay. Looking at the proportion of women in each quartile gives an indication of women's representation at different levels of the organisation.  •        Top salary quartile has 91.4% men and 8.6% women  •        Upper middle salary quartile has 86.2% men and 13.8% women  •        Lower middle salary quartile has 83.3% men and 16.7% women  •        Lower salary quartile has 66.9% men and 33.1% women  Bonus Pay  •        Women’s bonus pay is 35.3% lower (mean) and 50.6% lower (median)  •        85% of men and 63.6% of women received bonus pay      ​   ​                   In order to guarantee the best service possible, we make use of cookies.
