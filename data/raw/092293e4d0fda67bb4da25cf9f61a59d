The gender pay gap gives a snapshot of the gender balance within an organisation. It measures the difference between the average earnings of all male and female employees, irrespective of their role or seniority.  The gender split in CQC is 69.1% female to 30.9% male and this is closely replicated across the quartile data. The data shows that there is no gender pay gap at CQC as staff are paid within salary bands and the mean and median hourly rate of pay are virtually the same across all quartiles.  No data is included in the CQC gender pay gap reporting for bonuses as the CQC does not pay performance related bonuses.          %      1. Mean gender pay gap - Ordinary pay    1.18      2.
