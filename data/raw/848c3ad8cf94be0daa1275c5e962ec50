Our Gender Pay Gap statistics show the difference between the average earnings of men and women within our organisation, expressed as a percentage. They differ from Equal Pay statistics, which typically take account of the remuneration provided to male and female employees doing the same job.  Our full 2017 report is available here and is also published on the government’s online reporting service .  If you have any questions about this report, please feel free to contact us .
