We firmly believe that the requirement for all businesses to publish their Gender Pay information will help industries of all shapes and sizes both identify and address the critical issue of gender balance.    The Gender Pay Gap is the difference in the average hourly pay between all women and all men in a workforce. This is different to ‘equal pay’, which is the difference in pay between women and men carrying out similar jobs or work of equal value. We proactively monitor equal pay as part of our annual pay and bonus process.  As with many organisations, Arcadis’ Gender Pay and bonus gaps come about due to a higher proportion of men occupying senior positions in the business. In 2017, the mean average hourly pay difference between men and women at Arcadis was 21.7%, while the median was 25.7%.  As a business, we are fully committed to tackling the gender imbalance across our workforce and to create a great workplace for women to excel.   How we are addressing the Gender Pay Gap  We want more females to join Arcadis. We want more females to remain in Arcadis. We want more females to progress in Arcadis.    Join Arcadis.

Helen McCarthy, People Director at Arcadis   “Promoting diversity in our industry is vital. Not only because it is the right thing to do but also because it brings better results for all. We are dealing with more diverse clients now, so we need to bring more diverse teams in to meet their needs.  “Key to all of this is getting a strong gender balance at each and every tier of our business.
