It was a new standard of yacht making. Today, our passion to exceed boundaries is as strong as ever before, brought to life by a team of over 2,000 highly skilled designers, engineers and master craftsmen. Bold new creations like the 155 Yacht keep us pushing our standards ever further, year upon year. Just as we have always done. Seek More         Craftsmanship         A hawk’s eye, expert hands and a devilish attention to detail. Passed from generation to generation, these are the most important skills required to make a Sunseeker. In an age of digital production and automated assembly, we stay committed to creating hand-built, hand-finished boats. Seek More      Lifestyle      Owning a Sunseeker yacht isn’t a statement. It’s something far more powerful. It is a hard won independence. The ability to see new horizons from a different perspective. Above all, a rare kind of liberty. A masterpiece of high performance design and engineering, a Sunseeker yacht takes you to truly special places with those who are truly special to you.     Yet, though a Sunseeker yacht is made with physical craft and materials, at its heart it is made with a true spirit of excellence. Only with this unique essence can we create yachts that deliver such an enduring possibility for escape. Seek More        Only with a unique vision, craft and confidence can such an exceptional yacht come into being. So it’s no surprise that a Sunseeker is conceived by the world’s finest maritime architects, engineers and designers – then hand built with painstaking attention to detail by craftspeople who embody generations of experience.
