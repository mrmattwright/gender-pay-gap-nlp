In 2017, it became a legal 
requirement for all UK companies with 
a workforce of more than 250 people 
to measure and publish their gender 
pay gap. 
The rationale behind this government 
initiative is to build greater awareness 
of gender imbalance within UK 
industry, and to encourage companies 
to consider ways of reducing disparity.
This is particularly relevant for the 
engineering and manufacturing 
sectors. 2017 surveys indicate only 
11% of the engineering workforce in 
the UK is female. Whilst this is a 
positive change from 9% in 2015, the 
UK still has the lowest percentage of 
female engineering professionals in 
Europe.
In 2017 50% of all GCSE physics 
students were girls, but that becomes 
only around 20% at A-Level** and this 
has not changed in 25 years. This 
shortage of female students translates 
through to higher education, where 
only 15.1% of engineering 
undergraduates in 2017 were women.  

WE WELCOME THE GENDER PAY INITIATIVE. WE ARE ACUTELY 
AWARE THAT INDUSTRIES SUCH AS ENGINEERING AND 
MANUFACTURING HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD SMALLER 
PROPORTIONS OF FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN SENIOR POSITIONS, 
WHICH INEVITABLY CREATES LARGER AVERAGE PAY GAPS.   

EQUAL PAY
When discussing this subject, it is 
first important to explain that the 
gender pay gap is the difference 
between the average (mean and 
median) earnings of men and 
women, expressed as a 
percentage of men’s earnings.
The gender pay gap is distinct from 
the legal requirement under the 
Equality Act to pay men and 
women equally for doing similar 
jobs.    
During 2016/2017 we worked 
with external advisors, Inglis Jones 
Kincaid Ltd, to fairly, objectively 
and systematically compare roles 
across the team. 
By the end of the project with 
Inglis Jones Kincaid Ltd, we were 
confident that there were no pay 
discrepancies. 

IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION, 

MERCEDES-AMG PETRONAS 
ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE 

BOTH POLICY AND PRACTICE OF 
EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, 

BASED ON THE DETAILED 

CONSIDERATION OF EACH ROLE 

WITHIN THE TEAM.

PAY GAP
Based on a snapshot of data from 
April 2017, we are required to 
publish gender pay gap figures as 
follows: 

35%

LOWER (MEAN)

17%

LOWER (MEDIAN)

On average, women working in 
this team earn 35% less per hour 
than men. The median figure is 
17% less per hour. 

This figure difference is driven by 
the fact that there are more men in 
senior, higher-paid roles within the 
team, which is a consequence of 
the fact that women make up only 
9% of our total workforce.  
This is not uncommon in the 
engineering profession as a whole, 
where women make up only 11% of 
employees.

for our gender pay gap.

BONUS GAP

Our bonus pay gap (59% mean, 0% median) is driven by the variety of bonus 
structures being employed in the business and the number of men in senior 
roles. 

94% OF MEN

BONUSES

86% OF WOMEN

All male and female employees who were employed on the bonus payment 
date in January, and not serving notice to leave, received a bonus for the 
2016 Formula One Constructors’ Championship win.  

WHAT WE ARE DOING 
TO CLOSE THE GAP

Together with the rest of the 
engineering industry, we recognise 
that we have a shortage of women 
in senior roles. This is not where we 
want to be and we would like to 
improve our position.
We are committed to ensuring that 
no employee receives less 
favourable treatment than another 
because of their age, gender, 
disability and other protected 
characteristics. 
We will also continue to actively 
support and develop our talented 
employees, as well as trying to 
increase the proportion of women 
working in our team, because we 
believe this will create a stronger 
and more capable organisation for 
the future.

Our talent management committee 
is tasked with exploring 
opportunities to promote gender 
diversity.  
We are proud to support ‘Dare 2 be 
Different’ - an initiative launched to 
help inspire, connect and develop 
women who work in or would like to 
work in motorsport.
We are pleased to be sponsoring 
International Women in Engineering 
Day which is held on 23rd June each 
year. Through this, we will join the 
campaign to attract more female 
talent into engineering based roles. 

OUR COMMITMENT

We are actively committed to supporting 
initiatives that drive female talent by 
inspiring girls and young women to seek 
careers in engineering.
We share the same mission within our 
Formula One team, whether we are male 
or female, which is to build a legacy of 
championship-winning Silver Arrows race 
cars. In the same way, we strive to create 
a culture where our female colleagues 
can thrive and succeed. 
I’m pleased to see a growing number of 
women in engineering roles across all the 
technical functions of our team but there 
is still more to do if we are to also 
encourage the next generation.
I confirm that the data reported is 
accurate.
