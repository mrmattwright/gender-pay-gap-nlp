The Trust’s gender pay gap in both Mean (Average) and Median Hourly Rates and the Mean (Average) and Median Bonus Pay is largely driven by the high proportion of male medical staff.  These staff are generally high earners and in addition, are the staff who earn bonuses through National and Clinical Excellence Awards.            The national medical workforce (orthopaedics) has a strong male bias and as a specialist orthopaedic hospital, Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is the same. We will work with the National Orthopaedic Alliance and the British Orthopaedic Association to seek to encourage ways in which we can achieve a more diverse orthopaedic consultant workforce.  In addition, as a Trust we will review our recruitment practices including work experience and career promotion platforms to understand ways in which we might encourage and influence the different career choices of women and men.  This would involve working with medical and clinical students particularly but also, support service staff in traditionally male dominated areas such as estates & facilities and portering and female dominated roles within the Trust such as nursing.  In the short term however, this is unlikely to change.  The Trust has recalculated the gender pay gap for staff working at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, excluding medical staff.  The revised data in the table below shows a significant reduction in the gender pay gaps that is below the national mean of 18%.  Whilst the mean pay gap is still 7.80%, this is largely due to the bias in our nursing and Health Care Assistant roles which are predominantly female.  These pay rates are governed by the National Pay framework.
