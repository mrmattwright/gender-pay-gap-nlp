GENDER PAY GAP REPORT 2017

PAY GAP

BONUS GAP

The below shows the Lyreco UK Gender Pay Gap as a mean and Median Average as an 

hourly rate. This was captured on the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.

The bonus pay is worked out with stats from the 12 months preceding and ending on 

the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.

Mean
3.3%

Median
8.9%

Mean
23%

Median
537.7%

This shows on both occasions females are paid more on average.

This shows females are paid on average 23% more than males as a mean average and 

537.7% as a median average. We have a large proportion of male colleagues 
in our Logistics Department, where the bonus structure is different to the Sales
 element of the business. So while a relatively even amount of males and females 

receive a bonus, (as shown in the next section) the amount of males earning a smaller 

figure is a lot higher.

The above charts show the gender distribution across four equally sized pay quartiles.

This show the percentage of colleagues who received a bonus in the year up to and 

including the snapshot date of 5th April 2017.

This shows that Lyreco has a much higher percentage of male colleagues across all pay 
quartiles. However, in the upper quartiles there are more females than the lower quartiles.
