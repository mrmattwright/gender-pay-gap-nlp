Gender Pay Gap Report - February 2018  We are committed to making Welsh Water an inclusive place to work for everyone – and are working to ensure women have every opportunity to thrive in their careers with us. The Gender Pay Gap report shows the overall median and mean gender pay and bonus gap regardless of role or seniority.  It is important to note that this is different to the principle of equal pay - where all men and women at Welsh Water receive equal pay for performing equal work. For more information, you can see the data on the UK Government website here and you can read our gender pay reports on this page.
