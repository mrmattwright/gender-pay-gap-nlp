2017 Gender Pay Gap Report

Introduction

Results

To highlight the importance of equality, the UK government 
has introduced legislation that focuses on the mandatory 
reporting on Gender Pay.

Taking into account the mix of males and females at 
various levels throughout our workforce, Tenneco Walker 
(UK) Ltd have reported a negative median gender pay gap 
of 2.3%*.

Therefore, for the first time this year all large UK companies 
employing more than 250 employees are required to 
publish a report on their gender pay gap.

The results we publish for Tenneco Walker (UK) Limited 
are based on a gender pay snapshot date as at 5th April 
2017 with bonus data published for the 12 months to 5th
April 2017.

Our workforce

At Tenneco Walker (UK) Limited we are focused on 
manufacturing and as such the majority of our workforce 
are factory based where the roles are predominantly 
occupied by males at a ratio of 53.3:1.

Our office environment is weighed more evenly between 
males and females with a M:F ratio of 3.1:1 where two of 
the board positions are held by females.

Women hold a greater proportion of roles in the upper 
quartile than any other. As such, 12.2% of females were 
eligible for and received a bonus payment compared to 
5.6% of males.

The result of the report is that Tenneco Walker is one of the 
few organisations in the UK who does not need to address 
a gender pay imbalance and can confirm that equality in 
pay is at the forefront of the organisations best practice.
