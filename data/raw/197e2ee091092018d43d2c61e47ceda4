Our commitment

At Eversheds Sutherland we are committed to creating a 
workplace which reflects the world around us and where everyone 
has equal opportunities for development and progression. Our 
latest internal survey shows that 93% of our female employees 
believe that Eversheds Sutherland supports diversity in the 
workplace, and 82% believe we are an employer of choice for 
women in the legal sector. Eversheds Sutherland has featured in 
the Sunday Times Top 50 Employers for Women list for the past 
seven years. 

We are committed to pay equity at Eversheds Sutherland and we 
welcome the new gender reporting regulations and the 
transparency they bring to this critical issue. Keeping gender and 
other diversity issues as a central part of our agenda is crucial to 
enable our business to succeed in the future.

We are proud of the progress that we have made in terms of 
gender equality. Increasing female representation at partner level 
has been a key objective for us for a number of years, and we 
have already exceeded our initial female partner target of 25%.
We recently announced our new target, that women represent 
30% of the partnership by 2021. Likewise, we have met our initial 
target that 30% of our Partnership Council (our board) members 
are women and, as of 1 May 2018, the gender split will be 50:50. 

However our statistical analysis to produce our gender pay report 
has identified that there are female representation imbalances in 
parts of the wider firm which present us with further opportunities 
to develop a more consistent gender balance.

To support this we will:

 Continue monitoring our pay difference throughout our pay, 

bonus and promotion cycles

Eversheds Sutherland | 27 March 2018 |

 Work with our newly-appointed Gender Champion, Partner 

Diane Gilhooley, and use our newly launched Gender Network 
as a think-tank to inform our approach to gender diversity 

 Refresh our flagship global female development programme, 

Development Plus, which supports the development and 
retention of our senior lawyers and business services 
professionals. The programme will be open to all women at 
this level for the first time in 2018 

 Appoint at least one partner in each office to act as the local 

gender sponsor to help drive activity to support both the 
gender network and the Development Plus programme.

The information below shows our overall mean and median 
gender pay difference based on hourly rates of pay, and our 
mean and median bonus difference based on bonuses paid in the 
year to 5 April 2017, as well as the proportions of males and 
females receiving a bonus and our pay distribution quartiles in 
accordance with the requirements of the regulations.

Whilst the regulations require us only to report on employees, 
we have also reported the gender pay difference among our 
Equity and Fixed Share Partner groups.

We confirm that the information is accurate and has been 
calculated in line with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information Regulations 2017).

Common across many law firms is the number of female employees in secretarial and administrative positions. The below 
quartiles demonstrate that we have nearly twice as many females in lower base pay roles.  This representation influences our

Our gender pay position

The mean is the average.  We reach a mean percentage 
by adding all our figures together and dividing them by 
the total number of employees.  We reach our median
percentage by listing our employees pay from smallest to 
largest with the middle pay being the median.

As at 5 April 2017, our gender pay difference across 
the firm for all employees was:

Mean

23.22%

Median
25.41% 

The mean pay difference between our male and female 
employees for this reporting period was 23.22%.  Our 
median pay difference between our male and female

As a law firm we believe it is important to also consider 
our lawyer gender pay difference.

important to do so.

Our bonus pay position

Bonus pay is inclusive of chargeable hours, discretionary bonuses as well as recognition awards.  We operate different bonus 
schemes for fee earners and non fee-earners which apply equally to men and women in those categories.  Both of these 
schemes reward performance by recognising achievement of specified objectives. 

Our analysis suggests that higher representation of females in the non fee-earner category reflects the higher bonus 
differences for the overall firm because more females received bonuses at the lower end of the value range (i.e. £0-£500) 
because of their roles.
