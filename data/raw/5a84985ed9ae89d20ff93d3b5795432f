Careers  What we offer  Our vacancies  Graduate programme                    Pioneering vacant space scheme to cut NHS estate costs  We have launched a new scheme to help commissioners cut the cost of empty space in their buildings, leaving them more to spend on frontline care.  NHS Property Services’ new Vacant Space Handback Scheme comes in response to feedback from commissioners who want to reduce the cost of maintaining space that they decide is no longer needed for clinical services.  Although the costs of vacant space in the NHS are kept as low as possible, some costs are unavoidable because rent, business rates and some service charges remain payable. The total amount and cost of vacant space in the NHS is hard to calculate, but costs are estimated to be in excess of £10million a year on the NHS Property Services estate alone.  The vacant space handback scheme is an innovative arrangement which allows commissioners to pass the liability for eligible vacant space back to NHS Property Services (NHSPS).
