FSIS also develop UV inkjet inks for industrial and wide format OEMs directly.                              R & D      Manufacturing      Products      Careers      UK Modern Slavery Act           FUJIFILM Speciality Ink Systems ' core skill is ink design, with an unmatched understanding of ink chemistry, print applications, media, printheads and UV curing. Fujifilm’s design capability encompasses R&D resources, a legacy of ink formulation and vast manufacturing experience.  Continual investment in research and development enables Fujifilm to keep up with the rapid advances in inkjet printing technology and deliver ink systems that fuel some of the world's most powerful wide format printers.  A high speed digital printer may have to place billions of droplets of ink accurately, every second in order to form a high resolution image at production speed. The demands on printheads and ink performance are very high and so formulations must meet precise performance specifications.  When designing an ink, our chemists consider properties like printed finish, adhesion to the printed material, flexibility and finishing, while controlling particle size, viscosity and surface tension to produce inks that jet reliably.  Inks are rigorously tested in the laboratory and in production environments where prints are tested for jetting reliability, print quality, production performance and weathering to ensure they meet Fujifilm’s stringent performance and quality assurance standards.  A central research and development team is situated alongside the manufacturing facilities in Broadstairs, UK, supported by two facilities:  The FUJIFILM Cambridge Engineering Facility in Cambridge, UK, is a wholly owned division of FSIS set up in 2011 as a centre of excellence to provide innovative printing solutions to the digital graphics industry. The Advanced Marking Research Centre in Tokyo, Japan supports FSIS with the development of fundamental technologies and materials.           The manufacturing facility at FUJIFILM Speciality Ink Systems ’ Broadstairs site occupies 8000m 2 , with an additional 4000m 2 of finished product warehousing space.  Fujifilm uses a sophisticated manufacturing process where the need for consistent high quality permeates the entire production process.   Inkjet ink production is carried out in a process controlled, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. This recognises the equal importance of both the ink formulation and the production process, and provides controls over every aspect of manufacture to ensure consistency.   Raw materials Fujifilm works in partnership with its raw material suppliers ensuring that these materials meet an agreed specification.  Micro-V dispersion Colour pigments are dispersed to reduce the size of particles down to less than 200nm – far smaller than a human cell.  Fujifilm’s proprietary Micro-V dispersion process takes over 30 hours.  Mixing The pigment dispersion is blended with the other components in the formulation in mixing vessels capable of producing 4 tonne batches.  Post processing Post processing is the final part of the Micro-V dispersion process and is designed to equalise pigment particle distribution within the finished ink.  Automated filling and packing To deal with high production volumes the filling and packing process is semi-automatic.  Inks are packaged in a variety of containers, pouches and cartridges.  FSIS has invested significantly in alternative methods of reducing its environmental footprint at its manufacturing site.  Reducing energy use ‘Waste’ energy in the form of heat from production processes and compressed air generation via a bespoke new heat exchange system is used to provide 70% of the heating required for the factory.  Reusing waste 100% of the manufacturing packaging and production waste is recycled.  This work has played its part in FSIS being accredited to the Environmental standard ISO 14001, in addition to the Quality standard ISO 9001 and twice being awarded the Best Process Plant ‘Best Factory Award’.
