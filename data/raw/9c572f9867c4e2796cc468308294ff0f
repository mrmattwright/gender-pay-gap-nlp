Gender Pay Gap Report 2017

Under new laws, Colas Limited as an employer with 250 or more employees, is required 
to  publish  an  annual  gender  pay  gap  report  showing  any  differences  in  pay  between 
male  and  female  employees.  The  report  is  based  on  pay  data  as  at  5th April  2017.

The Colas gender pay gap is significantly lower than the 
national average. 

The mean gender bonus gap and the median gender bonus 
gap for Colas reflect the higher proportion of male employees 
in senior management positions that attract higher bonus 
payments, in addition to incentive/bonus payments received 
by our predominantly male operative workforce.

Pay Quartiles 
The proportion of males and females in each quartile pay band is as follows:

There is a relatively 
consistent split of males 
and females within each 
of the quartiles reflective 
of the predominantly 
male dominated sector 
in which we work. The 
percentage of females in 
the upper quartile is slightly 
lower reflecting the fewer 
number of women in senior 
management positions.

Summary
Colas Limited, like many other organisations within the construction sector, has a high proportion of males 
employed. We are therefore pleased that our gender pay gap compares favourably with that of other 
organisations.

Colas recognises the need to build more female capability at all levels, and in particular at senior level. We 
are currently taking action to attract more women into the organisation through our recruitment practices, 
inspiring more females to work in the sector through our engagement with local schools and colleges and 
promoting a diverse and inclusive culture.
