Nottingham City Transport is committed to diversity. We are a strong supporter of pay gap reporting and believe it is a significant step towards creating gender pay equality.  We have appropriate policies and processes in place to ensure that men and women are paid equally for any equivalent jobs across our business. We also recognise, as a public transport business, that our challenge is to increase the gender balance in the Organisation. This, in turn, will positively impact on our gender pay gap.  I can confirm that the figures have been verified and checked to ensure their accuracy.  M J Fowles  Managing Director   The above shows Nottingham City Transport’s mean and median gender pay gap based on hourly rates of pay at the snapshot date of the 5th April 2017. It also captures the mean and median differences between bonuses paid to men and women at Nottingham City Transport in the year up to the 5th April 2017. Our mean bonus pay is higher for females.   The above shows a 1.53% difference between the number of men and women being paid a bonus in the 2016 – 2017 financial year at Nottingham City Transport. The above information is based on their being 1064 relevant Nottingham City Transport employee’s included within the calculation.  The above image illustrates the gender distribution at Nottingham City Transport across four equally sized pay quartiles, each containing 242 Nottingham City Transport employees.
