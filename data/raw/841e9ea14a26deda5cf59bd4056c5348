Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council

 

Annual Pay Policy Statement 2018/19

1.

Introduction 

1.1 This Pay Policy Statement (the ‘statement’) sets out the Council’s 

approach to pay policy in accordance with the requirements of Section 
38 of the Localism Act 2011.  The statement also has due regard for the 
associated statutory guidance including supplementary guidance issued 
in February 2013 and the Local Government Transparency code 2014. 
For the first time the statement also incorporates the Councils Gender 
Pay Gap information as the Council is now required to publish this on an 
annual basis under the GPG reporting requirements. 

1.2 The purpose of the statement is to provide transparency with regard to 

the Council’s approach to setting the pay of its employees (excluding 
teaching staff working in local authority schools) by confirming the 
methods by which salaries of all employees are determined; the detail 
and level of remuneration of its most senior staff i.e. ‘chief officers’, as 
defined by the relevant legislation; the responsibility of the Appointments 
Committee to ensure the provisions set out in this statement relating to 
the Chief Executive, Deputy Chief Executive, Corporate Directors and 
Service Directors are applied consistently throughout the Council and 
recommend any amendments to the Council.

1.3 Once approved by the full Council, this policy statement will come into 

effect from the following April and will be subject to review on a minimum 
of an annual basis, the policy for the next financial year being approved 
by 31 March each year. 

2.  Other legislation relevant to pay and remuneration

2.1 In determining the pay and remuneration of all of its employees, the 

Council will comply with all relevant employment legislation.  This 
includes legislation such as the Equality Act 2010, Part Time 
Employment (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 
2000 and where relevant, the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of 
Earnings) Regulations [TUPE].  

3.  Background 

3.1 Stockport Council’s single cohesive programme for public reform and 
growth is the positive and proactive approach to meeting the financial 
challenges faced by the Council. It focuses on making the best use of 

the resources and has seen the Council and its partners invest 
significantly in the growth of the Town Centre and the Borough and 
taking more of a lead role in developing an economically active town. 
This is alongside refining the way the Council delivers services, working 
with partners across all public services to make the changes needed to 
ensure that; 

 Our neighborhoods are successful and sustainable
 Our communities are resilient and empowered
 Our people are independent

3.2 The principle is one of ‘invest to save’ – helping people to be more 
independent so that there is less demand for services in the future. 

3.3 The Council focus is to consider where it can best invest and spend the 

money it has now and in future years and align this with others to 
achieve shared outcomes and effectively ensure growth of the Borough. 
The Council will have less money overall, but will use it in a more 
focused way to deliver the agreed outcomes for the Borough.

3.4 The Council has already delivered over £100 million savings since 

2011/12. It is forecast there will be a requirement to save a further £60 
million by 2023.

3.5 Stockport Council clearly recognises the complex, challenging and 

competing drivers underpinning public sector remuneration, especially at 
a senior level,  including:

 The financial constraints of the public purse and imperative to 

demonstrate value for money at all times

 The organisation’s obligations under equal pay legislation
 The importance of attractive terms and conditions to enable the 

Council to recruit and retain quality staff

3.6 The Council has reviewed elements of its pay and grading arrangements 

which relate to terms and conditions of employment in order to ensure 
these are fit for purpose and meet the current needs of the Council. This 
has resulted in the following changes:

 Removal of the car leasing scheme by 30 September 2014
 Increase in employee car parking charges which was linked to 

the introduction of a salary sacrifice arrangement to help 
minimise the impact on employees (although salary sacrifice can 
no longer be used for this purpose from April 2018)

 As a result of a Council wide review of additional allowances 

such as home working, broadband and fuel, these allowances 
have been removed

 Introduction of control procedures, through the workforce 

deployment panel, in order to scrutinise and monitor recruitment 
and other employee related expenditure across the Council 
 A review of employee car allowances and car parking was 

completed in 2015/16. This ensures car allowances are only 
paid where this is appropriate to the current job role and that car 
park passes are allocated on the basis of usage in current job 
role. Robust criteria on qualification for both are now in place 
and this has been kept under review

 A proposal is currently being consulted upon to undertake a 
further review, in consultation with unions, of the Staff Travel 
Policy 

4.

Pay Structure

4.1 Under section 112 of the Local Government Act 1972, the Council has 
the “power to appoint officers on such reasonable terms and conditions 
as the authority thinks fit”. The Council’s pay and grading structures 
were determined following a comprehensive pay and grading review. 
The Council uses the Greater London Provincial Council job evaluation 
scheme for job roles up to senior officer level and the HAY job evaluation 
scheme for management roles. This ensures that there is no pay 
discrimination within its pay structures and that all pay differentials can 
be objectively justified through the use of job evaluation mechanisms, 
which directly establish the relative levels of the grades of posts 
according to the requirements, demands and responsibilities of the job 
role. The Council’s pay and grading structures are subject to ongoing 
review; as a result this has brought about the implementation of the 
Living Wage Foundation rate for low paid employees. Further detail can 
be found in section 9 of this statement.

4.2 The Council uses the nationally negotiated pay spine(s) (i.e. a defined 

list of salary points) as the basis for its local pay structure, which 
determines the salaries of the large majority of its (non-teaching) 
workforce together with the use of locally determined rates where these 
do not apply. To view the Council’s current NJC pay structure follow this 
link.

0Expenses,%20Benefits%20and%20Pensions/Pay/Pay%20Scales%202
017-18.pdf

4.3 The Council adopts the national pay bargaining arrangements in respect 
of the establishment and revision of the national pay spine, for example 
through any agreed annual pay increases negotiated with joint trade 
unions. The current national pay deal runs until 31 March 2018. Rates of 
pay beyond this date have not yet been agreed. However it is clear 
further changes will be required to the lower end of the national pay 
spine in order to effectively accommodate the National Living Wage and 

a review of the national pay spine is now underway. Further details are 
outlined in section 9 of this statement. 

4.4 All other pay related allowances are the subject of either nationally or 
locally negotiated rates, having been determined from time to time in 
accordance with the collective bargaining machinery.  

4.5 In determining its grading structure and setting remuneration levels for 
any posts which fall outside its scope, the Council takes account of the 
need to ensure value for money in respect of the use of public 
expenditure, balanced against the need to recruit and retain employees 
who are able to meet the requirements of providing high quality services 
to the community, delivered effectively and efficiently and at times at 
which those services are required.  

4.6 New appointments will normally be made at the minimum of the relevant 
pay scale for the grade, although this can be varied where necessary to 
secure the best candidate. For posts at Chief Executive, Deputy Chief 
Executive, Corporate Director and Service Director level, the 
Appointments Committee must approve commencing salaries above the 
minimum of the pay scale. 

4.7 From time to time it may be necessary to take account of the external 
pay levels in the labour market in order to attract and retain employees 
with particular experience, skills and capacity.  Where necessary, the 
Council will ensure the requirement for such is objectively justified by 
reference to clear and transparent evidence of relevant market 
comparators, using data sources available from within the local 
government sector and outside, as appropriate. 

4.8 Any supplement to the salary scale for the grade must have appropriate 

senior management approval, in line with Council policy. 

5.

Senior Management Remuneration

5.1 Employment arrangements for chief officers are linked to the relevant 

national agreements including the National Joint Council for Chief 
Executives and National Joint Council for Chief Officers. It should be 
noted that pay awards are determined through these national negotiating 
arrangement and there were no pay increases awarded nationally to 
these groups from 1 April 2008 to 31 December 2014. From 1 January 
2015 a 2% pay award was agreed, for these groups, although this only 
applied to salaries of £99,999 or less. Salaries above this amount were 
therefore unchanged. From 1 April 2016 a 1% pay award was agreed for 
these groups and a 1% increase was also agreed from 1 April 2017. The 
pay award from 1 April 2018 has not yet been agreed. 

5.2 In accordance with the Constitution of the Council, the Appointments 

Committee is responsible for decision making in relation to the recruitment, pay, 

terms and conditions  and severance arrangements in relation to the Chief 
Executive, Deputy Chief Executive, Corporate and Service Directors of the 
Council.

5.3 For the purposes of this statement, senior management means ‘chief 

officers’ as defined within the Localism Act. The posts falling within the 
statutory definition are set out below, with details of their current basic 
salary;

5.3.1 Chief Executive   

The salary falls within a range of 10 incremental points between 
£144,007.52 rising to a maximum of £173,469.03. The salary is inclusive 
of responsibility as Returning Officer for local elections and Electoral 
Registration Officer. Additional fees, determined by the Electoral 
Commission, are payable in the event of Parliamentary or European 
elections.

5.3.2 Corporate Directors and Deputy Chief Executive  

The salary of posts designated as Corporate Director and Deputy Chief 
Executive falls within a range of 10 incremental points between 
£102,980.12 rising to a maximum of £121,994.78.

5.3.3 Service Directors 

The salary of the post designated as Service Director falls within a range 
of 10 incremental points between £78,331.44 rising to a maximum of 
£98,212.17. 

5.4 The arrangements and factors considered in determining an individual’s 

progression through the relevant pay scale are set out in the 
Performance Development Review policy document for senior officers. 

5.5 Where the Council is unable to recruit chief officers, or there is a need 
for interim support to provide cover for a substantive chief officer post, 
the Council may, where necessary, consider engaging individuals under 
a ‘contract for service’.  These will be sourced through a relevant 
procurement process ensuring the Council is able to demonstrate the 
maximum value for money benefits from competition in securing the 
relevant service.  The Council does not currently have any chief officers 
engaged under these arrangements. 

5.6 The Council will take care when engaging people essentially to perform 
the role of an employee to avoid, contractual arrangements which could 
be perceived as being primarily designed to reduce significantly the rate 
of tax paid by the person. The Council does not have any such 
arrangements nor will it enter in to any such arrangements.

5.7 Details of senior pay can be found on the Council Transparency pages

6.

Recruitment and Remuneration of Chief Officers

6.1 The Council’s policy and procedures with regard to recruitment of chief 
officers are in accordance with the corporate Recruitment and Selection 
policy and as set out in Parts 3 and 4 of the Constitution.  

6.2 When recruiting to all posts the Council will take full and proper account 
of all provisions of relevant employment law and its own equality and HR 
Policies as approved by Council.  

6.3 The determination of the remuneration to be offered to any newly 
appointed Chief Executive, Deputy Chief Executive, Corporate or 
Service Director will be in accordance with the pay structure and relevant 
policies in place at the time of recruitment. In accordance with the 
Localism Act, where the proposed annual salary package is £100,000 or 
more the Council offers the decision to a meeting of the full Council, 
before the appointment is confirmed. Currently this only applies to the 
posts of Chief Executive, Deputy Chief Executive and Corporate 
Directors. The requirement to approve salary packages above £100,000 
only applies to new appointments and does not apply to existing senior 
managers.

6.4 The Council continues to review annually the delegation of Appointment 

Committee to act as the responsible group of elected members to fulfil 
the responsibility for the application of the pay policy for senior 
managers.  Any changes in policy developed by the Appointments 
Committee must be agreed by full Council, in accordance with the 
legislation. 

7.

Additions to Salary of Chief Officers

7.1 With the exception of progression through the incremental scale of the 

relevant grade being subject to satisfactory performance, which is 
assessed on an annual basis, the level of remuneration is not variable 
dependent upon the achievement of defined targets except that 
progression to the upper range is subject to exceptional performance. 
The Council does not operate a bonus related pay scheme.

7.2 To meet specific operational requirements it may be necessary for an 

individual to temporarily take on additional duties to their identified role. 
Any additional remuneration will be in accordance with Council’s HR 
policies.

7.3 In addition to basic salary Chief Officers are entitled to receive certain 

allowances in accordance with their terms and conditions of service and 
the relevant Council policies where appropriate. No allowances are 
currently paid by the Council in relation to additional leadership roles. 

8.

Payments on Termination

8.1 The Council’s approach to statutory and discretionary payments on 

termination of employment of the Chief Executive, Deputy Chief 
Executive, Corporate and Service Directors, prior to reaching normal 
retirement age, is in accordance with Regulations 5 and 6 of the Local 
Government (Early Termination of Employment) (Discretionary 
Compensation) Regulations 2006 [and if adopted] Regulation 12 of the 
Local Government Pension Scheme (Benefits, Membership and 
Contribution) Regulations 2007. 

8.2 Any payments falling outside these provisions or the relevant periods of 

notice within the contract of employment shall be subject to a formal 
decision made by the Appointments Committee and placed before full 
Council as appropriate. 

8.3 

In accordance with corporate policy the Council will not re-employ or re-
engage on a contract for service chief officers that have taken an 
enhanced severance package for a period of three years from their date 
of termination.

8.4 The Council will also have regard to the Local Government Modification 
Order where a severance payment has been made and the individual is 
re-employed.

9.

Lowest Paid Employees – Living Wage

9.1 At the Council Meeting on 25 April 2013 a decision was supported by all 
members of political parties to support the implementation of the Living 
Wage. The Living Wage is distinct from the National Minimum Wage, the 
government minimum for under 25’s currently £7.05 per hour. It is also 
distinct from the government’s National Living Wage (NLW) of £7.50 per 
hour. 

9.2 The Living Wage was created to set the minimum pay rate believed to 

be required for a worker to provide their family with the essentials of life, 
and is reliant upon the voluntary commitment of individual employers. 
The current Living Wage level set nationally in November each year is 
£8.75 per hour. This rate is set by the Centre for Research in Social 
Policy at Loughborough University and the research is funded by the 
Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Living Wage Foundation campaigns 
and promotes the implementation of the Living Wage by employers. 

9.3 The Government introduced the NLW for employees aged 25 and above 
on 1 April 2016 with the aim of reaching 60% of median UK earnings by 
2020. This rate is currently £7.50 per hour and is projected to rise to at 
least £9 per hour by 2020. It should be noted, the Government have 
announced the NLW rate will rise to £7.83 per hour from 1 April 2018. 

9.4 The lowest paid persons employed under a contract of employment with 

the Council are employed on full time [37 hours] equivalent salaries in 
accordance with the minimum spinal column point currently in use within 
the Council’s grading structure.  As at 1 April 2018, this will be £15,014 
per annum, £7.78 per hour. However those employees paid below the 
Living Wage rate (at that time) receive a supplement, from the Council, 
to bring their pay up to this level. This supplement would therefore mean 
the lowest paid full time salary in the Council would receive £16,835 
gross per annum, if the proposal in 9.5 below is adopted from 1 April 
2018. 

9.5 The Council has committed to review its approach to application of the 
Living Wage by the 1st of April on an annual basis. It is proposed, in line 
with current policy, the Council increases its living wage supplement to 
align with the current living wage rate of £8.75 per hour with effect from 1 
April 2018. 

9.6 It should be noted that the Council employs Apprentices [or other such 

categories of workers] who are not considered within the definition of 
‘lowest paid employees’ as they are employed under a training contract. 
However apprentices employed by the Council are paid at the national 
minimum rate for age which is higher than the national rate for 
apprentices. 

9.7 The table below shows the lower end of the national pay spine and the 
points at which the National Living Wage (NLW) Effective from 1 April 
2017 and the Living Wage (LW) impact on specific points in the pay 
spine.

9.8 It is recognised at national level that the current national pay spine has lost its 
relevance to modern working arrangements and is unable to absorb the new 
NLW along with the planned increases. It is also clear that a number of 
Councils have already taken the decision to pay the Living Wage (or their own 
version of this) and therefore a restructure of the national pay spine is required. 

9.9 A two-year pay agreement was reached from 2016 to 2018, with a headline of 

one per cent increase in each of 2016 and 2017 in addition to increasing the 
bottom pay points to take account of the new NLW. While the 2016-18 pay deal 
made considerable progress in meeting that challenge, there will still be a need 
to increase the bottom pay point by a further 16% to achieve the Government’s 
target of 60% of median earnings in 2020.

9.10 The National Employers are now progressing the longer-term review of the pay 

spine with Trade Unions which it is recognised is necessary to meet the 
challenge set by the NLW. Formal negotiations have not yet started however 
technical work is underway and a set of principle for the review have been 
established.  

9.11 The relationship between the rate of pay for the lowest paid and chief officers is 

determined by the processes used for determining pay and grading structures 
as set out in section 4.1 of this policy statement.

10. Pay Multiples  

10.1 At 23 November 2017 the median full time equivalent salary within the Council 
is £24,964. The pay multiples for the current policy are set out below, as at 23 
November 2017. Two calculations are provided:

 the ratio between the highest paid salary (£144,007.52) and the median 

salary of the whole of the workforce (£24,964). This multiple is 1:5.76, 
which is lower than last year’s figure of 1:6.09 primarily due to the 
reduction in the highest paid salary figure.

 the ratio between the highest paid salary (£144,007.52) and the current 

lowest salary (£16257.80). This multiple for 2017/18 is 1:8.8. This 
multiple is an improvement on the 16/17 figure of 1:10.8 primarily 
because of the reduction in the highest paid salary figure.

10.2 As part of its overall and ongoing monitoring of alignment with external pay 

markets, both within and outside the sector, the council will use available 
benchmark information as appropriate. 

11. Gender Pay Gap reporting

11.1 From 2017 public sector organisations including government 

departments, the armed forces, local authorities and NHS bodies and 
most schools with 250 employees or more must publish and report 
specific figures about their gender pay gap. The GPG is the difference 
between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to 
the men’s earnings e.g. women earn 15% less than men per hour. The 
figures are calculated using a specific reference date or “snapshot date.” 
This date is the 31 March each year and organisations must publish this 
information on their public facing web site within 12 months. 

11.2 Schools with 250 or more employees must report and publish their own 

information and will not be included in the local education authority’s 
GPG reporting. In Stockport there are currently no schools with 250 or 
more employees and are not therefore required to report on their GPG.

11.3 The information which must be published is: mean gender pay gap in 
hourly pay: median gender pay gap in hourly pay: mean bonus gender 
pay gap: median bonus gender pay gap: promotion of males and 
females receiving a bonus payment: promotion of males and females in 
each pay quartile. A point to note is that Stockport Council does not have 
any pay bonus schemes.

11.4 In anticipation of the GPG reporting requirement, last year the Council 

agreed to include the GPG information in the Annual Pay Policy 
Statement. In order to ensure compliance with the requirements and that 
data included is consistent AGMA Councils have been working together 
during 2017 on agreeing a common data set. The majority of other 
AGMA Councils will also do this and therefore AGMA comparative 
figures will be published by 31 March 2018.

11.5 Stockport is a supportive and flexible employer with a range of flexible 

working patterns and models available to employees, these include, 
flexible working, term time, part time, job share, agile and home working 
along with a “blind” recruitment process. Stockport also has a number of 
female role models in senior management positions. The Council’s GPG 
is low with only small percentage differences of 2.79% in the mean 
hourly rate and 1.81% in the median hourly rate. Full details are shown 
in appendix one. This is the first time Stockport has produced GPG 
information so it is not currently possible to view trends. Work will 
continue to ensure the GPG is improved including: identifying areas 
where it is difficult for female workers to access, improving career 
development opportunities and continuing to work with AGMA 
colleagues to learn from good practice. 

12. Future Legislation

12.1 The Council will fully comply with changes to legislation in relation to 

remuneration and exit payment requirements should legislation change.

13. Publication

13.1 Upon approval by the full Council, this statement will be published on the 

Councils website.
