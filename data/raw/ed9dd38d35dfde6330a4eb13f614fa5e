Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Executive Summary

The continuing shortage of “STEM” (Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Maths) skills in the UK are a matter of great concern for the 
construction industry as a whole, and for our own business. The 
construction industry continues to lag behind other industries with 
regard to the diversity of its talent base, particularly in respect of gender 
diversity. According to statistics from the Women’s Engineering Society, 
just 9% of UK engineers are female.

The benefits of a diverse workforce are 
well-documented, and the Partners at 
Cundall have always recognised the 
impact that different perspectives can 
have on our business and on the work 
that we do for our clients.

We are therefore committed to building 
and maintaining a broad base of talent, 
for the benefit of our business and our 
clients.  

This report presents statistical data 
regarding Cundall’s (UK) workforce, 
and sets out some of the key steps we 
are taking to attract and nurture more 
diversity, for the benefit of our own 
business and the wider industry. Whilst 
this report focuses solely on gender 
issues, we have plans to look at other 
areas of diversity and inclusion, as 
detailed in this report. 

1. We are proud of our track record in 
hiring and promoting female talent: 

  27% of UK-based members of our 

Management Board are female; 

  22% of the attendees at our October 

2016 “Leadership Forum” were 
female; 

4. We are working proactively to 
promote our own organisation, 
and the industry more generally, to 
current and future female talent. For 
instance:

  We are active members of the 

“Women’s Engineering Society”; 

  Across the 2015 and 2016 calendar 

  We are building strong links with the 

Girls’ Day School Trust; 

  We specifically target female 

students for our VIth Form 
scholarships (in partnership with the 
Arkwright Trust); 

  We encourage our female engineers 
to mentor students through our work 
with the Engineering Development 
Trust, to provide strong female role 
models to future generations.
  We have plans to further our  
 
  work on diversity and inclusion in    
  2017/18, and further information is  
  set out in this report.  

5. In 2016/17, 23% of the participants 
on our “Aspire” programme (which 
seeks to identify and develop high 
potential future leaders) are female, 
and 40% of those identified as “top 
talent” are women.

years, 20% of our Graduate new 
hires were female;

  17% of our engineering and 

technical (client-facing) staff are 
female –ahead of the industry 
benchmark.

2. Our mean gender pay gap (ie the 

difference between the mean 
average salaries of men and 
women within our business) of 26% 
compares favourably with other 
professional services firms, but we 
recognise that we have work to do to 
close the gap further.

3. When average salaries are examined 

by grade, the gender pay gap 
narrows significantly. The worst-
performing grade (in gender pay 
gap terms) shows a gender pay 
gap of 7.66% on this measure. 
Encouragingly, one of our more 
senior technical grades shows a 
positive differential of 11.23% in 
favour of women’s salaries, when 
analysed on this measure.

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 20171.0 Perspectives

A view from the top

I have been in the construction industry for over 30 years, working on 
projects throughout the world. Amongst the huge variety of projects on 
which I’ve worked are educational buildings which provide a place for 
young people learn, hospitals in which the sick are treated, and airport 
buildings which allow people to travel and experience the world.   

During this time, I’ve been fortunate to have worked with some 
incredibly talented people of different genders, ages, ethnicities and 
professional backgrounds, and I have absolutely no doubt that it is only 
through attracting and nurturing a diverse range of high calibre talent 
that businesses (in whatever sector) will continue to survive and thrive. 

Having forged my career in the built environment, I believe that we 
have a responsibility to think differently about design, so that our work 
benefits not only those who will use our buildings today, but also future 
generations, society as a whole and this planet that we all share.  

It therefore troubles me that women continue to make up an 
embarrassingly small percentage of the workforce in our industry. I’m 
immensely proud of what this business has achieved in the last 40 
years, but just imagine how great we could be if we harnessed the 
untapped potential of all the women out there who (for whatever reason) 
are not joining or staying in our industry! 

I’m pleased to champion the work that we have started to do on diversity 
and inclusion within our business. We have a long way to go, and there 
is undoubtedly much that we can learn from our peers within and 
outside our industry. This report establishes a baseline; from here we 
move forward, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you.

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 2017A different perspective

This report has been prepared in 
consultation with stakeholders within 
the business, including our elected 
(UK) Staff Forum, and a number of 
our female engineers. As part of that 
consultation process, we invited one 
of our female engineers to contribute 
her own perspective on working life 
at Cundall. The writer started her 
career with Cundall immediately after 
graduating from university, and has 
been with the business for several 
years. She has worked in offices within 
the UK and internationally, as both a 
Graduate Engineer and an Engineer. 
Her commentary is reproduced on an 
anonymous basis. 

“When I joined Cundall as a Graduate, I remember being amazed at the induction 
day to see that the new starters were almost 50% women that year. It is difficult to 
describe how exciting it is to see yourself represented on this scale, but I think the 
other women felt the same. Since then, I have had some amazing experiences - 
I have had the chance to work with and learn from some brilliant people on a range 
of interesting and challenging projects, and have met people from across the 
company.

There have been times, however, when I have faced challenges. These events are 
minor, but still occur with disappointing frequency. I will often have male colleagues 
talking over me at meetings or having conversations in my presence which I 
consider inappropriate. This can be difficult to discuss with others - each incident 
seems minor, so you worry that if you say something, you might be labelled as 
‘difficult’ and not be taken seriously.

We need to support the women (and indeed all underrepresented groups) in the 
company. This report is a huge step forward in encouraging transparency and 
discussion, and I am proud to be part of a company that is addressing this. Open 
discussion makes discrimination of any kind much harder to maintain.

More support is also needed, so that those who want to drive change within the 
business can speak up and contribute their ideas, without fear of being told to “be 
patient”.  When you tell someone in an underrepresented group not to push so hard, 
you are asking them to put up with inequality. It is difficult to hear this from people 
who may not experience it.

The people who are in these underrepresented groups can’t be expected to solve 
the problem alone. We need everyone to share the burden with us. We need to 
understand that other people have different experiences from us, and we have to 
take them at face value. I have already seen attitudes start to change, and knowing 
how many brilliant people work for Cundall, I am confident that we can continue this 
progress.”

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 20172.0 Introduction and context

This report presents statistical data regarding gender diversity at 
Cundall, and commentary relating to these statistics. It sets out some of 
the key steps that we are taking to improve gender diversity within our 
business.

Whilst the impetus for analysing our 
gender pay came initially as a result of 
the introduction of legislation in the UK 
(the “Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017), we have 
taken this opportunity to go further than 
our statutory obligations. Our compliance 
obligations require only that we analyse 
and report on our basic gender pay gap 
data (including mean and median basic 
salary and bonus information, and pay 
quartiles). However, in diving further 
into our data and exploring (in dialogue 
with our people) the reasons behind the 
gender pay gap, we intend to go beyond 
statutory obligations, establishing a 
baseline set of data and using this drive 
action within the business that we hope 
will lead to positive change.   

The “mean” figure on each measure 
was calculated by adding together all 
of the salaries (or bonus payments) in 
the sample, then dividing the total figure 
by the number of salaries (or bonus 
payments) in the sample. The “median” 
figures represent the mid-point in each 
list of numbers. The distribution of 
salaries in each office means that the 
“mean” and “median” figures can look 
quite different, when the calculations are 
undertaken. 

It is worth noting that the offices that 
make up the sample vary in size, from 
just six people, up to over 150 people. In 
statistical terms, the difference in sample 
size means that there is more likely to be 
a pay gap (in either direction) in a smaller 
office than in a larger one.  

Except where otherwise stated, data 
relates to staff paid through our UK 
PAYE payroll on 28 April 2017. Contract/
agency staff and Partners within the 
business (who are self-employed) are 
therefore excluded.  

 

4

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 20173.0 Statistical data

Gender diversity

This section presents raw data regarding the demographics within our 
UK business, as at April 2017. 

At the date of reporting, 27% of our payrolled staff were female.

This compares very favourably with 
figures for the construction industry as a 
whole, in which women are reported (by 
the Union of Construction, Allied Trades 
and Technicians) to make up just 11% of 
the total workforce.  

The Partners who lead our business 
are excluded from the majority of the 
statistical data set out in this report (due 
to being the owners of the business, and 
therefore self-employed). However, just 
8.5% of this group is female. 

We are encouraged by the fact that 
27% of our UK-based Management 
Board population is female. However, 
we recognise that this statistic is heavily 
influenced by the presence of functional 
directors from non-engineering functions 
on the board. We know that female 
engineering talent is under-represented 
in senior roles, and on our Management 
Board in particular, and that we have 
further work to do to ensure that we 
retain our female talent and provide 
equality of opportunity for all to progress 
to more senior roles within the business.  

We are making positive progress with 
regard to the identification of future 
(female) leadership talent. The most 
recent iteration of our flagship high 
potential leadership programme - 
“Aspire” - began in autumn 2016, 
and 23% of the participants on this 
programme are female. Whilst this is 
broadly in line with the demographics 
for the business as a whole, it is 
encouraging to note that, of the 
individuals identified as “top talent” 
through this programme, 40% are 
women.

Contextual information

We have calculated our “gender pay gap” based on our April 2017 
payroll and using guidance from the UK government with regard to 
how the data should be analysed. It should be noted, however, that this 
analysis takes no account of the demographics of our workforce. In 
particular, it does not allow for an analysis of pay data by “job type”, nor 
by geographic region. We have therefore included some commentary 
later in this report which provides some context for the figures shown.

Job Roles and Functions

Salaries are typically affected by a variety 
of factors, in particular the nature of the 
work being undertaken, with job roles 
and functions being a significant factor 
in determining pay rates. The gender 
split within our business is very different 
for engineering/technical functions, 
as compared with administrative/ 
professional support functions.

Typically, the “market rate” for 
administrative and professional 
support roles is lower than for qualified 
technical positions, meaning that the 
preponderance of women in these 
roles within our business has a direct 
impact on our raw gender pay gap data. 
We continue to work hard to attract 
and retain women in technical roles - 
addressing the gender imbalance will 
help to rebalance gender pay within the 
business. 

6

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Geographical Spread

Proportion of male/female employees by UK office location

Geographical location is another factor 
which has a significant impact on pay. 
The majority of our central support 
services are located in our Head Office 
in Newcastle upon Tyne, where “market-
rate” salaries are generally substantially 
lower than in some other parts of the 
United Kingdom, to reflect a much lower 
cost of living. The gender balance in 
these kinds of roles is more heavily 
weighted towards women, meaning 
that we employ a significantly higher 
proportion of female staff in locations 
where salary scales are typically lower.  

Thus, the impact of the demographics of 
our workforce on our gender pay gap is 
magnified by these regional differentials.

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Gender pay gap figures

Against the contextual background described above, we report our 
gender pay gap figures as at April 2017 below:

Median

Mean

Our mean gender pay gap stands at 
26%.

The mean female hourly rate was 
£14.81, and the mean male hourly 
rate was £20.02.

Once again, when the workforce is sub-
divided into those occupying “technical” 
and “non-technical” roles, the gender 
pay gap narrows for the former category 
(to 17.4%), but increases for “non-
technical” staff (to 33.1%). The difference 
in gender pay for non-technical roles 
is attributable (in part) to the fact that 
several of our more senior non-technical 
staff are male, and based in London, 
where salary levels are typically higher.  

Our median gender pay gap stands at 
29.6%. This reflects the difference in 
median hourly rates for men and women 
across the UK business.

The median female hourly rate was 
£12.87, and the median male hourly rate 
was £18.28. 

If we break our workforce down into 
“technical” and “non-technical” staff, the 
gender pay gap narrows significantly 
in the former category, standing at just 
6.4%. However, this does highlight a 
(surprising) disparity in gender pay within 
our “non-technical” (support) roles, 
where the gender pay gap stands at 
36.8%.

This analysis suggests that, whilst we 
have enjoyed some success in attracting 
women to our business for “early 
career” and less senior roles, women 
are under-represented at a more senior 
level. Whilst this is attributable in part to 
a long-standing gender imbalance within 
the industry, we believe that we can and 

must do more to ensure that we retain, 
nurture and develop a broad base of 
talent, and provide opportunities for all to 
grow into more senior roles. To this end, 
some of the actions identified later in this 
report are focused on nurturing existing 
talent, to support this objective.

Whilst we are not obliged to report on 
our gender pay gap by region, we have 
taken this opportunity to review our 
pay data on a regional basis, to test 
our hypothesis that some of the gap is 
attributable to the geographical spread 
of our roles. The output from this analysis 
is set out below.

We note the existence of a negative 
gender pay gap in one office (albeit 
based on a very small sample size). Our 
commitment is to fairness, and we have 
therefore done some further analysis 
to identify and understand the reasons 
behind this. The sample size in this 
office is small, and the gender balance 
is different to that seen elsewhere in 
the business; we are satisfied that this 
explains this anomaly.

Bonus Data

We have analysed our bonus data for 
the 12 months to 28 April 2017. For the 
purposes of this calculation, “bonus pay” 
includes:

  Discretionary profit shares
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Joining bonuses
 Chartership bonuses
 “Recommend a Friend” bonuses
 Discretionary bonuses
 Prizes
 Christmas bonuses
 Long service bonuses

In this period, 97% of female employees 
received a bonus, and 94% of male 
employees received a bonus.

The mean female bonus pay was 
£216.09, and the mean male bonus pay 
was £403.37, giving a mean bonus pay 
gap of 46.4%. However, the median 
bonus pay for both male and female 
employees was £25, giving a median 
bonus pay gap of 0%. 

This difference in the gender pay gap 
across the mean and median figures 
arises as a result of the fact that the 
majority of our workforce received a 
discretionary Christmas gift of high 
street shopping vouchers, which was 
fixed at a standard £300 per employee. A 
smaller proportion of our workforce (at a 
senior level) are entitled to be considered 
for a discretionary bonus, by way of 
a share of the business’s profits. The 
bonuses awarded under this scheme are 
typically of a substantially higher value. 
Due to the profile of our workforce (as 
reported above), a greater number of 
male employees than female employees 
received this higher-value bonus, 
affecting the mean figure.

Whilst the government framework 
does not require (nor permit, on the 
governmental website) organisations to 
report on their gender pay gap by job 
role, we have nonetheless undertaken 
this analysis, to establish whether there 
are disparities between men’s and 
women’s salaries in particular job roles. 
This measure eliminates the contextual 
factors which can affect the gender pay 
gap figures at an organisational level 
(as described), and allows for a side-by-
side comparison of salaries by gender 
for the same job roles. This analysis 
presents a much more encouraging 
picture with regard to the equivalency 
of male and female salaries within the 
business, as shown below. The gender 
pay gap on this measure is largest at 
Senior Engineer grade (at 7.66%). We are 
also aware that women are particularly 
under-represented at this grade within 
the business. Encouragingly, the gender 
pay gap for more senior technical roles 
is much narrower, and we evidence 
a negative gender pay gap for roles 
at Principal Engineer (-0.28%) and 
Associate (-11.23%) grades.  

10

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Industry Benchmarks

Whilst recognising that we have work 
to do to address the gender pay gap 
within our own business, we have also 
taken this opportunity to benchmark our 
own data against some of the available 
statistical data.

At the date of writing, only a small 
number of employers have published 
their Gender Pay Gap data via the 
government’s official website, with only 
four of these being from the construction 
industry. The majority of firms who have 
published are from the public, social care 
or third sectors, or manufacturing. 

The construction industry employers 
who have reported their data at the time 
of writing are reporting a gender pay gap 
of between 1.9% and 32.6% based on 
the mean average figure, and between 
7% and 39.9% based on the median 
average.

The only professional services employers 
to have published are Deloitte and 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, who reported  
mean gender pay gaps of 20.4% and 
33.1%, and median gender pay gaps 
of 17.8% and 34.4%, respectively. It is 
interesting to note that PWC’s gender 
pay gap is larger than Cundall’s, despite 
them reporting a higher percentage 
of women in their upper- and upper 
middle pay quartiles (36.7% and 49.7% 
respectively). In relation to bonus pay, 
PWC report their gender pay gap as 
being 58.6% (mean) and 67.1% (median), 
whilst Deloitte reported a gap of 50.3% 
(mean) and 38.7% (median).

The provisional results from the Office 
for National Statistics’ “Annual Survey 
of Hours and Earnings”, published in 
October 2016, suggest that the gender 
pay gap in 2016 across all industries 
stands at 18.1% (down from 19.3% the 
previous year).  

2015 data from the ICAEW (a 
professional body for Accountancy and 
Finance professionals) suggests that the 
gender pay gap for ICAEW Chartered 
Accountants working in business is 
actually widening, with the gap standing 
at 36.6%. 

There is limited gender pay gap 
information for the construction 
industry in the public domain at this 
time. However, the benchmarking 
data available for 2016 through the 
Association of Consultancy and 
Engineering suggests that we lag 
behind our direct industry competitors in 
gender diversity amongst our technical 
workforce; 17% of our fee earners 
are women, with the industry average 
standing at 23%.  

11

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 20175.0  Current and future action

There continues to be a significant gender imbalance within our 
industry as a whole. Statistics from the Women’s Engineering Society 
present a similarly bleak picture with regard to the pipeline of future 
talent; just 15.8% of engineering and technology students in the UK 
are female, with no real progress in the last five years. In light of this, 
eliminating the gender pay gap within the next five years is unrealistic. 
We have therefore set ourselves the challenge of doing so over the next 
10 years and set ourselves on course to do so now. 

The analysis we have undertaken, as 
summarised in this report, suggests that 
the wider issue of gender imbalance 
within our own business and the 
wider industry is one of the key factors 
contributing to the gender pay gap. We 
are taking positive action to improve 
the diversity of our workforce, in the 
expectation that this will directly improve 
pay equality within our business. 

2. Matching some of those we have 
identified as “high potential future 
leaders” with existing leaders (male 
and female) within the business, to 
provide positive role models and 
careers guidance. 

3.  Specifically targeting female students 

for our VIth Form scholarships (in 
partnership with the Arkwright Trust); 

4.  Encouraging our female engineers 

to mentor students through our work 
with the Engineering Development 
Trust, to provide strong female role 
models to future generations;

5.  Hosting events in our UK and 

international offices and posting a 
number of diversity-related blogs, to 
align with “International Women in 
Engineering Day”.

To date, this has included:

1. Working proactively to promote our 
own organisation and the industry 
more generally to current and future 
talent (in particular female talent). For 
instance: 

  We support the work of the 

“Women’s Engineering Society”, as 
subscribers; 

  We were a headline sponsor of 
the IET’s Women in Engineering 
conference in 2017; 

  We are building strong links with the 
Girls’ Day School Trust. As a result of 
this relationship, we have: 

 − Hosted open days in some of our 
UK offices for young women who 
might be considering careers in 
our industry;

 − Fielded (female) speakers to 

run workshops at their annual 
conference; 

 −  Participated in “Women Leaders 

Events”, to provide careers 
guidance and mentoring to young 
women.

12

Taking Action on Gender Diversity - Gender Pay Gap Report 2017In the immediate term, we consider 
the issue of gender diversity to be of 
paramount importance to our business 
and our industry, and we have therefore 
decided to tackle this as a strategic 
priority. Once our work in this area is 
more embedded within our business, 
we intend to broaden our diversity and 
inclusion strategy to address more 
specifically other areas, including 
ethnicity, disability and sexuality. 

Moving forward, we have plans to further our work on diversity and inclusion in 
2017/18, and planned activities include: 

1. “Peer-to-peer” meetings for our 

senior leaders with other businesses 
in our industry, to share knowledge, 
experiences and best practice;

2. Benchmarking of our own gender 

pay gap data against that of our 
industry peers, once this is publicly 
available, to help us understand 
better how we perform in 
comparison with the others, and the 
extent to which gender pay issues 
are specific to our business, or 
endemic within the wider industry; 

leave or other career break, to 
ease their transition back into the 
workplace, and provide support; 

6. Further discussions with academic 

providers about executive 
development programmes targeted 
specifically at women leaders, to 
support and nurture female talent 
within the business; 

7. The extension of gender pay gap
