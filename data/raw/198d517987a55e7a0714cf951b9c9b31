It is the nature of our culture and business to ensure that every individual 
feels valued in their own right. 
 
We believe our gender pay gap statistics for 2017 reflect our efforts to 
demonstrate this and achieve fairness and equity in our pay.  Whilst not 
perfect, they are considerably better than the national average, and we are 
committed to ongoing action to reduce the gaps. 
 
As part of our commitment to ensuring we have the right balance of genders 
and pay within our workforce we have been working with, and will continue 
to work with, our consultants to help us identify, review and address any 
underlying issues using appropriate tools (such as job evaluation) and good 
employment practices to support this.
