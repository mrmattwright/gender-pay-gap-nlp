"I am delighted that South Norfolk Council has a Gender Pay Gap of near parity, showing minimal difference between the mean average hourly rate of pay for both men and women.  This demonstrates the success of our Moving Forward Together approach - encompassing our culture and organisational values.  "Although positive, our report shows a median (mid-point) hourly pay rate which states that the average hourly rate of pay is actually 14.8% higher for women than for men – Our action plan will therefore focus on attaining even greater diversity in the workplace and we will continue to encourage and support all our employees to fulfil their full potential.”    Sandra Dinneen Chief Executive South Norfolk Council  March 2018  Download our Gender Pay Statement here.
