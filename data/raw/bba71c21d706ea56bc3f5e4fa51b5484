It replaces all our previous equality policies and schemes with a single policy that sets out the key principles that guide the way in which the Council makes decisions, provide services; recruit and support our employees; work with other organisations; and involve local people. It will be supported by strategies and action plans that set out the objectives and activities that will ensure we meet our Equality Duty. You can download the Equality Policy by clicking below, and can also link to a webpage that brings together our main plans and strategies that are helping us to tackle inequality.
