Our business approach is grounded in beliefs which seek to integrate and maintain practices that promote positive contribution to local life whilst finding innovative ways to minimise the environmental impact on the communities in which we operate. Central to this strategy is the strength of the ongoing relationship that Grange Hotels continues to develop with its employees, guests, partners, and stakeholders. Grange Hotels places responsibility at the core of what we do and focuses that into four key areas.   Business Relationships  Grange Hotels prides itself on the exemplary values and standards that it sets whilst establishing a process whereby illegal unethical behaviour can be freely reported and quickly addressed. We make sure that we use our skills and experience to provide products and services of a high exacting standard rightfully expected by our clients while continually striving to reduce the impact we have on the natural environment and communities in which we conduct business. We set ourselves high standards in the way we serve our customers. On the occasions that we regrettably fail, we have in place a complaints policy to ensure that clients’ concerns are dealt with efficiently, swiftly and fairly to find a resolution that best solves the situation. Believing in a partnership approach to supply chain relations, we endeavour to use fair and transparent procurement methods while ensuring that payments are made promptly and supplier complaints are reviewed efficiently to find a mutually consensual resolution. Our overriding aim is to raise, with clients, the awareness of responsible business practice in our industry and elsewhere while helping to facilitate a change in approach to minimise impact on the natural environment and communities in which we operate.  Diversity and Equal Opportunities  As a group we are committed to a policy of equal opportunities and fairness within the workplace.  We are proud of and value the diversity of our colleagues, customers, stakeholders, and those living within our local communities. Grange Hotels have procedures in place whereby employees and others can raise their views or concerns freely and without fear.  We strive to engage our employees in all major changes and issues that will affect both the working environment and the company itself. Moreover we place great importance on providing a safe and secure working environment where the health and welfare of our staff is of paramount importance.  Further to this position we recognise the importance and benefit to the company in the continuing development of our staff to which end we do our best to provide all staff with support, training and the opportunities to grow within their potential.  We look for those that achieve the best they can through appraisals based not just on results but how those results were achieved and will reward all who strive to excel and exceed in their roles. We are proud of the wide range of backgrounds from which we recruit and embrace those talented individuals who bring their own areas of experience and help to build and develop our areas of business. We also look to purchase goods, services, and develop facilities which reflect our policies on equality and diversity.  We apply our policies across the board and ensure that suppliers from diverse communities have equal opportunity in tendering for contracts.  We expect our suppliers in turn to comply with and support our efforts to spread good practice in diversity and equal opportunities.  Gender Pay Gap Report  UK legislation requires that all UK companies employing at least 250 people, publish differences in average hourly pay and bonus pay between their male and female employees; the proportion of men and women receiving bonuses; and the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the organisation’s pay structure. In accordance with these regulations, we published our 2017 UK Gender Pay Gap Report on 29 March, 2018.

To this end we place great emphasis on developing strong environmental practices and operating all parts of our business in a sustainable and responsible manner. We are strongly committed to reducing our environmental impact and strive to reduce our carbon footprint in all the communities where we operate. Continually reviewing and improving our environmental performance is key within our strategic development. We are constantly on the lookout for new and innovative ways in which to meet our high environmentally-friendly targets. We aim to achieve this by doing the following:   Minimise consumption of natural resources through the use of modern technologies to reduce our reliance on non-renewable sources (this includes the use of solar panels, bore holes, ‘green roofs’, HVAC systems, and Combined Heat and Power Systems).  Waste reduction through the encouraging of re-use and recycling as well as the limiting of environmentally hazardous materials where alternatives are economically suitable.  The incorporation of environmental considerations into procurement decisions to drive our collective impact on the environment.  We encourage all our staff and customers to do all they can to help reduce environmental impact of modern business, including showing how to use environmentally sensitive transport methods where possible.   We regularly review our environmental policies and continually evolve them to make sure we are doing our best not just to lower our impact on the environments in which we work but also to enlighten others within our industry in the ways we can all reduce businesses impact on the environment wherever we happen to be.  Community Engagement  Grange Hotels believe it is our responsibility to engage the communities in which we work through investment and development.
