The report shows a mean pay gap of only 2.25% which is substantially better than the comparable figure reported by almost all similar London firms.  Commenting on the report Paul Roberts, Managing Partner, said: " I am pleased but not surprised that Forsters' mean pay figures show only a very small gap between the average pay for female and male staff. We pride ourselves on providing equal opportunities for all. The mean pay figures as outlined in our report show how well we are doing in this area.  Whilst the median pay gap is larger this reflects the make up of our work force. Indeed when we break down our figures into quartiles (based on pay) we see that on average female staff are paid more than men in three of the four quartiles . ”  Smita Edwards, Senior Partner, added: “ Forsters has an exceptional track record in terms of diversity. Female leadership has always played an important and influential part in the growth of the Firm. In the partnership, 44% of our partners (23 out of 52) are female. Eleven female partners are in leadership positions including our senior partner. Women head four of our six business service groups. ”  As a firm, we are committed to seeing each and every one of our people realise their potential in a diverse and inclusive working environment and welcome the introduction of gender pay gap reporting. We will work to reduce or eliminate any gap that exists. Gender equality and diversity and inclusion are important issues for Forsters, and will remain at the top of the firm’s agenda over the next 12 months as we seek to continue to attract, recruit, develop and retain the best possible talent.
