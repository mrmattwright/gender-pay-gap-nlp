This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of men and women in our organisation; it will not involve publishing individual employees data.  We are required to publish the results on our own website and a government website. We will do this within one calendar year of April 5th 2017.  We can use these results to assess: •	the levels of gender equality in our workplace •	the balance of male and female employees at different levels •	how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded.  The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gap.  Our report is inclusive of Agency Workers whome which we habve do direct control of pay rate. The sectors we supply tend to be male dominated including Logistics and Warhouseing. Our permanent employees represent less than 1% of the data.
