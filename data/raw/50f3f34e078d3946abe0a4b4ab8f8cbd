Edinburgh Zoo  With over 1,000 animals, 82 acres of parkland and over 600,000 visitors a year to look after, the task of running the Zoo can be complex and challenging.  The Zoo employs over 200 members of staff, plus approximately 100 additional seasonal staff every year, with skills ranging from animal welfare and management, to teaching, presenting, gardening, design, joinery, painting, finance, IT, HR, marketing, fundraising, catering, visitor services and retail.  Highland Wildlife Park  The Highland Wildlife Park is located in the Cairngorms National Park, 7 miles south of Aviemore.  We are a relatively small organisation, employing a small visitor services team with seasonal staff in the cafe, shop and gate and just ten full time animal keepers. All our keepers are required to have, or to be training towards, an appropriate zoo animal management qualification.
