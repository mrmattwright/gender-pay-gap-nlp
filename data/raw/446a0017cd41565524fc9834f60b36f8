The College is committed to providing a learning and working environment free from discrimination, harassment or victimisation; in which each individual is treated with respect and dignity, and is able to fulfil his or her potential.  At Hills Road, we seek to create an environment that is open and accessible, where diversity and individual choice are respected, thus enabling every member of our community to participate fully in College life.    Equality and Diversity Report 2016-17  Gender Pay Gap Reporting  SES Development Plan  Single Equality Scheme   Disability We are committed to meeting the needs of people with disabilities, recognising that a disability can affect people in different ways. We encourage people with disabilities to make relevant staff aware of their needs so that full and appropriate support may be provided.  We are very pleased to have had the opportunity, in partnership with DisabledGo , to improve further our support for disabled members of the College community.   Hearing impaired/deaf Loop systems are installed at reception desks in the Main Building, The Guidance Suite and the Sports and Tennis Centre. The Robinson Theatre, College Hall, The Colin Hill Recital Room, Science Lecture Room in The Rob Wilkinson Building and Sports Hall in the Sports and Tennis Centre are also equipped with a loop system. Additional communication support can be organised by arrangement with trained staff from the Study Skills Centre .   Visually impaired/blind Trained staff from the Study Skills Centre provide specialist support to visually impaired students. They arrange for course materials and hand-outs to be produced in suitable formats - such as audiotapes, Braille and large print and, where appropriate, they support students during their lessons.   Specific learning difficulties Staff from the Study Skills Centre have experience of supporting students with specific learning difficulties including dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD and other conditions within the Autistic Spectrum, such as Asperger’s Syndrome. Due to the nature of the site access to some areas of the College is limited.   Aids to accessibility Most ground floors are accessible via power assisted doors. A number of lifts give access to most upper floors and classrooms. Wherever possible, given prior notification, adjustments will be made to facilitate individual needs.   Site Plan The College site plan indicates lift locations, accessible toilets, those entrance doors which have level thresholds, enabling access for wheel chairs, and wheelchair routes throughout the College. For more detailed information about accessibility, please visit the College's section of the DisabledGo site.   Mental Health The first source of advice, guidance and support for a student with a mental health disability is normally his or her tutor. In addition, the College’s Student Services Team offer help to students if they're feeling unwell, unsure or if they just need someone to speak to.  Our Wellbeing Adviser is a key part of the Student Services Team and has the time available to talk through any worries or concerns students may have. The Wellbeing Adviser is also able to refer students on to our in-house counselling service, or to external sources of support, should that be appropriate.   The Study Skills Centre The Study Skills Centre is available to all students throughout their course. Trained staff will help you analyse your individual learning needs and plan support. Individual and small-group support is available for a variety of needs. Assessment for specific learning difficulties can be arranged by the team.
