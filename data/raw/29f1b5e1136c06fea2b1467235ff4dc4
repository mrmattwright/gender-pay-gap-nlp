Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2017

Our data

When  calculating  the  difference 
in  average 
earnings, the gender pay gap takes into account 
all  jobs,  at  all  levels  and  salaries  within  an 
organisation.  This  means  the  gender  pay  gap 
indicates the level of roles that women carry out 
in an organisation. The roles that women carry out 
can  result  from  many  different  factors,  such  as 
historic trends of one gender dominating certain 
industries and type of jobs.

We are confident that men and women are paid equally 
for  doing  equivalent  jobs  across  our  business.  We 
appoint people to roles based on merit and regardless 
of age, race, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, 
disability or religion and belief. 

We  value  the  contribution  made  by  all  our  employees 
and are committed to creating a workplace environment 
where  they  want  to  stay,  progress  and  develop  their 
career  with  us,  and  we  will  continue  to  support  all 
employees across all roles to reach their potential. 

What action are we  
taking?

Whilst we have ongoing educational partnerships and a 
number of our employees are active STEM Ambassadors, 
we are committed to taking a structured approach to help 
us  achieve  a  more  appropriate  gender  balance  in  the 
future.

Whilst  our  gender  pay  gap  of  17.8%  is  lower  than  the  UK 
average  and  the  average  of  the  construction  industry, 
we  recognise  that  women  are  under-represented  in  our 
workforce, particularly within operational roles, and there is 
work to do to improve our gender representation across our 
business.

The Government’s calculation method does not take 
into account employee eligability to receive a bonus.
When this is taken into account it shows a truer

The figures (below) show the gender distribution at JN Bentley across four equally 
sized  quartiles  (in  this  case  270  employees  in  each)  from  the  highest  to  lowest 
earners. Whilst we do have females carrying out senior roles within the business, 
we seek to increase the gender representation across the business and for this to be 
consistently spread across all four quartiles as individuals progress.
