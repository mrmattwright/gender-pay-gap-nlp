In our experience, diversity of talent and thought are what drive innovation. Our most creative teams are those that tap into dissimilar perspectives and ideas, turning unique thinking into one-of-a-kind solutions. This allows us to ensure that:  the company retains, attracts and develops world-class people.  people are treated with dignity and respect, and difference is valued as a company core competency.  employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, perform at their peak level and make their maximum contribution.  we enjoy world-class partnerships with our customers, suppliers, partners and other stakeholders.  We believe in creating an inclusive environment and providing an atmosphere where everyone feels valued and empowered.  At Raytheon UK, each employee operates under the goal of "furthering a culture of high performance and innovation through talent management, inclusion and diversity of thought". To assist in the successful completion of this goal, Raytheon UK has appointed a member of its Leadership Team as the Executive Champion for Diversity and Inclusion to ensure that diversity and inclusion is at the heart of the business' strategic focus.  The goal of Raytheon UK's Diversity and Inclusion Council, formed in 2010, is to drive organisational and individual capability whilst supporting the business strategy and an engaged workforce. The Council is made up of volunteers from across Raytheon UK's sites and business areas. Some of the activities which the Council is responsible for include: providing training on diversity and inclusion, hosting external speakers to discuss diversity and inclusion themes, raising awareness of topical issues, and, assisting Raytheon UK leaders in creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace.  Raytheon UK has invested in a number of employee resource groups with particular focus areas including the Raytheon Women's Network (RWN UK) and Raytheon Reservists. RWN UK provides a network to foster, celebrate and advocate for women's success and exposure. The Raytheon Reservists group was formed to provide support for reservists and veterans under the Armed Forces covenant which Raytheon UK signed in 2014. Its special focus is to support for the UK armed forces and those members of the Armed Forces Reservists who work within Raytheon.  Raytheon is also active in local communities, particularly through engagement with local schools as part of the Raytheon STEM programme. This corporate social responsibility programme aims to encourage greater participation in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects with a large emphasis on encouraging more women into these areas.  Put simple, diversity of talent and thought is key to our ability to provide solutions to the global market. And if we are to truly make the world a safer place, our organisation must reflect that world. We continue to strive to build a culture around recognising, respecting and leveraging difference. Now, as the global environment rapidly evolves and grows ever more competitive, the next chapter in our journey to inclusiveness will be critical.
