The design offices at Wipac place talented mechanical, optical, thermal and electronics engineers together with open access to facilities from advanced CAE simulation to a fully equipped photometric laboratory. This approach allows fast testing and development of new ideas in an environment that actively encourages creativity.  + More about innovation            With many of our headlamps featured on supercars capable of speeds well above 200mph it is no surprise that the performance of Wipac forward lighting systems has to be world leading.  Wipac’s most recent forward lighting projects increase on HID xenon performance by adding driving (high beam) functions in LED – this solution gives the highest levels of road illumination combined with accurate colour rendering for improved depth perception.  + More about performance            Our customers use the form and detail of their exterior lights to emphasise the character of their cars and ultimately to define their brands. At Wipac the styling requirements are treated as a critical part of the product specification and we pride ourselves on our proven ability to create production lighting designs stunningly close to the original concepts.  + More about style     Our products   Xenon Headlamp with LED high beam View our products News 30 Mar 2017 Carclo Acquisition of FLTC Carclo announces that its UK subsidiary, Carclo Overseas Holdings LTD.
