As a social value based organisation, we’re passionate about being able to lead by example when it comes to inclusivity, and we’re committed to reflecting through our workforce the equality and diversity of the clients and communities we work with. This includes addressing gender equality and supporting women in the workplace.  We are publishing our first gender pay report for 2017-18 which can be downloaded here .
