As an employer with over 250 employees Clifton College is required by law to publish an annual 
gender pay gap report on our website and on the government’s online reporting service by 4th 
April 2018.   This is the report for the snapshot date of 5th April 2017. 

•  The proportion of male and female employees in each pay quartile are:

•  The median gender bonus gap is 0%.

female employees receiving a bonus is 0.69%. 

 
 
The College employs a majority of female staff in each quartile although the top quartile is the 
most evenly balanced.  Overall women comprise 62.14% of staff employed by the College.   

The College is committed to the principles of equality in the workplace.  We undertake annual 
salary reviews for both support and teaching employees.  Teaching staff are remunerated through 
Salary Bands, which rewards them for their professional and wider contributions to the College, 
along with their level of experience.  Support staff remuneration reflects the value and complexity 
of the work undertaken.  We look to benchmark our salaries externally, where possible.  Male and 
female employees at Clifton College are treated equally on appointment and throughout their 
careers at the College. 

I confirm that the calculations are an accurate representation of the College’s position as at 5th 
April 2017.
