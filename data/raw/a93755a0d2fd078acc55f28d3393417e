To us this means being a company that is recognised for attracting and employing the best, developing and realising the potential of its people.  We have already been recognised as a leading employer by Construction News, winning both Employer of the Year and Apprentice of the Year awards, in the five years since the Novus brand was established.  We are fully committed to remaining at the leading edge. This means focusing on building a more diverse workforce with opportunities for personal development and professional fulfillment for all.    Understanding our pay gap   Women’s hourly rate is 25.9% lower (mean) and 25.4% lower (median).  Top salary quartile has 93.3% men and 6.7% women  Upper middle salary quartile has 94.8% men and 5.2% women  Lower middle salary quartile has 90.3% men and 9.7% women  Lower salary quartile has 57.1% men and 42.9% women  Women’s bonus pay is 87.2% lower (mean) and 26.4% lower (median)  56.8% of men and 53.5% of women received bonus pay   Construction, as an industry, has long suffered from a lack of women joining its professions. We are actively engaged in several initiatives through Business in the Community and Women in Construction where we work alongside our peers to help develop attraction strategies to encourage more women to pursue a career in the sector.  We see a need for Government to help improve funding and resources to help encourage young women to pursue qualifications for construction while at school, tackling the issue at its source.  We are committed to finding the best person for every role, irrespective of their gender, but are working hard to ensure our business represents an attractive career option for everyone, to increase the number of female applicants we receive.  Our pay gap is a result of a significant majority of our workforce being men, both at an operational level and in management. Women currently represent approximately 15% of our total workforce.  Although outside the scope of reporting regulations because of its size, JSSH Limited, the Novus holding company, is proud to have an equal representation of men and women on its board. Whilst this is not yet reflected within Novus, our Board of Directors are passionate about achieving greater diversity at the senior management level. Putting the business on the path towards achieving and sustaining a diverse workforce at all levels is an important part of Novus’ long-term goals.    Closing the gap We are determined to close our gender pay gap but recognise that this will require a long-term strategic approach. Our Board is developing an action plan in response to the Gender Pay Gap report, which we will announce to our teams later this year.
