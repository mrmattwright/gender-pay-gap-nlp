We are required to publish calculations that display and help explain any gender pay gap     Data period The salary data is based on the mandatory snapshot date of 31 March 2017. This information will be updated annually. Difference to equal pay The gender pay gap is different to equal pay: the gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay of men and women equal pay relates to men and women receiving equal pay for equal work , which has been a legal requirement for over 45 years Commitment to equality and diversity in the workplace We're, of course, committed to equality and diversity. Policies and procedures are in place to ensure we pay employees fairly and equally. Our job evaluation process means that an employee's pay grade is determined by the job undertaken. There is no reference to gender or any other personal characteristics of the current or potential post holder when considering pay grade. This system ensures the same pay grade, and therefore salary, is paid to roles of equal value. Further information on our commitment to equality and diversity can be found here .
