And providing an inclusive environment where ideas are heard and debated is one of the keys to our long-term success. That's why we focus on attracting, developing and retaining the brightest talent across our business. Talented people are celebrated and valued at Schroders whatever their gender, age, race,  sexual orientation, disability, religion, beliefs or other characteristics. We pride ourselves on always being open to different ways of thinking.  Diversity and inclusion at Schroders are championed at all levels, with our Group Chief Executive, Peter Harrison, acting as our most senior sponsor. Peter, together with the Group Management Committee, is personally accountable for making sure we foster a culture that's inclusive and that strives for diversity in all that we do across our global workforce.  Diversity of thought is critical to success in modern business. At Schroders we are going a step beyond simply saying that it is important.   – Peter Harrison, Group Chief Executive    Our Diversity and Inclusion action plan          2016    2017    2018    2019       Engage with recruitment partners around diversity and inclusion  Launch employee resource groups  Capture diversity data  Review maternity and flexible working policy  Introduce transgender policy      Identify target zones and Senior Responsible Owners  Position Asset Management as an attractive industry for female and BAME talent  Introduce Mandatory inclusive leadership training for all managers  Pair top 10% of female talent with senior sponsor  Introduce 50/50 gender split at assessment centres      Introduce mandatory Diversity and Inclusion training for all employees  Pair top BAME talent with senior sponsor      Target of at least 33% women in senior management  Increase senior BAME representation            Women in Finance Charter      In May 2016, Schroders signed up to the Women in Finance Charter , a pledge for gender balance across financial services. The charter sets out to build a more gender-balanced and fair sector. Signatories pledge to commit to progressing women into senior roles, setting a strategy with measurable targets and reporting publicly on their progress.  We are committed to striving for gender equality across our business. We originally set a target of 30% female representation in senior management roles by the end of 2019, up from 25% at the end of 2015.  We achieved our 30% goal in January 2017. Following a small structural change this fell back to 29% by the end of the year. As a result of our continued progress in this area, we have increased our target to at least 33% by the end of 2019.  We see transparency around gender pay as integral to having more meaningful conversations around equality.
