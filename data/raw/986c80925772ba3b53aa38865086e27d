As at April 2017 (when the data had to be taken), there were 345 employees, of which 246 (71%) were female.  Jesuits themselves are not employees as they receive no salaries.  The Jesuits in Britain have no employee bonus scheme.  Very roughly our employees break down into the following categories: School staff at Donhead and St John’s Beaumont prep schools (teaching, pastoral and domestic) -  160 Healthcare staff at our two retirement homes - 50 Staff at our head office - 20 Domestic staff in our communities -  20 Staff in apostolic works e.g. JRS, Jesuit Missions, spirituality centres -  95 Charities are now required to show the mean (average) and median (middle) hourly pay of men and of women. For Jesuits in Britain employees, on average men are paid 3.7% more than women at £16.71 per hour compared to £16.09 per hour, based on overall numbers and not on a job like for like basis The middle-placed man is paid £14.05 per hour which is 1.5% less than the middle-placed woman on £14.26          Charities are also required to report proportions of men and women in each pay quartile As the proportion of women in the workforce as a whole is 71% it can be seen that there are proportionately more women in the middle quartiles and fewer who are paid the highest and lowest rates of pay. We also looked at the ratio between the highest paid employee and the lowest paid employee and found it to be under 7:1. Although there is not much data available, this seems to be better than for charities generally (where this ratio seems to be about 8 to 1) and definitely much better than the average ratio of 386:1 in the UK’s 100 top companies. The ratio between the highest paid employee and the average employee was 3.6 compared to 4:1 in other charities and 100:1 in the UK’s top 100 firms. When other charities start reporting their gender pay, we will be able to start making much more meaningful comparisons. Meanwhile, the Jesuits in Britain will keep these numbers under review and take action if it feels necessary.   ‹ Go back            Pause for prayer       Introduction to Walking with the risen Christ Listen now              Latest from Twitter         Jesuits in Britain  @JesuitsBritain    RT @JesuitsBritain : “It’s a little bit crazy, I know, and I will only put on the costume for the 1st time on arrival in #London the day bef…   31 min 21 sec ago.
