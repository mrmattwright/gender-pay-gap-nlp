This scam targets individuals who have registered with job search websites. Fraudulent job offers and job application forms are being sent by email enticing individuals to disclose personal information and pay money on the pretence of securing work and residence permits. Whilst these emails may appear genuine, as they make unauthorised use of the hotel’s name, logo and address, they are in fact bogus. We assure you that we’re taking all measures within our power to stop this fraudulent activity.  What do I do if I receive a bogus email?  If you receive such emails regarding hotel careers or application forms, please do not respond to them and in particular do not send any money. If you have already responded to such an email, please contact us supplying all relevant details.  How do I know if my job offer is genuine?  We always conduct at least one interview, either in person or via internet video call, during your application process. We’ll also phone or email you to discuss any potential offers. Once you have accepted, we then follow this up with an emailed offer letter from one of our HR colleagues. When conversing with the Royal Garden Hotel, the only official email domain is ‘@royalgardenhotel.co.uk’ – any variation on this is a scam.
