Cannock Chase District Council 

What is the Gender Pay Gap? 
 
 
The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the mean or median hourly rate of pay that male 
and female colleagues receive.  

The mean pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings of men and women. The median pay 
gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly earnings of men and women. It takes all 
salaries in the sample, lines them up in order from lowest to highest, and picks the middle-most salary. 

Cannock Chase District Council’s Gender Pay Gap analysis shows an overall split of 57.87% women and 
42.13 % men. Our gender pay gap analysis is based on the head count of these employees as opposed to 
full time equivalent numbers.

34.22% of the total workforce work reduced hours. The diagrams above demonstrate the split between men 
and women in terms of their respective working patterns. Within the group of male employees just 8.46% 
are employed in part time roles whereas 52.87% of all women employed by the authority undertake work 
on reduced hours (the authority considers any working pattern under 37 hours per week to be part time). 

The Council positively considers requests for flexible working across the workforce and aims to 
accommodate requests (through reduced hours, revised patterns of work and or home working) wherever 
possible in line with statutory guidance. 

 

Proportion of men and women receiving bonuses 

Cannock Chase District Council does not operate any performance related pay or bonus scheme and as 
such has no bonus related gender pay gap

Demographic across the organisation 

As a District Council we are responsible for ensuring a wide range of services are provided to our residents. 
In order to do this we employ officers from a range of backgrounds with varying practical, clerical, technical 
and professional skills. 

With this in mind we have shown below the gender split across the authority by category of role. This 
demonstrates that whilst the front line and support services are represented much more significantly by 
women; in all other areas of the organisation there is a largely balanced proportion of men and women 
even at senior management level.

Why we have a gender pay gap 

Cannock Chase Council has a mean Gender Pay Gap of 17.54%. This is below the national average of 
18.1%*. Our median Gender Pay Gap is, however slightly above the national average of 23%, sitting at 
26.92%. Looking at the profile of our workforce above it is apparent that we employee a much larger 
proportion of women than men in our Front Line and Support roles, therefore leading to a lower median rate 
of pay for females than their male colleagues. 

The Gender Pay Gap is affected by the make up of an employers’ workforce profile (57.87% women and 
42.13% men at Cannock Chase) as well as the distribution of staff across grades. 

Close to 45% of all employees in the Council are employed in Front Line & Support roles. Services which 
fall within this profile include Cleaning and Clerical roles which are largely made up of female employees 
who are often attracted to the Flexible Working provisions available in the authority; this is borne out by the 
data on page 3 of the report which shows that over half of the Council’s female employees work reduced 
hours.

Cannock Chase District Council is, however confident that men and women are paid equally for doing the 
same job. The Council uses the nationally recognised Job Evaluation Schemes for Local Government; 
Gauge (up to Chief Officer) and Hay (Chief Officers) to evaluate all roles within the authority and works 
hard to ensure our recruitment processes mean that we appoint the best candidate for every role based on 
skill and ability.

* Chartered Management institute 2016 gender Pay survey 

 

How are we aiming to reduce the gap?  

As a Council we will continue to ensure that our recruitment advertising is equally accessible to all 
candidates and that our recruitment processes continue to be based on ensuring we find the best candidate 
based on skills and abilities for any and all positions we advertise. 

Once we have appointed our people we are keen to support them in their roles and make every effort to 
positively consider requests for flexible working as well as offering opportunities for development both 
through on the job and external training and development. 

As an employer we have made use of the Apprenticeship Levy requirements in 2017/18 by upskilling our 
existing employees, particularly at the team leader and supervisor levels and will continue to do so in 
forthcoming years. In addition we hope to encourage new talent to join our organisation as we build a 
strategy to bring in new Apprentices at a variety of levels within the organisation.
