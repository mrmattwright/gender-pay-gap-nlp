The thing that’s always amazed me about SAS is its holistic integration of work and play, art and science, and business and life.  Richard Florida, Author and Economist           By taking care of our employees, the rest takes care of itself.  Our employees are never shy about sharing what makes SAS such a unique breath of fresh air in today’s workplace.   The investments we make in employee health, well-being and work-life balance can be seen in a dedicated workforce, committed to moving up the ranks rather than out the door. SAS’ turnover rate of about 4 percent is far below the industry average of 15 percent, which translates into consistent, long-term relationships for our SAS customers.                 SAS UK Gender Pay Gap Reporting 2017  For SAS, diversity and inclusion is more than just gender or race - we have a culture that blends our different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from our 58 countries around the world. At SAS, it's never been about fitting into the culture, it's about adding to it. We value the employee's whole self and the uniqueness of their experience, perspectives and ideas.  As such, we are wholly committed to enabling a diverse and inclusive culture, which includes gender equality, where access to rights or opportunities is unaffected by gender. Our aim is that everyone feels comfortable and confident so that they can openly express their thoughts and ideas, and know that they will be respected for their unique contributions and abilities.  Our SAS UK Gender Pay Gap Report sets out details of our gender pay gap and the steps we are taking to further close it.  Read our SAS UK Gender Pay gap report .           Culture     Benefits         Passion with a purpose  SAS believes in the whole employee experience. Meaningful work. Empowerment to make a difference that changes people’s lives. And an award-winning culture that makes it all possible. Whether you're a university recruit, or an experienced professional ready for the next big challenge, SAS will be a surprisingly good fit.       Trust from the top down   The leadership at SAS trusts our employees to get the job done. And our employees, in turn, have a high level of trust in decisions that are being made to keep SAS both stable and successful. Our management style is approachable. The lines of communication – as well as our doors – are always open.        Smart, approachable people   Direct access to the answers you need is encouraged at SAS because we believe great ideas can come from anywhere. Interns and PhDs. Millennials and baby boomers. R&D techs and marketers. All from diverse backgrounds. And all working alongside one another. Some days it’s hard to distinguish who’s learning from whom because of the collaborative atmosphere.          Growth opportunities   SAS recognises that the future of our business is based on the investment we make in our current workforce. We encourage keeping minds sharp and continually improving skill sets through mentoring and emerging leadership programs. We have a dedicated Learning and Development team who engage with employees throughout their career at SAS.       Energised environment   We’re not making widgets. We’re a knowledge company. So SAS provides an environment that fosters innovation. Lots of windows, personalized space, pops of color and original artwork offer inspiration throughout the day. And depending upon the SAS location, you could be working in a college campus atmosphere or even a castle.      Focus on fitness and fun   Fitness, recreation and fun are vital aspects of being the best we can especially at those inflection points where breaking focus for a short while can actually be beneficial to thinking out of the box, de-stressing, and helping us generate the competitive advantage. You may want to go out for a jog or long walk around the extensive SAS estate, or take a calming on-site massage, and come back relaxed and rejuvenated.          Giving back feels good   We’re passionate about education. SAS UK&I supports several initiatives promoting science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). We provide free software to teachers and students around the world, to ensure that the next generation of computer innovators have the skills to succeed. SAS also encourages our employees to volunteer for the causes they care most about.      Green is the natural choice  SAS recognises that stewardship today directly affects the preservation of natural resources tomorrow. SAS UK&I has a strong record of environmental management and responsible consumption. Whenever we can, we design our buildings in an environmentally friendly way, invest in environmentally-friendly products and biological controls to the extent we turn old cooking oil from our restaurant into fuel for the machinery used on our estate.            Our success reflects an investment in you.  SAS’ competitive Your SAS Rewards program focuses on what you care about the most - your health, your money, your career, and your life outside of work. We’re always keeping a pulse on the market and asking for employee input so we can provide programs that offer value. When it comes to amenities, the list goes on and on because we want you to be successful on every level.        Your money   SAS rewards employees by investing in them now – and by helping them prepare financially for their future. We provide a competitive salary, pension and life assurance at 4 x annual salary as well as group income protection at 50% of salary until state pension age.         Your health    SAS provides comprehensive health care benefits that exceed our competitors’. SAS UK&I provide subsidised gym memberships as well as private medical insurance for the employee with an outpatient allowance. In 2015 we launched new wellbeing initiatives focusing on physical wellbeing as well as mental / emotional wellbeing.           Your career   SAS encourages you to grow as an individual and advance your career – by providing the opportunity to continually evolve your skill sets. We make an investment in emerging leadership programs, tuition programs, technical training and business development because we recognise that your talent will be the driving force for innovation.         Your life   SAS work-life and wellness programs also help employees and their families to reduce stress and nurture positive lifestyle habits. We support and actively promote work-life balance through an array of services, including a comprehensive flexible benefits package.
