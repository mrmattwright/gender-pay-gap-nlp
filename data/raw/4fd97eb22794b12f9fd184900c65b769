Read full report               An inclusive workplace is one where everyone feels free to be who they are, supported and encouraged to fulfil their career potential.  Inclusion is deeply embedded in our culture and having a diverse workforce at all levels within the firm has long been an essential guiding principle for us.  Our aim is to ensure that all staff can bring their full selves to work and excel in their role. To help with this, we offer support via our women, parenting and LGBT networks, mentoring programmes and talks and events throughout the year on issues relating to many aspects of diversity and inclusion.  Over the last 20 years, we have been ranked highly in the tables that chart the proportion of women and LGBT employees at the firm. We are proud that, in contrast with many of our competitors, 42% of our global partnership are female and over half of our entire senior leadership team is made up of women.  We’re not complacent about the diversity of our workforce or the challenges that individuals can face in their professional and personal lives.  We treat everybody equally and we are committed to promoting and conducting an open, honest and fair culture.            Ivan Sacks - US Partner and Chairman  Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to everybody at Withers and we pride ourselves on our achievements to date and diverse representation at partnership level.  Our standards are high, our recruitment process is thorough, we want our staff to be the best in their field and we welcome people from all backgrounds. Our client base is diverse. It is an imperative that we have a diverse workforce to ensure we are effective at meeting those clients’ needs. It means we can build better relationships with them and innovate to find solutions that work better for them.               ‘‘  By living our values we continue to recruit, develop and retain a broad range of talented lawyers and support staff and commit to creating an inclusive workplace for everybody. In my role as Chairman of Withers I am proud to champion the Diversity Committee and support its work at the highest levels of our Firm and will continue to promote initiatives across all diversity strands to further equality within the sector as a whole.
