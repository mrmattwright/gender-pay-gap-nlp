Introduction

Our gender pay gap figures are not good enough. We need 
to build a more diverse and inclusive environment across 
Drax Group where colleagues are able to realise their 
potential and be supported to be at their best. 
A commitment to diversity is fundamental to achieving 
our strategic goals and delivering our purpose: helping to 
change the way energy is generated, supplied and used for 
a better future. Looking at gender pay is an important part 
of this.
Without doubt, the energy sector as a whole must do more 
to attract, engage and progress women. I am going to take 
the lead and change the way we do things at Drax Group 

to ensure we are an employer of choice for women, and 
all people, who see their future in energy. That is why I am 
making it our aim to have, by the end of 2020, 40% of roles 
in our senior leadership across Drax Group held by women.
I welcome the UK government’s new legislation requiring 
businesses with more than 250 employees to publish their 
gender pay gap year on year, supporting our commitment 
to a Drax Group culture that is transparent and supportive 
of all.

This report is for Haven Power, a retail energy company 
supplying and managing electricity for large industrial 
and commercial customers. 
The nature of our work is largely sales and service, 
working in a contact centre setting. Our mean and 
median gender pay gap is 27.4% and 30.4% respectively, 
with more men than women in senior and higher paying 
roles. We recognise we have much work to do to address 
this.
We know that diverse businesses are more successful, 
and that it is essential we recruit, retain and progress 

women and people from a diverse range of backgrounds 
in our business.
We will work with companies in our sector, local schools 
and universities and within Haven Power to ensure that 
we are providing the inspiration, encouragement, training 
and development, and support to attract, engage and 
progress women and people from diverse backgrounds 
throughout all levels of our business.

What is the gender pay gap?
The gender pay gap is the difference between 
the average earnings of men and women across 
an organisation. The gender pay gap is not the 
same as equal pay. Equal pay relates to men and 
women being paid equally for equal work.

What is the difference between mean and 
median?
The mean and median are two ways of 
calculating the average hourly pay and average 
bonus of men and women at Haven Power.  
If we created two lines, one with all the women in 
Haven Power and the other of all the men,
• the median is at exactly the half way point on 

each of the lines 

• the mean is adding up all the data separately 

for the women and the men and dividing by the 
number of people in the line.

Understanding Haven 
Power’s gender pay data

Our analysis has given us a greater understanding of the factors affecting the gender pay gap at 
Haven Power. By gaining this understanding we can put in place a plan to address the gap.

Our data for Haven Power shows that there is a 
difference of 27.4% in the mean (average) hourly 
pay of men and women and 30.4% of the median.  
This is the difference in the average pay of all 
men and women, regardless of the nature of 
their work, across all of those employed by Haven 
Power.
The mean and median bonus payment difference 
between men and women were 63% and 30% 
respectively.

What are the reasons for this?

Fewer women working in 
technology and analytical roles 
At Haven Power we specialise in 
supporting our Industrial and Commercial 
customers in the efficient use of energy 
using information technology and data 
analytics. Across the UK there are fewer 
girls and women pursuing roles requiring 
science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM subjects). Haven 
Power is competing with other companies 
for talented women to fill these roles. 

Women hold fewer senior positions 
or higher paid roles
Like many similar businesses, the single 
biggest contributing factor to the gender 
pay gap at Haven Power is that we have 
fewer women in senior positions and 
higher paid roles.
We see this as a talent gap at senior levels, 
and in some of our specialist technical 
roles, and something we can work 
positively to address.

Flexible working
Just over half the people working for 
Haven Power are women (53%). We 
provide options to all colleagues for job 
sharing, flexible working and part-time 
hours. More women (18%) than men (3%) 
work part-time; this in part contributes to 
the difference in gender bonus pay gap.

Why is the bonus gender pay gap 
different?
The lower bonus pay for women is 
because there are fewer women in senior 
and higher paid roles which attract higher 
bonus payments and more women than 
men, working part-time.

Taking action: steps to improve  
gender diversity at Haven Power

We are committed to building a more diverse and inclusive environment. 

We have set ourselves a 
clear target to increase our 
female representation in 
senior leadership across the 
Drax Group and plan to build 
a truly diverse and inclusive 
business both within Haven 
Power and across the Group.

progress on a six monthly 
basis. Currently, 28% of these

are market competitive.
