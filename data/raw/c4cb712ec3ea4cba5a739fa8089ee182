Our 2017 Gender 
Pay Gap Report

It is now a legal requirement for any organisation with over 250 employees to report their 
Gender Pay Gap and this is our report for Dorma UK Ltd. The Gender Pay Gap is the 
difference between men’s and women’s average hourly pay across an organisation,  
expressed as a percentage, that is reported as a mean average and median average. 
Although we are reporting mean and median pay gaps below the national average, we 
know there is more we could do.

Bonus Pay  

Mean 
6.42% 
16.40% 

Median
6.88%
-76.39%

Our approach to reward is gender neutral and we believe that the gap in hourly pay is 
caused by an under representation of females at senior levels within the business so we are 
committed to improving this balance and providing an equal and inclusive workplace.

We are trying to improve the male to female ratio across the organisation. However, we 
operate in what is still a male dominated sector so it will take time for us to attract female 
talent into the business. In recent years, the number of female managers within our business 
has increased via internal promotion and external selection and we feel that these role 
models are key to improving our gender diversity within the business.
