Understanding our Pay Gap:  Majestic Wine PLC employ >1,438 people across 4 countries. Women make up 31% of our total workforce.  Our mean pay gap for UK employees is -4.2%. This means average pay for women is 4.2% higher than male employees. This is significantly better than the Office of National Statistics (ONS) data which reported that women are paid, on average, 18.4% less than men in Great Britain.  Majestic Wine’s data is the opposite of the UK average primarily because we employ a larger number of men in our warehouse and delivery roles, reflecting the more manual job types. (As you can see in the “lower quartile”) Whilst our gap is significantly better the average, we recognise there is still more to do in increasing the representation of women at all levels of the business, particularly at a senior management level.  Our UK female employees also have a 4.1% higher average Bonus pay. This is as a result of senior management voluntarily waiving and deferring bonus payments as a result of weaker than anticipated trading in 2016.  3. Taking action:  Our ambition is to increase the number of women in our business, whilst continuing to pay fairly. We are committed to improving how we attract, engage and develop women as well as other under-represented groups.  Each year, Majestic Wine PLC receives fewer job applications from women than from men. This explains the fewer number of women employed by the Group. Some of the actions we are taking to improve this are outlined below:   Maternity Support. As a result of the Gender Pay Gap results the PLC Board are currently reviewing our maternity policy in order to support women at all levels of our business.  Encouraging women into the world of wine. The wine industry is one of the oldest in the world and has traditionally attracted a greater number of men. Majestic have created several new recruitment campaigns this year to encourage people to think about entering a wine related career. Recruitment training for all Store Managers and Directors now includes anti-discrimination training as part of the standard course, for the first time in Majestic’s history.  Flexible job design: The business has changed its attitude to flexible working materially over the past 12 months. There are now a number of flexible job roles at all levels of the business for both men and women.   Responsible retailing  The Group recognises that alcohol misuse, underage drinking and poor health are issues causing real concern in the UK today.  Majestic takes these matters very seriously and we are committed to the responsible retailing of alcohol in order to help mitigate their impact.  We are a supporter of Drinkaware, the government sponsored trust which promotes responsible drinking.  We operate a Challenge 25 scheme to ensure that minors cannot purchase alcohol at our stores.  In addition, we have signed up to the Government’s Responsibility Deal which aims to improve public health by encouraging responsible drinking.  We ensure that customers have access to information about alcohol in-store, on our website and in our promotional literature.  Staff training includes principles of social responsibility and alcohol misuse and all tasting events encourage customers to enjoy wine responsibly.
