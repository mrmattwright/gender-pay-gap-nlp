We are committed to being an equal opportunities employer. We seek to provide equality of opportunity and diversity, and we oppose all forms of discrimination. We believe in treating all of our employees equally and fairly, and pay people equally for the same or equivalent work regardless of their gender. We are required by law to publish an annual gender pay gap report. This is a measure of the difference between average pay for men and women across the firm. This is not a comparison of how much we pay men and women in the same or similar roles and is not a report on equal pay. This report is a snapshot as at 5 April 2017. The figures set out below have been calculated using the standard methodologies used in the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. The mean gender pay gap: 18.63% The median gender pay gap: 17.72% The mean gender bonus gap: 26.74% The median gender bonus gap: 50.00% The proportion of male employees receiving a bonus: 84.27% The proportion of female employees receiving a bonus: 62.90%  We have broken down our analysis into the four different employee groups within the firm: lawyers, paralegals, business services and directors. Lawyers Mean pay gap: 2.67% Median pay gap: 3.28% Mean bonus gap: -4.99% Median bonus gap: 22.00% Paralegals Mean pay gap: -3.62% Median pay gap: 0.00% Mean bonus gap: 10.17% Median bonus gap: 20.96% Business Services Mean pay gap: -3.97% Median pay gap: -10.31% Mean bonus gap: -17.64% Median bonus gap: 31.13% Directors Mean pay gap: 100% Median pay gap: 100% Mean bonus gap: 100% Median bonus gap: 100%  As will be apparent from the breakdown of the four employee groups, we operate a meritocracy within the firm regardless of gender. Our Lawyer results identify a marginal difference on pay in favour of males and a marginal difference on bonus in favour of females. The opposite is true when we consider our Paralegal group. The high mean bonus gap in favour of male paralegals is accounted for by the fact that many of the current female paralegals joined the firm during the financial year 2016/2017, which meant that a proportion of females were unable to achieve the full bonus that year. In addition, part time work is currently undertaken mainly by female employees (twenty females v two males). This also affects bonus payments, which are pro-rated to reflect part-time working. Mean pay and bonus gaps within our Business Services group identifies a positive difference in favour of females, which is largely reflective of the respective roles allocated within the group. As we currently only have two male directors, the mean pay and bonus gap is necessarily 100% within that category. We aim to reduce our gender pay gap and anticipate doing so over time. We are committed to equality and diversity, and we oppose all forms of discrimination. For an further information please contact Angela Melia, Head of HR, on amelia@stewartslaw.com .
