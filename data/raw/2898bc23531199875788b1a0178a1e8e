In these pages you will find links to the individual academies and information about the activities of our Collegiate as a whole, including all the essential reports and policies.  We have chosen as our patron Blessed John Henry Newman, a priest and cardinal of the Archdiocese of Birmingham in nineteenth century who was a pioneering founder of schools and writer on education.  He saw that education is not just about individual achievement, but about the full development of individuals in a community which values its rich diversity.  Our schools work together for the common good of every member, as is expressed in the guiding words, taken from the writings of Cardinal Newman: Growing together for life.

Activities across our family of schools include pupils in years 4, 5 and 6 attending masses celebrated at St Margaret Ward.  We organise a wide range of sporting and music outreach activities both within the primaries and the secondary.  Children in years 5 and 6 regularly attend lessons in preparation for year 7 and are frequent visitors as audiences for our school shows.  This extensive range of activities, together with our carefully designed transition programme, ensures smooth progress from primary to secondary education and offers children and parent's security and consistency.
