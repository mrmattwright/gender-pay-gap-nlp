Gender pay gap report

From April 2017, UK employers with 250 or more employees 
are required by law to publish their gender pay gap on an 
annual basis. This report sets out TPR’s pay gap data on 31 
March 2017, together with supporting analysis and the action 
we are taking to address the gender pay gap.

March 2018

What is a gender pay gap?
The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between men and women. If a 
workplace has a particularly high gender pay gap, this can indicate there may be a number of 
issues to address, and the individual calculations may help to identify what those issues are.

The gender pay gap is different from equal pay. Equal pay looks at whether there are any pay 
differences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal 
value. It is illegal to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.

Headline data for TPR 
The tables below show our overall median and mean gender pay and bonus gap based on hourly 
rates of pay and bonus.

Although a higher percentage of women received a bonus, the gap indicates that the men who 
received a bonus were paid higher salaries.

  As each role type carries an identical salary, it is not an issue of unequal pay

  However, a number of highly technical roles, largely filled by men, creates our gender pay gap

  For example, technical areas of the business attract a higher proportion of men (75%  
of the Technology and Change Services team is male and this area reflects 10% of the  
total organisation)

  Certain areas where salary levels are lower (eg HR, Communications, Customer Support) 

attract a higher percentage of female employees

  Under-representation of women in technical and financial roles is driven by a serious shortage 

of women with the skill requirements for these jobs. This is evidenced by the shortage of 
female applications we receive in specialist areas.

  One of the factors is proportionately very low numbers of girls and women studying STEM 

(science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects at school and university

  The number of women who then go on to pursue a career in STEM drops further: just 13% of 

employees in STEM-classed occupations are female, as per the WISE 2015 report

  Our gender pay gap of 10.8% is significantly below the UK average of 18.1%, but we continue 

to work on it, see below.

As an employer committed to diversity and inclusion we work hard to develop a fully inclusive 
workforce at all levels to help everyone reach their full potential. We have supportive people 
managers, an inclusive culture, flexible working options, and enhanced maternity and shared 
parental leave. We also offer coaching and mentoring programmes and have a Women’s Network 
to support women’s career development. However, our gender pay gap shows there’s more work 
to be done. To address our gender pay gap we will focus on:

  continuing to ensure our recruitment processes are fair and transparent 

  encouraging internships and apprenticeships in areas with a larger gender pay gap

  ensuring our entire workforce receives education around unconscious bias and other 

principles around diversity and inclusion.
