The legislation was introduced as part of the UK government’s commitment to ensure that women have the same opportunities as men to fulfil their potential in the workplace. The government’s stated aim is to completely eliminate the gender pay gap over time.  As of 4 April 2018. Abcam’s mean gender pay gap was 14.2% whilst our median gender pay gap was 11.1%. Our mean and median bonus gap was 45.6% and 12.8% respectively. We are dedicated to addressing our gender pay gap.  We are approaching this ambition boldly with the introduction of new programmes, complementing existing initiatives that have shown promise to date.  Listed below are the seven commitments we have made to help us address our gender pay gap:   We will agree and introduce targets for female representation in senior leadership roles;  We will ensure that there is at least 1 woman on every senior shortlist;  We will conduct a survey of colleagues who have taken maternity/paternity leave to understand what went well and what could be better. From this action recommendations on how we can better support returners through a return to work programme will be made;  We will review the terms of our maternity and paternity policies;  We will Introduce unconscious bias training for line managers involved in recruitment and promotion decisions;  We will review the terms of our part time and flexible working policies; and  We will introduce development networks for women and for families.   We believe that taking the actions as described above will stimulate meaningful and necessary change.  Please click here to access Abcam’s 2018 Gender Pay Gap Report.
