The Gender Pay Gap looks at the difference in the average pay of men and women in an organisation.  This is different from Equal Pay which is where men and women are paid the same pay for the same work.  At Genesis, as at April 2017, the average difference in pay was 19.81% between men and women, which means the average salary for men is 19.81% higher than the average salary for women.       Why is that?  Simply because we work in lots of different markets, e.g. Care and Support and Assets and Investments, where what we are able to pay is very different.  We have more women than men in front-line  roles, for example in Care and Support, where salaries are often lower. In many cases within Care and Support, what we are able to pay is set by external market factors, such as the contract price set by commissioners.  Due to the nature of the services, Care and Support has a much higher proportion of women in front line roles, with many of our schemes outside London, compared to manager and specialist roles in the rest of the business.  Looking at the Gender Pay Gap in just Care and Support, the figure reduces to -8.01% (which means that the average salary for women is higher than the average salary for  men – Similarly, if you look at the rest of the business (without Care and Support) the Gender Pay Gap figure is a lot lower at 6.09%.        Does this mean there is no Equal Pay in Genesis?  On the contrary; the 19.81% difference is reflective of how women and men are spread throughout the organisation. It does not indicate that men and women doing the same work are paid differently – it reflects how a bigger proportion of women are in lower paid roles.  For Genesis we have a fair approach to reward. Following the Gender pay gap analysis, we have gone a step further and analysed our salary data to ensure there are no issues with Equal Pay.        What is the approach to Reward at Genesis?  During 2017 we adopted a new approach to how we reward our staff; by focussing on reviewing the roles not the people in those roles.  We achieve clarity and transparency through assessing the ‘size’ of each role in comparison to others in the business, and setting the level of pay in accordance with external benchmarking.  We will benchmark every three years across the markets that we operate in and against a wide range of different organisations.        What does the mean/ median/ quartiles mean that we have to report?  Genesis is required to publish the difference in ‘mean’, ‘median’ and quartiles as this is a good indication of how salaries of men and women are spread throughout an organisation.  They mean:   Mean: this is calculated by adding all the men’s salaries and dividing by the number of men in the organisation.  Then adding all the women’s salaries and dividing by the number of women.  The mean Gender Pay Gap is the difference between these two numbers. Our mean gender pay gap is: 19.81%    Median: this is calculated by sorting all the men’s salaries by size and selecting the middle salary.  Then sorting all the women’s salaries by size and selecting the middle salary.  The median Gender Pay Gap is the difference between these two figures. Our median gender pay gap is: 28.55%    Quartiles: This is where all the salaries – men and women – are sorted by size and divided into equal quarters.  Genesis has to publish the percentage of men and women in each quarter; this shows how men and women are spread throughout the organisation by salary brackets.     Upper Quartile – the highest paid 25% - 50% female and 50% male  Upper Middle Quartile – the next 25% - 62% female and 38% male  Lower Middle Quartile – the next 25% - 74% female and 26% male  Lower Quartile – the lowest paid 25% - 70% female and 30% male         What is our workforce split?  As of April 2017, our workforce comprised 64% females and 36% males.        What is the plan for addressing Gender Pay Gaps in the future?  Genesis is committed to both Equal Pay and closing the Gender Pay Gap that exists in our workforce:  We are committed to undertaking an Equal Pay audit. This follows on from the organisation-wide introduction of our new approach to reward.  We want to make sure that people are paid a fair wage, regardless of who they are and where they work in the business.  We are also reviewing our recruitment and selection criteria and changing where we advertise so that we can attract more women to more senior positions.  Similarly, we want to recruit more male Care and Support workers to enhance service provision in this area and offer genuine choice to customers of these services. We are working on a wider diversity and inclusion programme that seeks to make what is traditionally seen as 'women's work' more attractive to men.         Are you still reviewing Equal Pay?  Yes, our approach to reward as well as the steps mentioned above in addressing the gap will look at all areas of reward including Equal Pay. We have recently analysed our salary data and we have found no issues with Equal Pay. When we complete our role sizing we will be able to do a full Equal Pay Audit.
