Our data, which has been published on the government’s website , shows that:   79% of our workforce are women  75% of the top quartile of earners are women  The average hourly pay for women is 1.8% lower than for men  The median hourly pay for women is 2.2% lower than for men   The gender pay gap is not about equal pay for men and women. It is the difference between the average and median pay of men and women. It does not measure equal pay, which relates to what women and men are paid for the same jobs or work of equal value. In Achieving for Children equal pay is addressed through our job evaluation scheme.  The data required by government is a fairly simplistic indicator of a complex set of issues. Our ambition is to ensure equality of opportunity for women. We will seek to achieve this by:   Refining and developing our attraction and recruitment processes  Championing our talent and leadership programmes  Reviewing and developing our learning and development offer  Growing and promoting our mentoring and coaching offer  Supporting women to remain in work through our flexible working arrangements                About Us About us  Our mission and promises  Leadership   Senior Leadership Team  Senior leadership structure  Board of Directors    Key documents   Introduction  Equality and diversity documents    Freedom of Information   Introduction  Disclosure Log  Publication Scheme   Introduction  Who we are and how we work   Gender pay gap    What we spend  Our policies and procedures  Our priorities and performance  How we make decisions  How are we doing?
