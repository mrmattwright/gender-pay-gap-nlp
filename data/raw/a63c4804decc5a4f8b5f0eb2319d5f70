Statutory Duty  Under the Equality Act 2010, we have a duty ( Public Sector Equality Duty ) to consider how our policies and decisions impact people who have protected characteristics under the Act. To meet this we are required to: publish information annually to show compliance with the Equality Duty and set and publish equality objectives every four years.  When publishing the above information we must show how we are working within the three aims of the Equality Duty to:  •   eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation  •   advance equality of opportunity between different groups who share a protected characteristic  •   foster good relations between different groups of protected characteristics  Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Objectives  Over the next four years we will work towards achieving our equality, diversity and inclusion objectives which are based on five key themes  Full details of equality objectives are set out in our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy ( page 6 ).
