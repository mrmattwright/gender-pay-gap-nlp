We take these commitments seriously.  Under UK law (effective from April 2017), employers with more than 250 employees are required to publish certain data about gender pay. Our data is set out in this report.  The gender pay gap relates to differences in average male and female pay within an employer. It does not compare the pay received by men and women for doing the same work or work of equal value (known as equal pay).  Assessing our gender pay data indicates that the difference in average pay is due to proportionately more men being in senior, higher paid roles. At April 2017, our total female workforce in the UK stood at approximately 20%. Like many organisations in our industry and sector we would like this figure to be much higher.  We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business. Sealed Air promotes equality in reward packages for men and women doing the same or similar job. To assist with this we operate a banding system for all positions which ensures consistency of salaries benefits and bonuses being equal within the bands.  Pay Information  Difference in mean hourly rate of pay between male and female employees: 18.6% Difference in median hourly rate of pay between male and female employees 34.4%  Hourly Rate Quartiles  Gender | Lower | Lower Middle | Upper Middle | Upper  Male | 72.1% | 72.4% | 92.4% | 87.6%  Female | 27.9% | 27.6% | 7.6% | 12.4%  Bonus Information  Difference in mean bonus pay between male and female employees 66.8% Difference in median bonus pay between male and female employees 60.6%  Percentage of male employees who received bonus pay 44.7% Percentage of female employees who received bonus pay 76.7%  I confirm the data reported is accurate and in line with Government reporting regulations.
