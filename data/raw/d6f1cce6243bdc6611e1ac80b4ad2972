Introduction 
 
All companies with 250 or more employees are now required to publish their gender pay gap under 
new legislation that came into force in April 2017.  Employers have to publish the gap in pay between 
men and women on both a median basis (pay per hour based on the person ‘in the middle’ of the 
distribution of pay) and a mean basis (average hourly salary).  In addition, employers are required to 
disclose the distribution of gender by pay quartile – in other words splitting the workforce into four 
groups based on their pay, and showing the proportion of men and women in each group.  Employers 
are also required to disclose percentages of staff receiving bonuses by gender and the gender gap on 
bonuses.   
 
The Shaw Education Trust as an employer is required by law to carry out Gender Pay Reporting 
under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017.
