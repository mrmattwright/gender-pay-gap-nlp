The EDS not only covers people from Protected Characteristics Groups but also other people who may suffer stigma, such as homeless people.

The move follows recent reports which have highlighted disparities in the number of BME people in senior leadership positions across the NHS, as well as lower levels of wellbeing amongst the BME population.  At Somerset Partnership we have set out our plans and published our Workforce Race Equality Standard progress here:   Workforce Race Equality Standard 2016 - 17  Workforce Race Equality Standard 2015 - 16  Our Partnership   Gender Pay Gap  This report provides the Trust’s first Gender Pay Gap (GPG) information based on data for the period including the first snapshot date of 31 March 2017.  It is published in line with the requirements set out in the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017.
