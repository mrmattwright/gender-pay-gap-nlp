What does Gender Pay Gap 
Reporting include?
From 2017 onwards, any UK 
employer with over 250 employees 
must report their gender pay gap. 
The gender pay gap shows the 
difference in the average earnings 
between men and women within the 
organisation. 

The regulations include the following 
requirements:
1.  The average difference 

between salary and bonus 
for males and females 
(mean and median) over a 
12-month period. This report 
covers the 12 months up to 5 
April 2017.

2.  The proportion of males and 
females receiving bonus pay

3.  The proportion of males to 

females by quartile bands of 
pay level

the number of men and women 
who received a bonus for their 
performance in 2016. Reviewing
