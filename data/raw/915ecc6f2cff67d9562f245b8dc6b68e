Living in a retirement village is all about choosing the lifestyle that suits you – without the maintenance of a large family home to worry about; or keeping on top of the garden.  It’s about morning coffee in the exclusive residents’ clubhouse with friends and neighbours; enjoying lunch in the restaurant; joining a special interest group; attending regular social functions or it could be simply appreciating the peace and quiet in the privacy of your own home in a beautifully landscaped setting.  Retirement Villages currently operates across 14 locations with two further villages opening soon and another five in the planning pipeline. We provide private independent living one, two and three bedroom apartments, cottages and bungalows.             Featured Village  Our beautiful retirement village in Dunchurch, Lime Tree Village has a range of brand new properties available in The Polo Field.           Attend our next event  Our open days could be the perfect opportunity for you and your family to see what life is like in one of our retirement villages.               About Retirement Villages      Care Options Available    FAQ    Case Studies    Our Blog    Contact Us        About Retirement Villages  Retirement Villages has been providing age-exclusive retirement lifestyles at stunning locations across the UK for 35 years. Residents are able to live independently in their own home but enjoy the hospitality and warmth that comes from the communal clubhouse facilities – the social heartbeat of our villages.  Each has its own identity – you would expect nothing less – but most have restaurants, bars, libraries, conservatories and lounges where residents can enjoy each other’s company. Some have swimming pools, hairdressers and exercise areas. Others have tennis courts, bowls or putting greens. All have landscaped grounds delivering a peaceful haven in which to lead a fulfilling retirement lifestyle.    Life at our villages  We always maintain that while we design and build our villages, it is the residents who bring them to life. A Retirement Villages lifestyle allows you to do what you want, when you want. Many of the chores associated with property ownership are taken care of – leaving you free to lead as fulfilling a retirement lifestyle as possible.  All villages enjoy a vibrant and active social life – with a broad range of special interest clubs and societies run by residents, for residents. There is a real sense of community. Behind it all is an inner peace of mind – knowing that should you require any assistance or support, it can be made available.
