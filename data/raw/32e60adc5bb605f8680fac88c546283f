There is only one legal entity accountable for all schools within the Multi-Academy Trust (MAT).  The MAT has one set of Articles which governs all academies within the MAT.   Members Academy trusts do not have shareholders; they have members. The role and rights of members is analogous to that of shareholders. They hold the AGM and appoint Directors.  The Members are:  Georgina Glover Quentin Roper Wayne Barry Angela Barry  Directors  Work with the leadership team to set the strategic vision and ethos of the Trust.  Most members of the LAB will  not be directors of the MAT and will mainly be representatives from the school. They have duties delegated to them by the board of directors. It is the responsibility of the board to ensure that they are exercising these functions in line with the relevant duties. The LABs advise and make recommendations to the board through regular meeting with the board’s chair and via minutes of LAB meetings.
