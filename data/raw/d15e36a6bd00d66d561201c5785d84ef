Gender Pay Gap 
Report 2017

Foreword

At Vodafone, our ambition is to become 
an employer whose track record in 
attracting and retaining female talent 
is so strong that by 2025 we will be 
considered the world’s best employer 
for women. We seek to be a company 
whose global workforce reflects the 
customers we serve and the broader 
societies within which we operate by 
aiming for gender parity throughout 
the organisation. We believe our strong 
commitment to diversity is a source 
of business strength, enabling us to 
understand better the needs of the men 
and women, families and businesses 
who rely on our networks and services. 
Vodafone’s commitment to gender equality is 
led directly by our Group Chief Executive, 
Vittorio Colao, one of 10 business leaders who 
act as champions for the UN Women HeForShe 
solidarity movement for gender equality. We are 
also a member of the 30% Club and as at 
February 2018, 33% of Vodafone Group Plc 
Board members were women.

It is important to explain prior to reading this 
report the distinction between equal pay and 
the gender pay gap. Equal pay means paying a 
man and a woman the same amount for work 
that is the same or broadly similar. Since the 
1970s, companies have been required by law 
to pay men the same as women (and vice 

versa) for ‘work of equal value’. The gender 
pay gap is the difference between the hourly 
pay of women versus men, calculated as an 
average across the workforce as a whole. As 
senior roles pay more than junior roles, the 
fewer the number of women who hold senior 
roles in a company, the greater is the average 
gender pay gap.

Therefore, the gender pay gap is a measure  
of the extent to which women are able to 
participate in senior management and 
leadership roles in an organisation. 

In the UK, 34% of our workforce are women 
and 30% of our management and leadership 
roles are held by women. The goal for our 
Vodafone UK operating company1, which 
provides products and services to over  
17.6 million mobile customers in the UK, is to 
reach 35% representation of women in 
management and leadership roles by 2020.

Globally, our goal is to increase the 
representation of women in management and 
leadership roles to 30% by 2020 (up from 28% 
as at 31 March 2017), with a view to further 
increasing that proportion over time. 

We operate with clear targets on gender 
balance, supported by a number of 
programmes that are implemented across  
all of our businesses worldwide. 

We strongly welcome public focus on the 
need for a significant increase in women’s 
participation in, and leadership of, the 

organisations (both commercial and  
public sector) that are central to daily life, 
driven by this reporting requirement and  
other initiatives. 

Increased recruitment of women into 
management and leadership roles and 
increased retention of senior female leaders 
are critical priorities for Vodafone. In this 
report, we summarise a number of innovative 
programmes – including our ground-breaking 
global maternity policy and the world’s largest 
international programme to recruit women after 
a career break – that are designed to enhance 
our overall gender balance. Through these and 
other programmes, we are determined to play  
a meaningful role in supporting the 
empowerment of women worldwide.

Vodafone Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Foreword   |   Introduction   |   Vodafone’s gender pay gap   |   Working towards equality   |   Appendix

Introduction

This is Vodafone’s first Gender Pay Gap 
statutory report for our UK employees, 
prepared as required under the  
Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017 that 
came into effect in April 2017. 
We welcome the UK Government’s legislation 
requiring companies with more than 250 
employees in the UK to reveal the percentage 
of female employees working in a business 
and the difference in average pay between 
women and men. Scrutiny of this kind is a 
positive step forward and should act as a 
catalyst to ensure greater female participation 
in management and leadership roles.

Equality of opportunity between men and 
women is a key indicator of long-term social 
stability and economic prosperity. The 
need for gender equality in the workplace 
has been recognised as a critical issue for 
decades. However, women still remain under-
represented within many companies, and 
strikingly so at the most senior levels; women 
only occupy 14% of senior executive positions 
in the 600 largest companies in Europe2.  
A recent World Economic Forum study 
estimates that at current rates of progress, 
women will not reach parity with men – in 
terms of average pay and employment 
opportunities – for another 217 years3.

The challenge of workplace gender equality 
begins when a young woman first leaves school 
or university and takes the first step in her 
career. In the UK – the country where Vodafone 
is domiciled and where the legislation that is the 

focus of this report has been enacted – young 
women and men enter the workplace in broadly 
equal numbers and with broadly equivalent skills. 

Equality of 
opportunity is a key 
indicator of long-term 
social stability and 
economic prosperity

However, one year after leaving university, men 
are already earning on average 8% more than 
their female peers as a consequence of study 
and career choices4. For example, many more 
young men than women currently study science, 
technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) 
subjects at school or university and then enter 
sectors such as financial services or technology 
where remuneration is significantly higher than 
the national average. 

Five years after graduation, the average gender 
pay gap widens to 14% as more men than 
women enter middle management for the first 
time5. Furthermore, women are more likely to 
work in industries with lower average rates of pay 
and are more likely to move into part-time roles 
as a consequence of the demands of childcare 
and, increasingly, care for elderly parents. As 
those demands grow – often at the point when 
a woman’s career approaches middle or senior 

management level – a high proportion feel 
they have no choice but to leave the workforce 
altogether for a number of years, in many 
instances never to return.

As a result, management and senior leadership 
roles remain dominated by men, and the global 
average for women’s earnings is around half 
that for men6.

Vodafone is one of the world’s largest 
communications companies. We build and 
operate mobile and fixed-line networks 
relied upon by more than 529 million mobile 
customers in 26 countries and 19 million fixed 
broadband customers in 19 countries. 

Our local UK operating company, Vodafone UK, 
has more than 17.6 million mobile customers as 
of 31 December 2017. It directly employs around 
12,500 people and has a retail presence on most 
UK high streets. Vodafone Group (our corporate 
function that provides strategic support to our 
local operating companies) is domiciled in the 
UK, and Vodafone Global Enterprise (VGEL), our 
dedicated global Enterprise business (which 
serves multinational corporate customers) is 
also based in the UK. In total, we employ more 
than 17,000 people in the UK. 

Just over one-third (34%) of our UK employees 
are women. We have female colleagues in all 
professional functions, from Engineering, IT, 
Technology and Security to Customer Operations, 
Marketing, HR, Retail, Communications and Legal. 
Around half of our UK-based female employees 
work in our retail and customer operations, and 
within each function the highest proportion of 
women are found in HR, Corporate and External 
Affairs and Legal.

Our commitment to women’s empowerment 
is led from the very top of the organisation. 
Vodafone’s diversity and gender equality 
programmes are overseen by the Vodafone 
Group Plc Board, and our Group Chief Executive 
personally champions this issue both within 
the company and as an external advocate. Our 
mandatory Code of Conduct makes it clear 
that respect for diversity is integral to the 
behaviours expected from everyone who works 
for Vodafone. We do not tolerate prejudice 
in any form, and strive to ensure that every 
colleague has the opportunity to thrive in a 
workplace that is welcoming and supportive.

We have also identified women’s 
empowerment as one of three major global 
transformation goals under the Vodafone 
Group Sustainable Business Framework. 
Further details of our ambitions in this area are 
set out in our Sustainable Business Report.

UK legislation now requires all organisations 
that are domiciled in the UK and that employ 
more than 250 people to publish specific 
metrics related to the gender pay gap annually 
by 4 April. 

The metrics stipulated under the Act are 
the average pay gap and average bonus gap 
together with the proportion of men and 
women receiving bonuses and a summary of 
the organisation’s pay structure segmented 
by gender. The regulations specifically require 
both the median and mean gender pay gap to 
be reported; these metrics are complementary 
and illustrate different aspects of the 
distribution of pay across an organisation. 

The mean is calculated by adding up all 
average hourly salaries and dividing them by 
the number of employees. The resulting gap 
is the percentage difference between the 
average male and female hourly pay figures. 
The methodology for determining the median 
gender pay gap requires companies to identify 
the hourly pay for the middle (or median) male 
and female employee, when ranked from the 
lowest to the highest. The resulting gap is the 
percentage difference between the midpoints 
in the male and female hourly pay. 

The information we present in this report has 
been prepared on this basis, and selected 
aspects of this information has undergone 
independent limited assurance by KPMG. 
Further details of the scope, procedures and 
conclusion reached are set out in the Appendix 
on page 12. 

The information presented captures our 
UK-based employees and is derived from 
employees who work for our UK local 
operating company and our Vodafone Group 
functions based in the UK. Employees from the 
following entities are therefore included in our 
gender pay reporting:

•  Vodafone UK7 – our UK operating business 
supporting our 17.6 million UK consumers 
and business customers. The majority 
of Vodafone UK employees work in 
Customer Operations, Retail and Network 
Support, together with colleagues in Sales, 
Technology, Account and Programme 
Management roles;

•  Vodafone Global Enterprise Limited 
(VGEL) – supporting our multinational 
enterprise customers;

•  Vodafone Group Services Limited  
(VGSL) including Vodafone Group  
Plc – supporting our local operating 
companies  – and predominantly based  
in our international headquarters in  
London; and

•  Vodafone Sales and Services Limited 

(VSSL) – supporting the commercial, 
marketing and brand functions, 
predominantly based in our international 
headquarters in London.

Data for each of these entities can be found in 
the Appendix on page 13.

Vodafone’s gender pay gap

We employ more than 17,000 people in the 
UK. Despite considerable efforts (as explained 
elsewhere in this report) to recruit and retain an 
equal number of males and females, there are 
nearly twice as many men as women working 
for us in total in the UK, at 66% (11,304).

Our mean gender pay gap, at 16.9%, is slightly 
below the UK national average: the Office of 
National Statistics (ONS) mean gender pay gap 
2017 is 17.4%. Our median pay gap, at 24.3%, is 
above the ONS national average of 18.4%. 

The mean gender pay gap for Vodafone 
shows that the average hourly pay for all male 
employees is 16.9% higher than the average 
hourly pay for all female employees. 

At Vodafone the female median hourly pay is 
for an employee who holds a graduate role; 
in contrast, the male median hourly pay is for 
an employee who holds a more senior role 
with more than five years’ experience. It is this 
difference in roles, and the pay associated with 
those roles, that drives our median gender pay 
gap of 24.3%.

The gender pay gap at Vodafone – as at many 
other companies – is a consequence of the 
fact that more men occupy more senior and 
therefore more highly paid roles at Vodafone 
(73.9%). Women, who make up 34% of our total 
UK workforce, only occupy 26.1% of the roles 
in the upper pay quartile but hold a higher 
proportion of roles in the lower pay quartile 
(43.9%). As a result, average male earnings 
(both mean and median) are higher than 
average female earnings as there are more men 
in senior roles in our dataset than women.

Similarly, as the average bonus for a more 
senior employee is much higher than the 
average bonus for more junior employees – and 
there are significantly more men than women 
who hold the most senior roles – the bonus 
gap (at 22.4% for the median and 41.5% for the 
mean) is a consequence of fewer women than 
men in senior roles. 

Vodafone’s gender pay gap is a 
result of more men occupying 
more senior and therefore 
more highly paid roles

Working towards equality
Our core programmes
Global maternity policy
We know that women who feel supported by 
their employer through their maternity leave 
and after their return to work are more likely to 
remain with the company over the longer term. 
Higher retention of colleagues who are working 
mothers offers clear business benefits in terms 
of continuity of skills and experience, as well as 
avoidance of recruitment and induction costs  
to replace leavers.

Maternity returner
Liz Cass is a Senior Product Manager 
for Vodafone UK with responsibility for 
managing strategic programmes across our 
Commercial Business Unit. Liz wanted to 
return to her role after maternity leave and 
was looking for additional flexibility to help 
balance her work and family commitments. 

This scheme offered Liz – who had worked 
for Vodafone for seven years – a smooth 
transition back into the workplace after 
her maternity leave, while enabling her to 
spend Fridays at home with her family.

“The opportunity to have greater flexibility 
around my working days and hours made a 
meaningful difference to my return  
to work.” 

In April 2015, Vodafone became one of the first 
companies in the world to offer a global minimum 
maternity policy to all employees and in every 
country in which we operate. Any woman working 
for Vodafone is offered a minimum of 16 weeks’ 
fully paid maternity leave as well as a phased 
return to work, including a 30-hour week on full 
pay for the first six months after their return.

It is important to note that these are global 
minimum benchmarks – not an upper limit – 
which are of greatest relevance in countries with 
little or no statutory maternity rights. We continue 
to abide by (and often exceed) statutory 
requirements in countries where these exist. In 
2017, more than 1,700 female employees went on 
maternity leave (517 in the UK), all of whom were 
eligible to benefit from this ground-breaking 
policy. In 2015, Vodafone received the Company 
of the Year Award at the European Diversity 
Awards in recognition of our policy and other 
initiatives. Other multinational companies are 
now following our lead with similar programmes.

ReConnect
Worldwide, there are an estimated 55 million 
skilled women at middle-management level or 
above who are not in work following a career 
break8. Those women represent a very large 
potential pool of talent, insight and experience, 
and if they returned to the workplace they 
could have a significant impact on overall 
gender balance.

In reality, it is not that simple. Getting back into 
work after an extended career break can be 
difficult; research undertaken by KPMG in 2016 
indicated that 80% of women who have taken a 
career break said more support was needed to 
help them return successfully to the workplace9. 

In March 2017, Vodafone launched ReConnect, 
the largest international programme of its kind 
designed to bring talented women back into 
the workplace after a career break. Support for 
those returning to work includes training, 
coaching and induction programmes to refresh 
and enhance professional skills. ReConnect 
returners are also offered flexible working 
options and a phased return to work, such as a 
four-day week for the first six months. 

Our global target is to hire 1,000 ReConnect 
women over three years in functions such 
as Technology, Commercial, HR, Finance, 
Legal, External Affairs, Customer Operations 
and Business Intelligence & Analytics. 
This will increase the number of women 
in management roles, with around 10% of 

all Vodafone external management hires 
recruited through the programme over  
the next three years; in the UK in 2017, we 
offered roles to 30 returners. We promote 
ReConnect at career fairs, and in November 
2017 we hosted a ReConnect event with  
10 of our suppliers and enterprise customers. 
We have also encouraged and supported one 
of our suppliers to establish their own similar 
returners’ programme. 

“We are committed to ensuring 
that our employees are drawn 
from diverse communities and 
societies. Our ambition, to be 
considered as the best employer 
for women in the world, is central 
to that commitment. Companies 
often struggle to recruit and 
retain women in management 
and leadership roles. Innovations 
such as our global maternity 
policy and our ReConnect 
programme can make a real 
difference to women who work 
for us today and who will work for 
us in the future.” 

Vittorio Colao, Group Chief Executive

Reconnecting to work
Petra Cattanach is a senior manager 
working for Vodafone Group Technology 
in Cloud Business Operations. Prior to her 
career break to raise her young family, 
she had 10 years’ business experience in 
software development. 

In 2017, she decided she wanted to return 
to work full time. Petra was looking for a 
company that championed women in the 
workplace and offered flexible working 
arrangements. She found the flexibility 
ReConnect offered would enable her to 
return to a full-time role.

“I decided to take time out to have my 
second child because I knew I would not  
get the chance again. When the time was 
right, ReConnect supported my return to 
the workplace.”

Supporting women early in  
their careers
Vodafone is an attractive employer of choice 
for recent female graduates. In 2017, women 
accounted for more than 55% of the intake 
into our Discover graduate development 
programme and 52% of the intake into our 
Columbus leadership fast-track graduate 
scheme. We are expanding the number 
of vocational training and apprenticeship 
opportunities across all of the countries in 
which we operate and ensure that these  
and our work experience placements are 
gender-balanced. 

Men and women are 
equally represented 
in our graduate 
programmes

There is a vast amount of research that 
demonstrates that women are less likely to 
study STEM subjects at all levels of education 
globally. With jobs in STEM subjects often 
paying higher salaries, these choices, made 
early on, are a key contributor to the gender 
pay gap. To help influence girls’ further 
education and career choices, Vodafone runs 
mentoring and work experience programmes 
designed to encourage female students to 
think about STEM-related options. 

In the UK, women account for just 23% of the 
workforce in STEM-related sectors10. Vodafone 
UK is collaborating with BT, O2, Ericsson and 
the NGO Girls Talk London to run a mentoring 
and work experience initiative in low-income 
areas of London, focused on young women. 
During the seven-month programme, female 
students are assigned a mentor to help them 
as they think about their future educational 
and career options, understand the skills 
needed to fulfil them, undertake a week’s work 
experience and gain support developing their 
CVs and further education applications.

Embedding our commitment to 
diversity in our culture 
Conscious or unconscious bias among hiring 
managers can severely limit a woman’s ability 
to progress within an organisation (and can 
also adversely affect attempts to increase 
other forms of institutional diversity). In 2016, 
Vodafone launched a new unconscious bias 
and diversity training programme designed to 
raise hiring managers’ awareness of how small 
(and typically unintended) actions or cultural 
and behavioural norms can hamper progress 
towards an inclusive workplace. In addition, 
induction programmes for senior leaders 
across Vodafone emphasise the importance of 
gender balance, diversity and inclusion, and 
we have introduced new training programmes 
focused on the recruitment process and on the 
skills required to manage diverse teams.

We have developed and implemented 
recruitment processes aimed at ensuring 
women have equal access to all opportunities 
on offer. We also seek to ensure that candidate 
lists for senior management roles include 

a balance of male and female applicants 
and that at least one female applicant 
is put forward to the final stage of the 
interview process.

One of the reasons why working mothers 
take on most of the childcare is the historical 
reluctance of many employers to extend 
maternal flexible working arrangements to 
include fathers. We have introduced a new 
shared parental leave policy to try to address 
this imbalance and give women greater  
scope to focus on their careers. Working 
parents among our UK-based workforce can 
share up to 37 weeks’ paid parental leave. In 
the UK, fathers who have taken shared leave 
do so for an average of 57 days each,  
allowing them to play an active role in their 
children’s development. Fathers may also 
be entitled to up to four weeks’ additional 
paternity leave per year (one week paid), 
supporting families during transition periods or 
school holidays.

Vodafone has taken a proactive approach to 
enable working parents to remain engaged in 
the workplace and continue to progress their 
careers. More than 3,000 (17%) of our UK-
based employees utilise some form of flexible 
working or work on a part-time basis; of that 
number, around 40% are women. Vodafone 
has implemented policies designed to support 
our employees with part-time working 
arrangements – including reduced hours and 
job-share arrangements – in order to balance 
home life with their careers.

Leading diversity in our Enterprise business 

26% of our global  
senior leadership  
team are women

We now have active women’s networks 
operating in most of the countries in which we 
operate. These networks have been founded 
by employees and are managed by them.  
They offer women at all levels a supportive 
and informative environment in which to 
network, share and learn. As an example, 
our Women in Technology Network now has 
more than 1,600 members and more than 
80 local market and professional function 
representatives. It hosts global webinars 
every quarter as well as face-to-face meetings 
locally. The Vodafone UK women’s network 
has more than 1,000 members and meets at 
least once every quarter.

Kerry Phillip is Legal Director for Group 
Enterprise, our business supporting 
multinational customers. Kerry has  
worked at Vodafone since 2010, when  
she joined as Head of Legal for Vodafone’s 
UK operating company. 

Last year, after attending an unconscious 
bias training session, she and a colleague 
decided they wanted to do more to  
attract, empower and support women 
 to progress their careers within  
Enterprise and established a Women  
in Enterprise community. 

The community offers a range of informal 
events and activities, including a chat  
show that Kerry hosts and is broadcast 
monthly, local networking events and an 
online network. It now has more than  
800 members across 16 countries, and  
up to 500 people watching the monthly 
shows. Kerry has also encouraged other 
leaders from around the business to 
promote gender diversity.

Kerry runs a gender diverse team and 
currently 62% of her managers are female. 
In 2014, Kerry was included in the Power 
Part-Time Top 50 List published by the 
Financial Times, which profiles the top 50 
most powerful people in the UK who have 
adopted a flexible approach to working. 

“I believe that providing flexible working 
allows us to attract and retain talented 
employees who place enormous value on 
the key balance between work and home 
life. Our technology helps make this possible 
for many roles.”

Monitoring our progress on diversity 
Progress on our diversity goals – including 
data on recruitment, performance 
management and promotion – is overseen 
by our Group Chief Executive and the Group 
Executive Committee (Exco). The percentage 
of women in Vodafone’s global senior 
leadership team (SLT) – our top 175–225 
employees – has increased from 17% in 2011 
to 26% in 2017, and in our senior management 
community it has increased from 21% in 2011 
to 25% in 2017. In 2011, women accounted for 
13% of the Vodafone Group Plc Board, which 
increased to 30% in 2017 and as at February 
2018 is 33%. Our Exco has increased slightly to 
14%, up from 10% in 2011. We intend to take 
further action wherever these percentages fall 
short of our target of 30% of all management 
and leadership roles to be held by women by  
2020 worldwide.

Every quarter we conduct an analysis of 
progress, led by our Group HR Director, in order 
to identify any challenges and adapt what we 
do (or devise new approaches) to remedy any 

shortcomings. Vodafone’s overall progress  
on gender balance is reviewed twice a year 
by our Group Exco – led by the Group Chief 
Executive – with updates presented to the 
Vodafone Group Plc Board. 

33% of the Vodafone 
Group Plc Board 
members are women11

In our annual confidential employee survey, 
the people who work for Vodafone consistently 
demonstrate support for, and belief in, 
Vodafone’s commitment to equality. In the 
2017 survey (which was completed by 88% of 
all employees worldwide), 81% of respondents 
said they felt they had an equal opportunity to 
succeed, irrespective of age, gender, disability, 
sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural 
background or beliefs. 

Percentage of women in leadership and senior management roles

The Hampton-Alexander Review 

The Hampton-Alexander Review, led 
by Sir Philip Hampton and the late 
Dame Helen Alexander, focuses on the 
percentage of women on Boards, on 
Executive Committees (Exco) and in 
direct report to the Exco, within UK  
public companies. 

In 2016, the review recommended that all 
companies in the FTSE 100 should have 
at least 33% female representation at 
Board level and 33% women in leadership 
teams by 2020; a target that has now 
been extended to the FTSE 250 for 
2017. Each review also includes ranked 
assessments of UK public companies’ 
progress towards those targets. 

In 2017, Vodafone was ranked 18th 
in the FTSE 100 – the highest ranked 
telecommunications company – with 
36.4% female representation at Board 
level and 22.5% at Exco and direct  
reports to the Exco. We were ranked  
49th in the FTSE 350.

Celebrating women’s achievements 
We want to raise the profile of female role 
models and celebrate women’s achievements 
with visible support from our senior leaders. 
Our global webinar on International Women’s 
Day in March 2017 was led by our Group Chief 
Executive and was watched live by more 
than 2,500 employees worldwide, including 
20 local market chief executives and their 
senior leadership teams. The webinar was 
one of a series of more than 30 International 
Women’s Day events worldwide (including 
roundtable discussions, networking events, 
and role-modelling and mentoring sessions 
and training) that took place over one week, 
with communications reaching more than 
50,000 employees. 

In 2017, Vodafone was named one of The Times 
Top 50 Employers for Women by Business in 
the Community, and our Group Chief Executive 
was named top Male Champion of Women in 
Business by the Financial Times and HERoes. 
In November 2017, Kerry Small, Head of 
Enterprise Customer Operations, was named 
Female Executive of the Year at the Stevie 
Awards for Women in Business, and Clare Hillis, 
Client Sales Manager, Vodafone UK, was  
named Best Technology Sales Woman at the 
Women in Sales Awards.

Appendix
Statutory disclosure  
and methodology
In this section, we provide further detail 
on our response to the UK’s statutory 
requirement to publish Vodafone’s 
gender pay gap data. 
We provide an overview of the scope of 
this report, and we describe the five legal 
entities covered within it. We provide the 
datasets for all relevant entities, along with 
the consolidated figures that present the 
total position for our employees who work for 
Vodafone in the UK. 

This section also includes KPMG’s limited 
assurance statement on page 14.

How we report on the UK  
gender pay gap 
Below, we outline the basis of preparation 
for the Vodafone gender pay gap figures 
contained within this report. We follow the 
methodology set out in the Equality Act 2010 
(Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 
2017 (‘the legislation’) and ACAS Managing 
Gender Pay Gap Reporting Guide 2017 (‘the 
ACAS Guide’) and publish further information 
on reporting definitions to explain the basis 
upon which this disclosure has been prepared.

Scope
This report is based on a combined set of 
figures from five Vodafone legal entities.

Our UK local operating company:
•  Vodafone UK12 – our UK operating 

business supporting our 17.6 million UK 
consumer and business customers13. The 
majority of Vodafone UK employees work in 
Customer Operations, Retail and Network 
Support, together with colleagues in Sales, 
Technology, Account and Programme 
Management roles.

UK-based employees in Vodafone Group roles:
•  Vodafone Global Enterprise Limited 
(VGEL) – supporting our multinational 
enterprise customers;

•  Vodafone Group Services Limited (VGSL)  

including Vodafone Group Plc – 
supporting our local operating companies 
– and predominantly based in our 
international headquarters in London; and

•  Vodafone Sales and Services Limited 

(VSSL) – supporting the commercial, 
marketing and brand functions, 
predominantly based in our international 
headquarters in London.

VGEL and VGSL account for the very large 
majority of all UK-based employees in 
Vodafone Group roles. While VSSL and 
Vodafone Group Plc are relatively small in 
terms of numbers of employees, we have 
included these two entities in our overall 
metrics as we believe it is appropriate to 
provide a consolidated summary of all 
individuals employed on a UK employment 
contract with Vodafone and paid through the 
Vodafone UK payroll.

These five entities combined cover all 
individuals employed under Vodafone’s terms 
and conditions of employment who are on  
the UK payroll. A small number of individuals 
are employed by entities that are not, as 
of 5 April 2017, using Vodafone terms and 
conditions of employment or are part of the UK 
payroll. Each of these entities has considerably 
fewer than 250 employees as at 5 April 2017 
and is therefore below the reporting threshold 
stipulated in the legislation.

The statutory figures for the in-scope 
legal entities (according to the relevant 
regulation) – Vodafone UK (or Vodafone 
Limited), VGSL (including Vodafone Group Plc) 
and VGEL – can be found in the tables on page 
13 and can also be found individually on the 
government website, as required by  
the legislation. 

Interpretations, judgements  
and assumptions 
There are sections of the legislation and the 
ACAS Guide where different interpretations 
can be made and judgements or assumptions 
are needed. We summarise such instances in 
our reporting below:

i.  International assignments
In our analysis, we have included individuals 
who were employed by a relevant UK entity 
(as at 5 April 2017) but who were assigned to 
an overseas location for a period of time. This 
is on the basis that such individuals have a 
UK employment contract, may well continue 

to have UK tax liabilities that apply to some 
or all of their remuneration and are likely 
to continue to have a home in the UK. We 
therefore consider that these individuals have 
a stronger connection to the UK than their 
host country.

In our analysis, we have excluded employees 
who were employed by a non-UK entity (as at 
5 April 2017) and who were assigned to the UK. 
This is on the basis that those employees will 
continue to be paid from the payroll of their 
home country, are likely to continue to retain 
a home outside the UK and receive ‘home 
leave’ support (the reimbursement of flights to 
their home country from the UK). We therefore 
consider that these individuals have a stronger 
connection to their home country than the UK.

ii.  Trustees and non-executive directors
There is a lack of clear guidance in the 
legislation or ACAS Guide regarding whether  
or not trustees of pension schemes and  
non-executive directors should be included 
in the analysis. We have excluded these 
individuals on the basis that they are not 
employees and do not have a contract of 
employment with Vodafone.

iii. Full pay: relevant employees
Employees on leave who were receiving 
full pay should be included within the 
calculations. We have included employees 
who are recorded in our payroll systems as 
having received at least a 12th of their annual 
salary in the month of April 2017. 

iv. Relevant pay period
The relevant pay period for hourly pay is the 
month of April 2017. 

The relevant pay period for the purpose of 
calculating bonus pay is the 12-month period 
ending on 5 April 2017. As the Vodafone 
payroll is run monthly, for the purposes of 
calculating hourly pay we have considered 
the bonus payments made in the April 2016–
March 2017 (inclusive) payroll, which includes 
all bonus payments in the 12-month period 
prior to 5 April 2017.

v.  Data accuracy
All this data relies on our employees’ 
classification of their own gender.

Vodafone Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Foreword   |   Introduction   |   Vodafone’s gender pay gap   |   Working towards equality   |   Appendix

Independent Limited 
Assurance Report to 
Vodafone Group Plc
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’ or ‘we’) were engaged 
by Vodafone Procurement Company Sarl to 
provide limited assurance to Vodafone Group 
Plc (‘Vodafone’) over the Selected Information 
described below as at 5 April 2017.

Our conclusion
Based on the work we have performed and  
the evidence we have obtained, nothing  
has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the Selected Information listed  
on page 15, has not been properly prepared  
in all material respects, in accordance with  
the Reporting Criteria.

This conclusion is to be read in the context of 
the remainder of this report, in particular the 
inherent limitations explained below and this 
report’s intended use.

Selected Information
The scope of our work includes only the 
information included within Vodafone’s  
Gender Pay Gap Statement (‘the Report’)  
as at 5 April 2017 as listed on page 15  
(‘the Selected Information’). 

We have not performed any work, and do 
not express any conclusion, over any other 
information that may be included in the 
Report or displayed elsewhere, including on 
Vodafone’s website, for the current year or for 
previous periods unless otherwise indicated.

Reporting Criteria
The Reporting Criteria we used to form our 
judgements are Vodafone’s ‘How we report on 
the UK gender pay gap’ Reporting Guidelines 
as set out on pages 12 and 13. The Selected 
Information needs to be read together with the 
Reporting Criteria.

Inherent limitations
The nature of non-financial information; the 
absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw; and the methods 
and precision used to determine non-financial 
information, allow for different, but acceptable 
evaluation and measurement techniques 
and can result in materially different 
measurements, affecting comparability 
between entities and over time. 

We have relied on gender classification data 
in the Vodafone Human Resources IT system 
that originates from employees self-assigning 
their gender during the Vodafone recruitment 
process or when they have subsequently 
requested a change. 

Directors’ responsibilities 
The directors of Vodafone are responsible for:
•  designing, implementing and maintaining 

internal controls relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the Selected Information 
that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error;

•  selecting and/or developing objective 

Reporting Criteria;

•  measuring and reporting the Selected 

Information in accordance with the 
Reporting Criteria; and

•  the contents and statements  

contained within the Report and  
the Reporting Criteria.

Our responsibilities
Our responsibility is to plan and perform 
our work to obtain limited assurance about 
whether Selected Information has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Reporting Criteria and to report to Vodafone in 
the form of an independent limited assurance 
conclusion based on the work performed and 
the evidence obtained.

Assurance standards applied
We performed our work in accordance 
with International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 – ‘Assurance Engagements 
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information’ (‘ISAE 3000’) issued 
by the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board.

The work performed in a limited assurance 
engagement varies in nature and timing from, 
and is less in extent than for, a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Consequently, 
the level of assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is substantially 
lower than the assurance that would have 
been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed.

Independence, professional 
standards and quality control
We comply with the Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants, issued by the 
International Ethics Standards Board for 
Accountants, and we apply International 
Standard on Quality Control (UK and Ireland) 1, 

‘Quality Control for Firms that Perform 
Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, and Other Assurance and Related 
Services Engagements’. Accordingly, we 
maintain a comprehensive system of quality 
control, including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements and professional 
standards (including independence, and 
other requirements founded on fundamental 
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, confidentiality and 
professional behaviour) as well as applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.

Summary of work performed
Considering the level of assurance and 
our assessment of the risk of material 
misstatement of the Selected Information, 
whether due to fraud or error, our work 
included, but was not restricted to:
•  assessing the appropriateness of  

the Reporting Criteria for the  
Selected Information;

•  conducting interviews with Vodafone 

management to obtain an understanding  
of the key processes, systems and  
controls in place over the preparation  
of the Selected Information; 

•  comparing a selection of pay data used 
to prepare the Selected Information to 
Vodafone’s HMRC tax submission and 
payroll records; 

•  comparing the number of Vodafone 
employees’ data used to prepare the 
Selected Information to the Vodafone 
Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 and the 
Human Resources IT system;

14

Vodafone Gender Pay Gap Report 2017Foreword   |   Introduction   |   Vodafone’s gender pay gap   |   Working towards equality   |   Appendix

•  re-performing a selection of the 

calculations used to prepare the Selected 
Information; and

•  reading the Report and narrative in the 

Report accompanying the Selected 
Information with regard to the Reporting 
Criteria, and for consistency with  
our findings. 

This report’s intended use
This assurance report is made solely to 
Vodafone in accordance with the terms of 
the engagement contract between us. Those 
terms permit disclosure to other parties, solely 
for the purpose of Vodafone showing that it 
has obtained an independent assurance report 
in connection with the Selected Information. 

We have not considered the interest of any 
other party in the Selected Information.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
accept no responsibility and deny any liability 
to any party other than Vodafone for our work, 
for this assurance report or for the conclusions  
we have reached.
