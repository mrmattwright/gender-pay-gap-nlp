GENDER PAY GAP

‘Snapshot’ date: 5th April 2017

A message from Simon Trim, CEO of Sporting Group:

We are pleased to report that Sporting Group’s mean and median pay gaps 
are  well  below  the  national  and  relevant  industry  averages,  though  the 
gender balance of the Group is clearly something we would like to improve 
upon.

Our  business  needs  a  large  number  of  trading  and  technology  roles  to 
operate, which has traditionally struggled to attract women, partly due to 
the ongoing legacy and historic recruitment challenges of women working 
in  STEM  roles.  Despite  the  low  numbers  of  women  employed,  we  are 
conﬁdent that men and women are paid equally for doing the equivalent 
jobs  across  our  business, 
from  trading,  technology  and  product 
management to business development and operations. 

Women are equally as likely to receive a bonus as men within the Group, 
with all permanent employees currently eligible to participate in the bonus 
scheme.  The  relatively 
is 
predominantly due to employees joining the company a(cid:29)er cut oﬀ for the 
bonus  awards  in  the  reported  pay  period.  The  gender  gap  in  bonus 
payments is largely due to the low numbers of women in leadership and 
other  roles  (such  as  sales)  where  bonus  payments  standardly  make  up  a 
larger proportion of the overall remuneration received. 

low  proportion  of  female  staﬀ  awarded 

We recognise that women are under-represented across the Group and 
across our leadership roles; however we are committed to change. We 
actively encourage female applicants when recruiting within our business 
and  use  our  family-friendly  working  practices  and  policies  as  a  tool  to 
attract  female  employees.  Here  are  just  some  of  the  ways  we  look  to 
recruit, develop and retain female employees:

• 
• 
• 
• 
 
• 
 

Flexible working practices;
Enhanced maternity and shared parental leave;
Development and study programmes; 
Childcare savings programme and employee discounts  
packages;
Focussed advertising of roles such as via LinkedIn groups  
such as ‘Women in Technology’

 

 

Despite these practices, we still need to attract more women to work in 
our business. We will endeavour to ensure our recruitment process is as 
gender neutral as possible, improve our retention of female staﬀ and step 
up the level of support we provide to talented women who work for us 
which we believe will help us to further close the gap and improve our 
gender balance in the future.
