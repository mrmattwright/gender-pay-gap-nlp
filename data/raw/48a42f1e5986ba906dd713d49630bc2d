  our company culture at ServiceNow. We have published the full data
  required by the UK Government here . The full 2017 data, reported on
  3 rd April 2018, highlights that at ServiceNow we had a mean
  UK gender pay gap of 13.1%, compared with a UK high‑technology
  mean gender pay gap of 25% and an overall UK mean gender pay gap of 18%. 1                         In accordance with the UK Gender Pay Gap Report requirements,
  ServiceNow U.K. report the following data:   13.1 % is  the difference in the mean pay of
    full‑pay men and women  24% is the difference in the median
    pay of full‑pay men and women  40.5% is the difference in
    mean bonus pay of men and women  33.6% is the difference in
    median bonus pay of men and women  The proportion of men and
    women who received bonus pay is 87.2% for men and 87% for women  The proportion of full‑pay men and women in each of four
    quartiles pay bands:                          ServiceNow U.K. confirms that the figures have been reached using the
  mechanisms that are set out in the U.K. gender pay gap reporting legislation.    Sally Sourbron, Senior HR Director, EMEA, ServiceNow   “At ServiceNow, we believe diversity, inclusion and belonging
    promotes creativity and innovation, and helps to attract and retain
    the best talent everywhere we do business. Although progress has
    been made in the U.K. over the past several years we believe more
    can be done to close the U.K. gender pay gap, year‑on‑year. This is
    why we are actively working on initiatives that aim to increase the
    number of women joining our industry, as well as evaluating,
    designing and delivering programs that promote stronger leadership
    development, mobility, and inclusion of women at all levels of our
    organization.”   1  https://www.uk.mercer.com/our‑thinking/the‑gender‑pay‑gap‑in‑uk‑tech‑sector.html   About ServiceNow   ServiceNow makes work better across the enterprise. Getting
