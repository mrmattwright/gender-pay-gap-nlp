GENDER PAY GAP 
REPORT 2017

This report details our April 2016 to April 2017 
results and focus areas to ensure gender equality.

At 3aaa we believe in job opportunity for 
everyone regardless of gender.

We want a diverse and gender balanced 
workforce which reflects the customers 
and communities we serve and ensure 
our people can be their best selves at 
work. As a company we are committed 
to addressing gender representation and 
supporting women in the workplace.

What is the gender pay gap and how is it calculated?

Highest Paid

The Median

Lowest Paid

• 

If all company employees were lined 
up in a female line and a male line, in 
order of pay from highest to lowest, 
the median gender pay gap compares 
the pay of the female in the middle of 
their line and the pay of the middle 
male.

•  Because different jobs pay differently 
and the number of men and women 
performing these jobs varies, a 
gender pay gap exists.

•  The mean gender pay gap shows the 
difference in the average hourly rate 
of pay between men and women in a 
company.

•  This is different from ‘equal pay’, 

which is the difference in pay 
between men and women who carry 
out the same or similar jobs

Our story today

There is no significant gender 
imbalance amongst our workforce.

We create an evenly gender 
balanced workforce by attracting, 
retaining and developing our 
employees. We will continue 
to monitor the gender pay gap 
through insight, analysis and 
robust actions which provide equal 
opportunity, irrespective of gender 
across the organisation.

These activities are organised 
around three key pillars which will 
provide the foundations for our 
longer term equality and diversity 
strategy:

What we’ll focus on next

Our long term goal is to achieve and 
maintain 50/50 gender parity by 2020.

In order to achieve this our people leaders 
need to understand the issues that may 
prevent greater female representation.

All people leaders in 3aaa will receive 
support to ensure our recruitment and hiring 
practices are free from bias.

We will implement Leadership and 
Management programmes and ensure that 
female staff are fairly represented. In doing 
so, we will aim to reduce the imbalance in 
pay in our top quartile of staff.
